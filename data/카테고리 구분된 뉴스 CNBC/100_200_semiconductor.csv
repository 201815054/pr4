Four years before that, it raised the subscription fee to $99 from $79.', 'Amazon’s annual increase amounts to about a 17% rise in price. Amazon also raised the monthly price of a Prime membership from $12.99 to $14.99, the company said. New members will see the increased prices on Feb. 18, and current members will be billed at the higher rate after March 25.', 'Amazon stock rose more than 14% at one point on Thursday in extended trading.', 'Launched in 2005, Amazon Prime gives members access to free two-day shipping, as well as access to exclusive movies and TV shows, among other perks. As of last April, the service had more than 200 million subscribers worldwide. ', 'The membership program remains one of the biggest growth levers for Amazon’s core retail business. Prime members spend considerably more on Amazon than non-Prime customers, and they also shop more often.', 'Amazon is raising the price of Prime as it navigates the dual challenges of continued supply chain disruptions and labor constraints. The company raised wages and offered generous signing bonuses to attract workers in a tight labor market. To avoid delivery disruptions, it rerouted packages over longer and costlier distances to get them to facilities with enough staff to handle them.', 'The cost of keeping Prime members hooked on the service has also become more expensive for Amazon. The company spends billions of dollars annually to add more compelling video and music content to its streaming service. And, in recent years, Amazon has poured money into building out its logistics and fulfillment network to make one-day shipping the default nationwide.']"

PC sales have been elevated since the start of the pandemic in 2020, including during last year’s December quarter.', '“I wouldn’t read anything into the quarter-on-quarter,” Gelsinger said, adding that supply constraints were also a factor.', 'Gelsinger said that he expects PC sales to remain strong. Microsoft on Tuesday reported that revenue in its personal computing group climbed almost 16% from a year earlier, topping estimates, and CEO Satya Nadella said that demand is strong across the business.', 'Intel’s Data Center Group unit also topped expectations, with revenue rising 20% to $7.3 billion, compared to the average estimate of $6.7 billion.', '“The Q4 was really marked by the on-premise, enterprise, and government sector strength,” Gelsinger said.

But there’s a new version of the EUV machine in the pipeline, dubbed High NA, that could allow chipmakers to build even more sophisticated chips to power the next generation of electronic devices. NA stands for numerical aperture.', 'ASML was born in 1984 when electronics giant Philips and chip-machine manufacturer Advanced Semiconductor Materials International decided to create a new company to develop lithography systems for the growing semiconductor industry. Called ASM Lithography, the company began its work inauspiciously — in a shed next to a Philips office in Eindhoven.', 'Today, ASML is valued at $329 billion, and some tech investors expect it to be worth $500 billion by the end of 2022. It is the biggest tech company in Europe by market value and one of the biggest in the world. It employs over 31,000 employees across the Netherlands, the United States, South Korea, Taiwan and mainland China.', 'EUV machines shine exceptionally narrow beams of light onto silicon wafers that have been treated with “photoresist” chemicals. Intricate patterns are created on the wafer where the light comes into contact with the chemicals, which are carefully laid out beforehand. This process, which leads to the formation of the all-important transistors, is known as lithography.', 'Transistors are one of the basic building blocks of modern electronics, and they enable an electric current to flow around a circuit. Generally speaking, the more transistors you can fit onto a chip, the more powerful and efficient that chip will be.', 'Not every lithography system that ASML makes has EUV capabilities. EUV is the company’s latest technology, which it introduced for high-volume manufacturing a few years ago. DUV (deep ultraviolet) is still the workhorse of the industry.', 'Chris Miller, an assistant professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, told CNBC that chipmakers want to use the narrowest wavelength of light possible in lithography so that they can fit more transistors onto each piece of silicon. The TSMC chips in the latest Apple iPhones, which were created with ASML’s EUV machines, have around 10 billion transistors on them.', 'High NA is set to be even bigger, more expensive and more complicated than ASML’s current EUV machine.', '“It includes a novel optics design and requires significantly faster stages,” an ASML spokesperson told CNBC. They added that the High NA machine has a higher resolution that will enable 1.7x smaller chip features and 2.9x increased chip density.', '“With this platform, customers will reduce the numbers of process steps,” the spokesperson continued. “This will be a strong motivation for them to adopt the technology. The platform will offer significant defect, cost and cycle time reductions.”', 'For context, each of the current EUV machines reportedly has over 100,000 components, and they take 40 freight containers or four jumbo jets to ship. They cost around $140 million each, according to reports.', '“They’re not resting on their laurels,” said Miller, adding that the company’s new machine will allow even more specific etchings on silicon chips.', 'The first High NA machine is still under development and it’s set to be available for early access from 2023 so that chipmakers can start experimenting with it and learn how to make it work.', 'Customers will then be able use them for their own research and development in 2024 and 2025. They’re likely to be used in high-volume manufacturing from 2025 onward.', 'In July, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said the company expects to be the first recipient of ASML’s High NA machine.', '“I would bet that he paid a lot for that right because he’s certainly not the only person that would like to get their hands on this machine first,” Miller said.', 'Maurits Tichelman, a vice president of sales and marketing at Intel, told CNBC: “High NA EUV is the next major technology change on the EUV roadmap.”', 'He added: “We are positioned to\u202freceive the first\u202fproduction High NA\u202fEUV tool in the industry\u202fand are driving to enable its introduction in 2025,” Tichelman said. He declined to say how many machines Intel has ordered.', 'The new High NA EUV tool shifts from a .33 aperture lens to a sharper .55 aperture to enable higher resolution patterning, Tichelman said.', 'A higher aperture allows for a wider EUV beam inside the machine before it hits the wafer. The wider this beam, the more intense it can be when it hits the wafer, which increases how accurately lines are printed. This in turn enables smaller geometries and much smaller pitches, increasing density.', 'Alan Priestley, a semiconductor analyst at Gartner, told CNBC that ASML’s new machine will allow chip manufacturers to make chips below three nanometers. The most advanced chips in the world are currently three nanometers and above.', 'The High NA machines will cost about $300 million, which is twice as much as the existing EUV machines, and they’ll need complex new lens technology, Priestley added.', 'Chips are often comprised of 100-150 layers on one single silicon wafer. Only the most complicated layers need to be made with EUV machines, while more simple layers can be made with DUV machines, which ASML also makes, and other tools.', 'EUV machines take years to build and ASML can only ship so many of them in any given year. Last year, it sold just 31, according to its financials, and it’s made around only 100 in total.', '“Compared to traditional EUV machines, a High NA machine provides a bigger lens capable of printing smaller patterns, enabling efficient manufacturing of more powerful chips,” said Syed Alam, global semiconductor lead at Accenture.', '“Chipmakers looking to print smaller features onto chips have had to rely on double or triple patterning techniques, which is time-consuming,” he added. “With a High NA EUV machine, they are able to print these features in a single layer, resulting in a faster turnaround time and better process flexibility.”', 'Chipmakers will have to strike a balance between better performance and the greater costs associated with more sophisticated machinery, Alam said.', '“This is particularly true with High NA EUV machines where larger lenses imply higher acquisition and maintenance costs,” he said.', 'Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that a single wafer often comprises of 100-150 layers.']"

The news sent Crocs shares soaring; the stock was recently up about 7%.', 'Chief Executive Andrew Rees explained on an earnings call a key advantage is the fact that the retailer’s clog shoes are easy to make and so the company faces fewer hurdles in shifting production around when needed.', '“Our shoes are really simple, and so [swapping] factories can be very, very quick,” Rees explained. “The classic clog has three components, two of which are made on site, so you don’t have a lot of external logistics to be able to get started. We think we’re competent in terms of rapid manufacturing.”', 'Crocs was quick to begin diversifying its manufacturing overseas, especially with facilities in Vietnam facing prolonged shutdowns due to pandemic lockdowns in the region. In the short term, the company said it has moved some production back to China and Bosnia. It’s also ramping up production in Indonesia, and it has a facility in India expected to be online by next year.', 'Vietnam has traditionally represented a significant chunk of Crocs’ manufacturing base. It was expected to account for about 70% of production by the end of this year, the company said, but will be less due to Crocs’ diversification efforts.', 'As of this week, most of the retailer’s factories in Vietnam are operational again, according to Rees. Workers are coming back to plants “pretty effectively,” he added. But Rees said Crocs is still cautiously planning for an “on again, off again” situation in the region.', 'Meantime, to avoid massive logjams at West Coast ports, the company said it has been building a larger presence along the East Coast to reach its customers in the United States. Crocs has also been using air freight instead of cargo transportation to move orders in preparation for spring and summer of next year.', '“We will prioritize our most important channels,” Rees said.', 'Crocs is anticipating some inflation next year, primarily from heightened freight and wage costs, it said. The retailer has already slightly increased the prices of some of its clog shoes. Pulling back on promotions has also helped to balance out inflationary pressures.', '“We’re proactively looking at other measures and things that we can do to kind of offset any inflationary pressures,” Chief Financial Officer Anne Mehlman told analysts.', 'Crocs shares have soared more than 140% year to date. The company has a market cap of $9.3 billion.']"

Most notably, Morgan Stanley lead auto analyst Adam Jonas dubbed Rivian as “the one” to be able to compete against EV industry leader Tesla.', 'But Rivian, like the rest of the automotive industry, is facing massive supply disruptions and has internally experienced expected, but still problematic, production snags that caused it to miss its production expectations last year.', 'The company’s stock price is off by more than 60% this year, as investors look for safer ground than an EV start-up amid recession fears.', 'Scaringe is aware of such problems but, like he has for more than a decade, remains focused on the mission at hand: to prove the company’s worth by actually producing vehicles, an ironic differentiator for the industry that separates Rivian from an influx of new EV start-ups in recent years. Rivian is currently producing the electric R1T pickups as well as Amazon delivery vans and some R1S SUVs.', 'Here’s what Scaringe had to say on the company’s production, parts shortages and more.', 'Scaringe said Rivian remains “really confident” it can produce 25,000 vehicles, including van and R1 models, in 2022. That estimate is down from initial expectations of about 50,000 vehicles, slashed by supplier disruptions.', 'Scarcity in semiconductor chips, a shortage the auto industry has been battling for more than a year now, and wire harnesses, which act as the nerves of a vehicle, poses the biggest hurdles for the company.

It’s just a small percentage,” Scaringe said. “It doesn’t take more than one part to stop the production.”', 'Scaringe doesn’t expect semiconductor supplies to normalize until next year.

The first vans go to Amazon, Rivian’s largest shareholder with a 20% stake, followed eventually by deliveries to other companies.', 'Rivian says the vans can be produced faster than the consumer R1T and R1S vehicles because they have fewer features. They also go through fewer processes at the plant. For example, the painting of the vans – a tedious and long process – takes two hours less than paint jobs for the other vehicles.', 'Victor Taylor, senior director of stamping, body and plastic for the company, also noted there’s less complexity and time needed for the vans in the body shop.', 'Rivian, to the dismay of reservation holders, increased prices for its vehicles last month due to higher commodity costs. The company quickly rolled back the increases for its 70,000-some existing reservation holders but said it would hold to the updated pricing for new reservations made as of March 1.', 'The increases make the starting prices of the vehicles $67,500 for the R1T and $72,500 for the R1S. At those prices, both are considered luxury vehicles rather than mainstream models.', 'Scaringe said the company plans to produce lower-priced vehicles on its next-generation EV platform. Those vehicles will be manufactured at a planned $5 billion plant in Georgia, which is expected to come online in 2024.', 'Much like other automakers, Rivian also plans to maximize profits and increase performance of current models, according to Scaringe.', 'It’s the beginning of the end of fossil fuel-powered consumer vehicles — as far as Scaringe is concerned. The 39-year-old believes production and sales of such vehicles will come to an end in his lifetime, sooner rather than later.', 'Without putting an exact date on it, Scaringe said the end of that era is likely closer to 20 years from now rather than 50 years, with companies forced to move way from fossil fuels out of necessity as well as potential pressures from Wall Street and regulators.', '“Most countries around the world will stop selling gas engine-powered cars. The scale of the shift is hard to fully appreciate,” he said. “The challenge is whether it’s driven by policy or not. The businesses that are going to survive are the ones that recognize that the end state for combustion is zero.”', 'Rivian is among a flurry of EV start-ups to have gone public in recent years, but the company’s competitors have done so through deals with special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs.

But he said the company will “offer lots of different products in the future.”', 'Scaringe, who moved from Southern California to near the 3.3 million-square-foot plant, is known as a driven, level-headed planner who typically lets his actions speak louder than his words (or tweets). It’s a different style from Musk, though both are considered extremely detail-oriented and ambitious leaders.', 'Rivian became the first automaker to begin mass production of an all-electric pickup truck last year, beating to market Tesla and longtime segment leaders General Motors and Ford Motor, which holds a roughly 12% stake in Rivian.', 'GM started shipping its GMC Hummer EV pickup in December, months after Rivian launched the R1T. Ford is expected to soon begin shipping an electric version of its F-150 pickup, called the F-150 Lightning, followed by Tesla’s long-delayed Cybertruck, which is planned to go into production next year.', 'While there have been many comparisons of the Rivian R1T to the other electric pickups, Scaringe isn’t bothered by the competition. He actually welcomes it, for now. He believes there’s currently more than enough demand to fulfill EV pickup production in the near term.', '“Humans have an infatuation with winners and losers, like everything in life has to be a zero-sum game,” he said. “I really just don’t see it that way. ... I look at it as I hope Hummer’s wildly successful. I truly do. I hope Lightning’s wildly successful, and I hope we’re wildly successful.

The coronavirus outbreak was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, and has since spread to the rest of the world, ravaging demand as well as the global economy.', 'He attributed the expected rebound to three main factors:', '“What we’ve seen in the last two or three months, those items around the home — whether it’s home improvements or enhancements to people’s home offices, electronics or even exercise bicycles — we’re seeing that sector has really picked up, and a lot of that production actually moves in containers as opposed to air freight,” Nixon explained.', 'ONE’s liner network services more than 100 countries, operating in a sector that moves over 90% of global goods, which gives the company a unique window into global economic activity.', 'Though there appears to be a rising tide lifting most boats, the group’s CEO says some pockets of weakness remain. “A lot of the automotive production, whether in Europe, America, Asia — particularly in Japan — is still quite weak,” Nixon explained.', 'On a regional basis, the recovery has become more widespread as lockdown measures ease. “Maybe some of the demand around intra-Asia is still recovering but we can see Europe is strong, North America is strong and even Latin America has picked up as well.”', 'Nixon cautions, however, that relative to the V-shaped recovery that the industry witnessed in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the current rebound looks more fragile.', '“Our exuberance is curtailed at the moment because we don’t really know how 2021-22 is going to play out. How much of this is a temporary build up in demand?” He also pointed to the risk that in Winter “some pickup in the pandemic situation means curtailment of certain activities and production.”', 'Before Covid-19 threatened to devastate container shipping, the sector was already grappling with the U.S.-China trade war and the specter of additional tariffs.', 'Nixon played down fears, however, that a further deterioration in ties between the world’s two largest economies could dent the industry’s recovery in the months ahead.', '“We don’t really like the tension.

That puts RS1 in the middle of the commercial launch market, between Rocket Lab’s small Electron for $7 million and SpaceX’s heavy Falcon 9 for $62 million.', 'It also pits ABL against several other companies developing “medium-lift” rockets that are aiming to reach orbit this year, such as Richard Branson’s Virgin Orbit, Relativity Space and Firefly Aerospace.', 'RS1 is made of an aluminum alloy and, when ABL first set out designing the rocket, Piemont said the company got quotes from suppliers on how much it would cost using traditional manufacturing processes for each part.', 'But then ABL set about vertically integrating as many parts of RS1′s manufacturing as possible, such as designing the E2 engines to be 3D-printed in three pieces, so as to fit in readily available metal printers.', '“With the verticalization we’ve done — as well as the process improvements we found in the primary structures, turbopumps, engines, avionics and elsewhere — we’re looking at about 25% of th', 'at quoted cost,” Piemont said, or “about a 75% cost savings based on that portfolio of improvements.”', 'O’Hanley and Piemont met as undergraduates at MIT, before the former went to work at SpaceX for nearly six years and the latter started his career with Morgan Stanley’s institutional finance group. But in mid-2017, O’Hanley began bouncing ideas off of Piemont about starting a new rocket company and the pair decided to found it together, officially incorporating ABL in August 2017.', '“The way we’ve built our company in every domain has always been bottoms up, we’ve never hired a VP,” O’Hanley said. “When we realized we needed to have machine shop, we hired a machinist and bought one machine.”', 'Piemont said ABL’s “second hire was actually a web developer,” because “all the software we use to run our processes is custom.” He and O’Hanley wanted even ABL’s manufacturing software to be built in-house, so that “before we even started designing the vehicle, we’re entering software systems of use for purchasing inventory, filing work orders and build orders, run test operations and collect data for review.”', '“We’ve been building that side of our infrastructure, along with the vehicle itself, which is I think been an underrated aspect of how we stay nimble and move fast,” Piemont added.', 'ABL now has about 105 employees, with about 90,000 square feet of space in several buildings in El Segundo, as well as testing facilities at Edwards Air Force Base and at Spaceport America in New Mexico.', '“We can build and ship a launch vehicle about every 30 days, based on infrastructure we have now,” Piemont said. “We’re tracking towards eight or nine [rockets] a year based on existing infrastructure.”', 'While ABL has significant contracts and relationships with the Pentagon, Piemont said the company’s customer pipeline is 60% private, or commercial, versus 40% government payloads. The company has customers lined up to launch payloads on its first few missions, although ABL may fly mass simulators, which are often a slab of concrete to represent a spacecraft’s weight, for the first RS1 launch.', 'Spending $100 million has been the benchmark for a 21st century rocket builder to reach orbit for the first time. SpaceX and Rocket Lab, the two private companies currently flying regularly, each spent roughly that much — and even Astra, which came just shy of reaching orbit with its first space launch last month, had raised about $100 million from investors.', 'But ABL thinks it will reach orbit in under four years since its founding, and for less.', '“Our total expenditures through the day we ran the integrated stage test in October was $25 million, which gives us the high confidence that we will complete the orbital program for well under $100 million,” Piemont said.', 'Beyond the rocket itself, ABL also touts the efficiency of its GS0 deployable ground system. It’s essentially the barebones of a launch facility — the erector, fueling, electrical, control center and more — all packed into a few standard-sized shipping containers.', '“The GS0 system give us some huge advantages, because infrastructurally all we need is a flat concrete pad and everything else we can build here at El Segundo and then deliver to the site,” Piemont said.', 'The system’s development is complete, with ABL now constructing GS0. In addition to flexibility and simplicity, ABL sees GS0 as enabling “responsive launching,” O’Hanley explained — a feature the U.S military is interested in utilizing.', '“We’ve actually got a contract with the Space Force to demonstrate some of those activities on the ground, where we’re basically working with them to bring a rocket vertical and see how quickly we can fill it and prepare for launch operations,” O’Hanley said.', '“Short call time is a huge sublime business for what we’re doing, and we have a set of concepts for the DOD where you can have RS1s stored on base, ready to launch for this rapid call up time. Part of having the lightweight launch infrastructure, the mobile launch site, is to enable that,” he added.', 'He noted that ABL will be conducting that demonstration for the Space Force later this year.', 'The practice, and not just the theory, of reusing rockets to save money and time has gained steady traction in the past few years, in large part due to SpaceX’s success landing its rocket boosters. Rocket Lab has also begun to attempt to recover its Electron rocket, despite originally designing the boosters to be expendable.', 'While RS1 is designed to be expendable, O’Hanley and Piemont stressed that ABL has not ruled out working to upgrade the rocket to be reusable in the future.', '“Economically, if we throw these away every time, that’s totally fine for our purposes and the books look great,” O’Hanley said. “If we did a reusable rocket, it would likely be motivated by logistics and cycle time, manufacturing, more so than cost.”', 'Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck has similarly cited production speed as a primary reason for reusing rockets, rather than the cost savings advantage that SpaceX leadership frequently points to as its motivation.', 'O’Hanley said ABL is not thinking about reuse ahead of its first launch, as “right now it’s minimize scope, get to the pad, be successful.”', '“I think as we scale up we will evaluate it after first launch,” O’Hanley said.', 'He added that ABL has the right team to add reusability to its rockets, as he led work on the “grid fin” system that SpaceX uses to control its Falcon 9 rockets during return through the atmosphere. Other employees having similar strong reusability pedigrees — such as members of the team that did the first refurbishment of a Falcon 9.', '“So reuse is not in the current near-term plans, but it’s something that we probably are set up for in the future,” O’Hanley said.', 'Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.']"
18,Facebook’s Meta mission was laid out in a 2018 paper declaring ‘The Metaverse is ours to lose’,2021-10-30T12:16:18+0000,"['In June 2018, Oculus executive Jason Rubin sent an email to Facebook board member Marc Andreessen with the subject line “The Metaverse.”', '“We believe that the right way to break through consumer indifference to VR is to deliver what they expect and want from the medium: THE METAVERSE,” reads the first slide of a 50-page document outlining a strategy for building a virtual world.', 'The three-year-old document, obtained by CNBC, laid the foundation for the futuristic ambitions of Meta, the company that until now was called Facebook. CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s hour-long demo on Thursday, which culminated in the announcement of the new company name, was designed to portray a very different world than the one we currently inhabit at a time when Facebook faces a non-stop barrage of negative headlines tied to the addictive nature of its social media products.', 'Zuckerberg told viewers that the company sees the metaverse, which will take five to 10 years to go mainstream, as the next frontier in technology — the place where people will live, work and play. His presentation came just days after the company announced in its earnings report that the Reality Labs hardware division will become its own financial reporting segment as of the fourth quarter.', 'The paper sent to Andreessen in 2018 now looks like the first draft of history. It imagined users floating through a digital universe of virtual ads, filled with virtual goods that people buy. There would be virtual people that they marry, while spending as little time as possible in the so-called “meatverse” — referring to the real world because humans are flesh and blood.  Rubin used the phrase “shock and awe” 12 times to describe the desired experience.', 'Andreessen was a critical recipient, not just because he’s been on Facebook’s board since 2008, but also due to his influence in this specific space. Through his firm, Andreessen was an early backer of Oculus and also put money into Roblox, the gaming platform for kids that’s focused on building its own metaverse.', 'The document was also sent to Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, the head of Facebook’s hardware division, who was promoted in July to chief technology officer (starting next year) and to Hugo Barra, the company’s vice president of virtual reality. The person who shared the document with CNBC wasn’t authorized to speak about it, but Rubin confirmed its validity in an interview on Friday.', '“The Metaverse is ours to lose,” reads one of the first section heads in Rubin’s paper. He went on to say that Facebook started thinking about the concept of the metaverse as a way to appeal to general consumers, because VR wasn’t broadly popular.', 'Facebook acquired Oculus for $2 billion in 2014, and as of June 2018, the company’s VR headsets had amassed 250,000 monthly active players, according to the document. But despite hundreds of millions of dollars invested in content for “early adopters and pioneers,” Rubin wrote that the devices hadn’t caught on with non-hardcore gamers and “the average consumer is waiting for the day that VR is ‘fully baked.’”', '“We believe that ‘fully baked’ means the metaverse,” Rubin wrote. “Only such a massive launch will be able to get the attention of VR doubter and VR-maybe-tomorrow crowd.”', 'Rubin, whose title at Meta is now vice president of metaverse content, told CNBC that his paper was read fairly widely, but it wasn’t the only one getting attention. ', '“A lot of people had visions of the metaverse at the time, and there were various documents that were floating around with various opinions,” Rubin said on Friday. “I wanted to get mine out there. That’s how we create things here at Facebook. There’s a lot of ideas, a lot of people and they kind of boil up. I’d like to think that some of it was useful.”', 'Rubin predicted in the paper that the project could potentially be built in four years and that Facebook could go it alone. But he now realizes that it will take more time and that Meta is going to have to partner with a wide array of companies rather than owning and controlling the whole system.', '“That’s another way in which we’ve evolved our thinking,” said Rubin, who was previously an executive in the video game industry. “We have to work with others, we have to build it in a lot of steps because it’s going to take a long time.”', 'When he wrote the document, Rubin indicated he wasn’t sure how much time Facebook would have. He just knew it was important to “go for the kill” and outrun the competition', '“The first metaverse that gains real traction is likely to the be the last,” Rubin wrote. “We must act first, and go big, or we risk being one of those wannabes.”', 'Facebook had the potential to effectively shut competitors like Google, Apple, Sony, HTC and Valve out of the VR market, he wrote, adding that Sony was focused on the PlayStation 5, HTC was unhappy with its potential hardware partners and Facebook was investing more than Valve, the maker of Steam.', '“Google and Apple don’t really exist in VR in any real way yet,” the document said. “Daydream is a joke,” Rubin wrote, referencing a VR platform that Google ended up discontinuing a year later.', 'He also wasn’t keen to partnering at the time. There was no point in working closely with other potential rivals, because Facebook should be where all users go for their virtual experiences, the document says.', '“Let’s not build the Metaverse with the plan to help other Platforms accumulate and retain consumers,” Rubin wrote. “Let’s build the Metaverse to keep them from being in the VR business in a meaningful way at all.”', 'Rubin emphasized on Friday that the company has moved away from that approach and that the plan is for the metaverse be interoperable and open, not “restrictive to one company.”', 'A Meta spokesperson said in an emailed statement that technology has evolved since 2018, when the focus was mainly VR. The company said it has always expected competition in the market from Microsoft, Google, Apple, Sony, Roblox and many others.', '“What has always been clear: investing in and building products that consumers want is the key to success; that we cannot build the metaverse alone; and that collaboration with developers, creators, and experts will be critical,” the spokesperson said.', 'In one section, Rubin outlines a scenario featuring a fictional user named Priya, who visits the metaverse. Priya enters a virtual city equipped with a bowling alley, stores, theaters and a Facebook pavilion described as “the largest building, almost church like in its dominance of the square.” ', 'Priya can interact with others and use the metaverse currency to pay for her avatar’s new hair style. Priya eventually meets another user who looks like a green and warty ogre. They end up getting married.', '“The only thing she spends as much time doing as she spends in the Metaverse is working, eating, socializing, and sleeping in the IRL ‘MEATverse,’” Rubin wrote. “Her entertainment time is spent more and more virtually. This is aided by Netflix, Facebook, Instagram and other Metaverse integrations.”', 'A decade into this hypothetical scenario, Rubin says the company’s metaverse would reach 100 million hardware units sold, with 50% being Oculus branded or licensed and the rest coming from other hardware makers.', 'Within two decades, time spent in the metaverse could rival that of “TV in the 90′s and Facebook in recent years.” And most importantly for Facebook, “net revenue after developer payout is billions a year,” he wrote. That would come from the sale of virtual real estate, hats, weapons and status symbols.', 'Revenue would also come from ads, the market Facebook knows best. Rubin imagines Coca-Cola paying for prime placement of a pavilion, Ford paying for its virtual cars to be usable or Procter & Gamble promoting its brands on digital billboards. Gucci could open a virtual store and Comcast (owner of CNBC parent NBCUniversal) would pay for “a giant sign that says, ‘Comcast: Get Better MetaSpeed!’”', '“If the Metaverse is where people are spending time, then it is where the real economy will want to be,” Rubin wrote. “It is our goal to bring the Metaverse to this stage. Anything short doesn’t seem like it is a Facebook product.”', 'Given that deep level of immersion, Rubin estimated that 100 million metaverse users could lead to more revenue than a real universe with one billion users.', '“I might check in to Facebook multiple times a day, but I will LIVE in the Metaverse, work in the Metaverse, and potentially prefer my time in the Metaverse to my day-to-day grind,” the document says.', 'To be successful, Rubin writes, the metaverse has to be scary. That is, it has to to be so ambitious, so bold, so filled with thousands of hours of gameplay, so life-altering that Facebook engineers are terrified of what they’re up against.', '“If delivering the Metaverse we set out to build doesn’t scare the living hell out of us, then it is not the Metaverse we should be building, it is not what customers want, and it is, therefore, meaningless,” he wrote. “Anything else is a Mini-verse.”', 'Building all of that and reaching the universe of customers necessary, Rubin wrote, would require more than just internal resources. He suggested that Facebook would need a gaming studio with a team of more than 100 people that could create a massive multiplayer online game.', '“One thing is absolutely clear: There is no team inside Facebook with the cohesion and experience of shipping large, technically challenging, awe-inspiring game/interactive product that is capable of producing the City,” Rubin wrote, referring to the digital world the company was aiming to build. “For these reasons, we are going to need to make an acquisition.”', 'He named as potential targets Insomniac Games and Gearbox Software. Other studios like Blizzard and Rockstar were too big and too profitable for an acquisition and too committed to their own universe.', 'Rubin ended up recommending Ready at Dawn, the studio behind “Lone Echo.” Facebook did the deal in June 2020.', 'In addition to the metaverse’s technological achievements, the launch of the product would be critical and would need to “create shock and awe,” Rubin wrote.', 'Zuckerberg should avoid going up on stage at a conference with a slide behind him that reads, “Welcome to the Metaverse” if the company isn’t ready to meet the moment.', '“If we telegraph every step of our roadmap because we have keynote minutes to fill, the competition will always be one step behind,” Rubin wrote. “Let’s not do that. Let’s wait until we have a Metaverse worthy of the name — a Fait Accompli.”', 'Zuckerberg didn’t fully heed that call. His presentation on Thursday was bold, but the world he depicted is nowhere near ready for consumer navigation.', 'The demo was a Pixar-like animation, showcasing software the company hopes to build. It was filled with users hanging out and working out as avatars or cartoonish versions of themselves. Zuckerberg acknowledged that the technology is a long way off, potentially as far as a decade into the future.', 'Some suggested that Facebook needed to change the conversation and distract the public after six damaging weeks of stories based on leaked documents from a whistleblower.', 'Rubin had a different explanation. He said the company now knows that to achieve its herculean mission, it needs to bring others along for the ride, kissing goodbye to the walled garden approach.', '“This is a long journey that we’re going to be on with a lot of different companies,” Rubin said in the interview. “And you just can’t keep it under wraps that long.” ', '— CNBC’s Samantha Subin contributed to this report.', 'WATCH: Facebook name change more for investors and employees']"

This isn’t a new business activity for us. It’s the same old customers and same old markets, but with an architecture that is better and more disruptive,” Telesat CEO Dan Goldberg told CNBC.

The cost of the satellites make up the bulk of that total, as Goldberg said the contract with Thales Alenia Space is worth about $3 billion.', 'Notably, Goldberg clarified that Telesat’s Lightspeed constellation is not designed to compete with the direct-to-consumer networks of SpaceX’s Starlink or Amazon’s Kuiper.', '“This is not a consumer broadband play,” Goldberg said. “We’re one of the largest satellite operators in the world today and we’ve been doing this for 50 years now. But we’ve always been an enterprise kind of service provider ... we know that customer base, we know those markets. We collaborated with those customers when we conceived of this opportunity and designed this constellation.”', 'Goldberg explained that Telesat’s Lightspeed customers include cruise ships, airlines, and rural municipalities.

Telesat will also “be announcing other launch providers in the coming months.”', 'One of the key technologies that Goldberg said the Lightspeed satellites will leverage is intersatellite links — which allow satellites to create data connections to each other, rather than individually connecting to points on the ground.', '“We’re basically deploying a big space-based mesh IP network, which means all of our satellites are always online and being able to be revenue-generating and connected to a user,” Goldberg said.', 'Intersatellite links are key to reducing the number of points on the ground that the satellite constellation needs to connect to, as well as increase the overall speed of the global network. Goldberg said that Telesat plans to deploy about 30 ground stations around the world, “because we don’t need that many” and it helps “minimize capital investment and spending on the ground.”', 'Telesat has also been working to decrease the reflectivity of its Lightspeed satellites, after SpaceX’s Starlink was hit by a public outcry by astronomers that it’s hundreds of satellites appeared  as bright streaks across images taken by telescopes. Goldberg noted that the Lightspeed satellites will be at about twice the altitude the Starlink satellites, while also having a fraction as many in the total constellation. Telesat’s Lightspeed satellites are also designed to last about 10 to 12 years each, so the company doesn’t have to replace them too frequently.', '“We’ve been using space for 50 years — we’re a responsible industrial user of space.

Unfortunately, 2022 could be another year of new highs as home prices continue to appreciate two-to three-times faster than a year ago — across all cities, according to CoreLogic Deputy Chief Economist Selma Hepp. “An expected increase in mortgage rates next year will present further challenges,” she added.', 'Pro tip: Higher rates could help dampen demand for homes, at least a little, which may result in less dramatic home price growth and fewer bidding wars, eventually making it easier for some homebuyers to get in the door. And with rent prices going up, it will still be a good time buy.  ', 'Going to the grocery store is going to start eating away at your budget very quickly. It’s not just staples like eggs, meat and milk that are getting more expensive; Coca-Cola and PepsiCo also announced price increases, thanks to more supply-chain and labor problems.

And yet, in some states, including Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois and Kentucky, gas prices are likely to bump up even further “very soon” due, in part, to a rise in wholesale prices, according to GasBuddy.com.', 'Pro tip: Depending on where you live, there can be big price swings between gas stations. Even if the difference in price per gallon doesn’t seem like much, it can still add up to hundreds of dollars a year.', 'Restaurants have been under pressure since the very start of the pandemic and ongoing staffing challenges aren’t going away anytime soon.

By early May, Bookshop has been selling more than 10,000 books a day to 175,000 customers before spending a dollar on advertising, according to Hunter.', 'Bookshop’s timing was uncanny. The site, which provides an easy way for independent booksellers to set up online storefronts for delivery orders, launched in beta on Jan. 28. After a steady first five weeks, Hunter said, the business began to take off as stay-at-home orders proliferated across the U.S.', '“My goal was to capture 1% of Amazon’s book market, and we’re there now; we’re over 1% of their sales,” he said in a phone interview in late April. “I thought it was going to take three years to get there, and instead it took 11 weeks.”', 'While the pandemic threatens to cripple small businesses such as book stores and restaurants that tend to rely on foot traffic, it’s also creating opportunities for some online businesses to expand. Bookshop’s early success shows that Amazon may not be the only e-commerce business to come out of the pandemic stronger than before. As the retail giant has been forced to loosen its speedy delivery times in the face of unprecedented demand and inventory shortages, smaller e-commerce services have also seen a boom as consumers scramble to find goods online.', 'Demand for grocery delivery has spilled over to several smaller services now working to quickly ramp up capacity.

Two local delivery services in New York City, Go Organic NYC and Farm to People, have seen a wave of new customers and been forced to rapidly expand their facilities to keep up with the demand.', 'Prior to the pandemic, Go Organic mainly stocked corporate offices with produce. But with many of their customers now working from home, the company has become an entirely residential delivery service. The shift allowed it to take on hundreds of new customers in the first two to three weeks of the crisis, according to Brian Lai, president and part owner.

While Farm to People used to rely mostly on targeted marketing on Instagram or through events, Robinov said lots of customers now seem to be coming through referrals.

CEO Mike Petters said the company is looking for workers in craft and design positions as the market for shipbuilding is improving. With suppliers in all 50 states and 37,000 employees around the globe, the company builds nuclear-powered aircraft and submarines at its Newport News, Virginia, shipyard, and non-nuclear ships such as cutters and destroyers in Pascagoula, Mississippi.', '“We have dozens of crafts that are involved in the building of the ships — it’s pipefitters, welders, painters, insulators, sheet metal workers,” Petters said. “Just about anything you can imagine you might need in building a city, we use, because, frankly, that is what we are building.”', 'Now Trump is also calling for a major expansion of the U.S. military, to the tune of $603 billion, with a $54 billion budgetary boost in defense spending. Among the president’s priorities is to expand the Navy: He’s calling for 350 ships, up from today’s 274, marking the largest naval buildup since the Cold War.', 'That move would mean more business and jobs after years of stagnation due to constraints under the government’s sequestration of funds. The president has made repeated calls for Congress to eliminate the Defense sequester, which places spending caps until 2021. “By eliminating the sequester and the uncertainty it creates, it will make it easier for the Navy to plan for the future, and thus control costs and get the best deals for the taxpayer, which of course is very important,” Trump said last week at Huntington Ingalls’ Newport News shipyard. Still, a divided Congress stands in Trump’s way. “There are political dynamics in Washington that aren’t going to let him achieve a larger military without consequences,” said Roman Schweizer, senior aerospace defense and policy analyst at Cowen. “I think it’s going to be difficult for him to get what he wants.” ', 'The company is also investing in training apprentices like Jeffery Cofer, a 26-year-old Iraq War veteran. Cofer served in the National Guard in 2011 and now serves his country by building ships for the Navy. His prior service experience gives him a unique perspective on constructing equipment to be used by U.S. servicemen and women. “While I was in Iraq, one of my greatest fears was that we would have some kind of a mechanical or system failure due to a lack of quality,” Cofer recalled. “I didn’t want something that was avoidable to cause me injury or kill me. I don’t want our sailors to have that fear — I want them to know that the work I do here and we do here is quality work, and we deliver good ships.”', 'Cofer has spent the past three years working toward completing his 8,000 hours to be a pipefitter, studying everything from basic math to naval architecture. Entry-level salaries range from $36,000 to $57,000 a year, with opportunities for overtime and benefits. The ships built by Huntington Ingalls last for up to 50 years, Petters said. “What we have is the opportunity for you to do something with your hands, and your head, and your heart that will be bigger than yourself,” he said. “You get to be part of a big team that is going to be playing a very important role in American history for the rest of your life.”', 'While Trump has yet to release a formal budget, Petters remains optimistic that the new administration will be good for business. He is also hopeful the sequester will be lifted, as his company relies heavily on the orderly flow of work from one ship to the next. “Let’s get out of this kind of crazy method of government-by-algorithm,” he said. “And let’s get back to the process of creating budgets and establishing priorities and allocating resources to those priorities.” Congressional fight or not, workers like Cofer will be ready for action. “I know what it feels like to be on the other end of equipment built by American workers, so I’m very honored and proud to be a part of it,” he said.']"

Both companies were built on top of the open-source software Git, which was started by Linux creator Linus Torvalds as a way for software developers to share code and work together from disparate locations.', 'GitHub was founded in 2008. Four years later, it raised $100 million from Andreessen Horowitz, a mammoth round in those days. GitLab launched around the time of that financing.', 'In early 2015, after GitLab wrapped up its three-month stint in the Y Combinator accelerator program, CEO Sid Sijbrandij namechecked GitHub three times in his two-minute presentation at YC Demo Day.', '“Our competitor GitHub has 270 employees. GitLab has 800 contributors,” he said, touting his company’s open-source bona fides. “That is why GitHub enterprise has been playing catch-up to our feature set.”', 'GitHub had little reason to sweat at the time. GitLab only had $1 million in annualized revenue, and GitHub was not only backed by Andreessen but would soon pull in another $250 million in a round led by Sequoia.', 'However, GitHub’s cultural deficiencies had been exposed by an engineer named Julie Ann Horvath, who tweeted at length in 2014 about sexism in the upper ranks. Although the company continued expanding after some C-suite tweaks, GitLab suddenly had an opportunity to use its distinguishing culture to its advantage.', 'GitLab was founded as a fully remote company with no headquarters and not a single piece of real estate. All employees across the globe were said to have equal access to information. GitLab has an expansive online handbook, now consisting of over 2,000 web pages, that lays out in detail how the company operates, regarding everything from finance, engineering and marketing to hiring, stock options, compensation and remote work.', 'Board meetings were held at Sijbrandij’s apartment in San Francisco’s South of Market district.', '“We would all be sitting around his kitchen table, and he had a cat that would be in his bedroom meowing to come hang out,” said Dave Munichiello, a partner at GV who became a board observer after leading his company’s investment in 2017.', 'Eventually, the board fell in line with the rest of GitLab’s operations and went fully remote.', '“It was the last aspect of the company to go remote, and our board meetings are better for it,” Sijbrandij said in an interview on Thursday from the Nasdaq.', 'Munichiello said the cultural differences loomed large as he was evaluating the two Git-based rivals. So was the fact that GitLab had raised much less cash and had low operating costs.', '“We had just gone through this period of time where GitHub was lighting money on fire,” Munichiello said. In GitLab, “we saw a company that had a fantastic culture and understood that developers are the new kingmakers,” he added.', 'GitHub did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Then, in June 2018, Microsoft said it was buying GitHub for a whopping $7.5 billion. At roughly 25 times revenue, GitHub was richly priced for that time period, and the deal seemed to crown the market winner. GitLab’s most recent valuation from the year prior was just $200 million.', 'In fact, the game was just beginning.', 'GitLab excelled against its larger rival, despite Microsoft’s massive sales engine. It’s also thriving against BitBucket, its other main competitor, owned by Atlassian. In its fundraising announcement in September 2019, GitLab said annual revenue was up 143%. For the year that ended Jan. 31, revenue jumped 87%.', 'Public investors are now rewarding that momentum.', 'GitLab debuted on the Nasdaq on Thursday in one of the most-anticipated software IPOs of the year. After the stock’s 49% jump in its first tow days, GitLab is valued at almost $16.5 billion, more than double GitHub’s acquisition price from 2018. Its revenue multiple of 71 is one of the highest in all of software and is well above Atlassian’s multiple of 45.', '“The market loves fast growth,” said Tomasz Tunguz, a managing director at Redpoint Ventures who invests in software and infrastructure companies. His firm is not involved with GitLab.', 'Tunguz said that even with GitHub getting swallowed, GitLab showed the world of DevOps — the word refers to a combination of development and IT operations — doesn’t operate by the same rules as traditional software.', 'In DevOps, developers decide what tools they they use. With so many free and low-priced products available through a simple cloud delivery model, the software giants and their massive sales and marketing budgets don’t have all that much influence over their choices.', 'So GitLab built a suite of tools that developers want, in a package that businesses could buy.', '“GitLab had a sense of the importance of enterprise sales much earlier on in the lifespan of the company,” Tunguz said.', 'Microsoft’s acquisition of GitHub opened up two big opportunities for GitLab. First, GitLab could peel off developers who had an inherent mistrust of Microsoft and its anti-open-source past. Although current CEO Satya Nadella has made a point of embracing open-source offering where it makes sense for customers, Microsoft historically distanced itself from open source, with former CEO Steve Ballmer once calling Linux “a cancer.”', 'More importantly, GitLab could promote itself as a neutral service available across all public cloud providers, while GitHub would be owned by the same company that controls Azure, the second-largest cloud service after Amazon Web Services.', 'In a blog post titled, “Congratulations GitHub on the acquisition by Microsoft,” GitLab made exactly that point.', '“The long-term strategic implication seems to be that Microsoft wants to use GitHub as a means to drive Azure adoption,” the post said.', 'Sijbrandij said the market has played out as expected since the deal. For example, earlier this year GitHub launched a product called Codespaces as a cloud-based developer environment on Azure.', 'As for customers migrating over, Sijbrandij said UBS signed on last year, going from “zero to 11,000 people on GitLab,” even though the bank, like most big financial institutions, uses a lot of Microsoft products.', '“Our customers put great value on us being cloud-independent,” Sijbrandij said. “Every company is becoming multi-cloud.”', 'Sijbrandij added that Amazon and Google sell GitLab’s tools and those efforts “have been intensifying over the last few years.”', 'Still, GitLab has financial challenges. Even with no real estate costs and an expansive universe of unpaid developers helping build features, it’s running up big expenditures in sales and marketing as it tries to convert free users into paid customers, who shell out $19 a month or $99 a month for features like enhanced security and faster code reviews.', 'Revenue in the second quarter jumped 69% from a year earlier to $58.1 million, yet the company’s net loss widened in the period to $40.2 million from $9.4 million. Sales and marketing costs amounted to three-quarters of revenue in the second quarter.', 'Cumulative losses for the past four quarters exceeded $200 million. Prior to the IPO, GitLab had just $276.3 million of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet.', 'Unlike GitHub, which now operates within the cozy confines of cash-rich Microsoft, GitLab needs outside financing to maintain its growth. New Constructs, a research firm that takes a particularly skeptical view on tech IPO valuations, wrote in a report this week that GitLab should be valued as low as $770 million, or 95% below its current price.', '“As a cash generating machine, Microsoft can easily afford to offer GitHub services at or below cost in an effort to gain market share and bring users into the Microsoft platform,” the firm wrote. “GitLab’s dependence on one revenue stream, subscriptions and licenses to its DevOps platform, is a major competitive disadvantage as it attempts to compete with profitable companies that have many other revenue streams to support loss-leaders.”', 'GitLab acknowledges in its prospectus that, “our principal competitor is Microsoft Corporation following their acquisition of GitHub.”', 'Sijbrandij certainly isn’t expressing concern now that his company has hundreds of millions in additional capital to fuel expansion and, for the first time, a liquid stock that can be used to acquire smaller businesses.', 'He touts the benefit of GitLab’s full DevOps platform and the ability for developers to use it as their central repository throughout a project.', '“We’ve been able to build something that lets you do everything, from planning what you’re going to make, making it, deploying it all the way to monitoring it,” Sijbrandij said.', 'He says the contrast with GitLab isn’t all that different than it was six years ago, when he was just coming out of Y Combinator. GitHub hosts a lot of open-source projects, but the products its ships are closed and proprietary, Sijbrandij said, while GitLab uses a so-called open-core model, commercializing software that’s open source.', 'Hearkening back to GitLab’s early funding rounds, Sijbrandij wouldn’t specifically confirm that his intention was to grab some of the spotlight during GitHub’s developer conferences. But he didn’t deny it either.', '“When you start off as a company,” he said, “it’s really important you find a way to be part of the news cycle.”', 'WATCH: GitLab goes public on Nasdaq']"

But the country relies heavily on imports to meet its domestic demand for those commodities.', 'One way the country is diversifying its import sources is by buying stakes in overseas companies, said Verisk Maplecroft. Doing that will increase the proportion of Chinese-owned resources in the country’s total imports, the report said.', 'As an example, the consultancy said the number of Chinese-owned base metals and gold companies in Oceania rose from zero in the year 2000 to 59 last year. It represented around 22.6% of total foreign ownership in such companies, the report showed.', 'Oceania is a region that includes Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Fiji and numerous island nations.', '“China is seeking to strengthen its control over global supply chains via overseas investments and partnerships with international majors. Beijing has been supporting Chinese SOEs [state-owned enterprises] to ‘go global’ and establish control of resource bases overseas since the late 1990s,” said the report.', 'China imports critical commodities such as crude oil, natural gas, metallurgical coal and iron ore from a “highly concentrated” group of trading partners, said Verisk Maplecroft.', 'In diversifying its import sources, China prefers suppliers from “stable autocratic regimes” to democracies that may involve frequent changes in governments or potential shifts in policy, it added.', '“Our data shows China is pivoting towards more autocratic regimes that represent greater stability for its supply lines than democracies that are, or may become, hostile to Beijing. But it is also using its massive market as a source of diplomatic leverage,” the consultancy said.', '“By securing diversified sources, China will be in a better position to weaponise trade with geopolitical rivals, while at the same time increasing the economic dependence of new and existing partners,” it said.', 'But democratic countries dominate the production of some resources — one of them is iron ore.', 'China’s largest supplier of iron ore last year was Australia, an American ally that was recently hit by Beijing’s trade restrictions.', 'Australia shipped a monthly average of 60.86 million tonnes of iron ore to China in 2020, accounting for more than 60% of overall Chinese imports of the commodity, Refinitiv data showed.', 'That’s why China has been strengthening trade ties with other iron ore producers such as Brazil and Guinea, according to the Verisk Maplecroft report.', '“Despite a tougher line on Beijing under President Bolsonaro, Brazil remains a priority in China’s diversification strategy, while Guinea is politically well disposed to Beijing amid democratic backslide,” the report said.', 'China is by far Australia’s largest trading partner in goods and services, accounting for 39.4% of goods exports and 17.6% of services exports between 2019 and 2020, research firm Capital Economics said.', 'Beijing has shown that it’s willing to use trade as a geopolitical lever, according to the Verisk Maplecroft report.', 'The report cited the example of China banning Australian coal. Relations between the two countries soured after Australia supported a call for an international inquiry into China’s handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, which first emerged in the city of Wuhan.', 'Coal was just one of the Australian exports hit by Chinese retaliatory measures that ranged from tariffs to bans and restrictions.', 'Such geopolitical tensions could persist as China speeds up its effort to reduce its reliance on “unfriendly” resource suppliers, said Verisk Maplecroft.', '“Banning imports of coal from Australia was a prime example but more are likely to follow, with significant impacts on the trade in global commodities and the geopolitical landscape likely,” it said.', '“Companies and investors are in the direct sights of Beijing’s diplomatic moves and will need to prepare accordingly.”']"

The ship’s catapult has yet to launch an actual aircraft at sea and the vessel has only had helicopters land on its deck. ', 'Although it has yet to be put to the test, some already say the USS Gerald R. Ford is an example of the Navy’s costly and risky bet on “immature” technology.', 'Experts say the Navy’s decision to roll out some untested technologies in its next-generation classes of ships has been a costly lesson. For example, the new Ford aircraft carrier going into the Navy fleet cost nearly $13 billion, or around $2.4 billion above plan.', 'Proud day for @USNavy and nation as we commission #USSGeraldRFord (CVN 78) - new capabilities Ford brings will transform naval warfare', 'The Navy “made a significant bet on the newest and latest cutting-edge technology, and it bet that all of those technologies would mature as these platforms were scheduled to come online,” said Jerry Hendrix, senior fellow and director of the Defense Strategies and Assessments Program at the Center for a New American Security, a non-partisan Washington think tank.', 'Hendrix added, “Unfortunately some of those technologies did not mature. Hence, we’re seeing some delays in some critical programs, including the new Ford-Class carrier.”', 'Although years behind schedule, the Ford carrier was formally commissioned into the Navy’s fleet Saturday in a ceremony in Virginia, which was attended by President Donald Trump. The president had previously visited the carrier in March.', 'In remarks Saturday, Trump called the Ford carrier “the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier in the history of this world.” ', 'When building the new Ford carrier, the Navy ditched the steam-powered catapult system found on the older Nimitz-Class carriers and went instead with a electro-magnetic aircraft launch system. Similarly, the Navy went with an updated arresting gear to catch planes landing on the ship’s deck.', 'The Ford is the first new design of an aircraft carrier in 40 years. Last month, acting Navy Secretary Sean Stackley  conceded costs of the carriers were tough to swallow, but insisted the service (and shipbuilding industry) planned to learn from past missteps. Meanwhile, the maker of the new digital catapult, General Atomics, claims on its webpage the system’s benefits include a “reduced manning and life-cycle cost.”', 'The technology replaced the battle-tested steam catapult that had been used for decades to launch planes. As it turns out, though, the commander-in-chief is not at all a fan of the supercarrier’s technology. In a May interview, Trump told Time magazine in an interview that the new digital power system “costs hundreds of millions of dollars more money and it’s no good.” ', 'Similarly, the Navy has faced cost overruns and other problems with other new classes of warships, including internal electrical issues with the Zumwalt-class destroyer, and struggles with the controversial Littoral Combat Ship program.', 'Trump alluded to military costs and program delays in his remarks Saturday, but didn’t single out the Ford carrier.', '“We do not want cost overruns,” the president said. “We want the best equipment but we want it built ahead of schedule and we want it built under budget.”', 'Mandy Smithberger, director of the Straus Military Reform Project at the Project On Government Oversight, said some of the mistakes made by the Navy on big-ticket programs have been self-inflicted. The service’s tendency to “develop really complex technology that’s expensive to maintain and not reliable,” has been a major drawback.', 'Added Smithberger, “It’s not necessarily that it’s new technology but it’s immature — so it has to be proven technology.”  ', 'Some analysts said the new ideas for the next-generation ships originated in the 1990s, when there was a “go for broke” mindset by some decision makers.', 'In the case of the Ford-Class carrier, the Navy decided to make all of the key changes in new technology upfront on the first ship in the class, rather than wait for successive carriers. The Navy plans to spend around $43 billion on the first three Ford-Class aircraft carriers.', 'At the same time, the Navy and other services have faced fiscal challenges due to the ongoing effect of the budget caps signed into law six years ago.', '“The Budget Control Act, as far as it pertains to defense, was wrong-minded and that should not have been systematically reducing defense spending,” said Brian Slattery, a policy analyst for national security at Washington-based Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.', 'He also said the inability of Congress to pass regular budgets is “very disruptive” to Navy and other service programs.', 'For the Navy, though, the budget situation is particularly pressing because of Trump’s stated goal for a larger Navy fleet.', 'As a GOP candidate last year, Trump pledged the Navy would build 350 surface ships and submarines. He has since accepted the Navy’s new force structure goal of a fleet of 355 ships — up from the battle force of 276 ships as of Friday.', 'However, reaching the Navy goal could cost approximately $400 billion more over 30 years than the service’s previously stated force goal of 308 ships, according to the Congressional Budget Office. ', 'Based on CBO’s calculations, the Navy would need to buy around 329 new ships over 30 years to reach the 355-ship fleet. That compares with the 254 ships it estimates would be bought under the Navy’s prior force goal.', '“Cost is probably the biggest challenge reaching the larger fleet size,” said Smithberger. “You’d have to increase Pentagon spending a lot to afford everything that they’re trying to buy. It will require cutting other services or other Navy priorities, including airplanes.”', 'Yet the time it will take to reach a 355-ship Navy also is a concern, given signs the Chinese are aggressively ramping up their own naval forces. Separately, Russia is undergoing a modernization plans of its own, including adding advanced nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines to its fleet.', '“The Chinese are coming hard, meaning they are going for mass numbers and new advanced technology,” said Hendrix, of the Center for a New American Security.', '“The Russians have made decisions to invest in fairly exquisite platforms, like the new Yasen-Class submarine, a nuclear powered, fast-attack boat which is very advanced,” he added. “And if they got two or three of those loose in the Atlantic, and we didn’t know where they were, it would cause real complications for the United States as well as NATO.”', 'In April, the nonpartisan CBO estimated the earliest the Navy could reach the 355-ship goal was by 2035, though it cautioned that 15-year buildup forecast was based on the service getting “sufficient funding.” The CBO also estimates the cost to build, crew and operate the larger fleet would average $102 billion annually through 2047. ', 'Regardless, Hendrix suggests there is perhaps a faster way to reach the 355-ship fleet size but not necessarily by adding newly constructed ships. Instead, he suggests the Navy might want to consider taking ships out of mothballs and keeping others in service longer to maintain the 355-ship fleet.', 'Others are not so sure it makes sense to keep ships in the fleet longer than they are scheduled. ', '“You can’t just run the same ships well beyond their service lives to assume that you can keep up the same level of capability to deter our adversaries,” said Slattery.', 'Hendrix said another option to increase the size of the Navy fleet is to look at some vessels in the so-called Ready Reserve Force ships, which are maintained for national defense and emergencies.', 'Either way, he believes there’s an urgent need to reach that 355-ship target sooner rather than later. The retired Navy captain insisted the Navy should strive to reach the 355-ship fleet “within a decade in order to deter both the Chinese and Russians who are looking to challenge us at sea.”']"

The deck is clear of handrails and ladders. Below deck, computers and neatly layered cables take the place of mess areas, heads and a galley.', '“Everything has to be completely automated and redundant because there is nobody on board to fix it,” said Dan Brintzinghoffer, vice president of maritime business development at Leidos, as we stood on top of the deck.', 'Dreyfus explained that Sea Hunter II’s design is expected to shave 25% to 30% off the life-cycle cost over a 10-year period.', '“The advantage of composites is that you can make more complex shapes in a less expensive way than if you were welding and bending steel,” he said tapping the opalescent composite hull.', 'In 2017, the Navy awarded Leidos a $35.5 million contract to build Sea Hunter II. With another drone ship on the way, it remains to be seen what missions the Navy has envisioned for the vessels.', '“They may carry weapons one day, that’s a choice the Navy will have to make, their value is out there and being widely distributed in large numbers, they have to go off by themselves and in harsh, unpredicted environments, they have to sense and make decisions,” Rear Adm. Nevin Carr, vice president and U.S. Navy senior account executive at Leidos, told CNBC.', '“The point is, they really function more like satellites, than ships,” Carr said, adding that the autonomous platforms would not replace naval vessels but collaborate with them.', 'The concept for the unmanned vessel was born in 2010 out of the Pentagon’s so-called mad science wing, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA.', 'The Pentagon’s request from DARPA was colossal: Develop a drone warship capable of hunting submarines, detecting torpedoes and avoiding objects at sea while traveling at a top speed of 27 knots, or 31 mph.', 'Six years later, the crewless, 140-ton, 132-foot-long robotic ship was christened as Sea Hunter on the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon.', 'On hand for the ship’s 2016 christening was then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work, who referred to the vessel’s narrow bow as a “Klingon Bird of Prey” from the “Star Trek” series.', '“This will operate wherever the United States Navy operates,” Work told a group of reporters after the ceremony. “It can operate in the South China Sea. It can operate in the Baltic Sea. It can operate in the Persian Gulf. And it can operate in the middle of the Atlantic or the middle of the Pacific.”', '“These will be everywhere,” he added.', 'After its unveiling in 2016, Sea Hunter was transferred to the Navy for testing off the coast of California. Two years later, Sea Hunter became the first ship to successfully navigate autonomously from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and back without crew onboard.', '“Right now, the Navy is looking at different payloads they can put on it, how easy is it to integrate things and thinking of, what’s next, what are the options for missions,” Donnelly Bohan, vice president and division manager of maritime systems at Leidos, told CNBC.']"

New York produces more hydroelectric power than any other state east of the Rocky Mountains, and it counts its nuclear power plants toward its 100% carbon-free electricity goal. Meanwhile, Texas’ share of renewables is growing over time, with 20% of its power coming from wind as of 2019.

', '“A majority of the new equipment manufactured from May 2020 through December 2020 was shipped to the U.S. and Canada,” he said.', 'Alex Brammer of Luxor Mining, a cryptocurrency pool built for advanced miners, points out that maturing capital markets and financial instruments around the mining industry also played a big role in the industry’s quick ascent in the U.S. Brammer says many of these American operators were able to start rapidly expanding once they secured financing by leveraging a multi-year track record of profitability and existing capital as collateral.', 'Covid also played a role.', 'Though the global pandemic shut down large swaths of the economy, the ensuing stimulus payments proved a boon for U.S. mining companies.', '“All the money printing during the pandemic meant that more capital needed to be deployed,” explained bitcoin mining engineer Brandon Arvanaghi. ', '“People were looking for places to park their cash. The appetite for large-scale investments had never been bigger. A lot of that likely found its way into bitcoin mining operations in places outside of China,” continued Arvanaghi.', 'Not all miners, however, are headed to renewable destinations.', 'Kazakhstan is just behind the U.S. in terms of its share of the global bitcoin mining market, with 18.1% of all crypto mining. It’s home to coal mines that provide a cheap and abundant supply of energy — but also ample carbon dioxide emissions.', 'However, several mining experts tell CNBC they think that Kazakhstan, which neighbors China, is just a temporary stopover on a longer migration west.', 'Brammer sees large miners going there in the short-term with older-generation equipment. “But as older-generation machines reach the end of their service lives, those companies will likely deploy new machines into more stable and energy efficient and renewable jurisdictions,” he said.', 'Also likely to put a damper on Kazakhstan’s popularity is a law newly signed by the president that will introduce extra taxes for crypto miners starting in 2022.', '“This will significantly change the incentives for people to deploy capital in Kazakhstan,” said Brammer.']"

Meanwhile, UPS is exploring new technologies, such as drones and self-driving trucks, to modernize its delivery services.', 'The moves come as Amazon is building up its delivery fleet, renting planes and offering $10,000 to its employees to leave the company and start their own local delivery business.', '“I think they have stated that they are now a competitor to the transport industry,” said Ken Hoexter, a research analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “And FedEx has clearly viewed them now in their recent moves as an increasing competitor.”', 'Just as some retail companies are uneasy about working with Amazon, which can be both a partner and a competitor, transportation companies are facing a similar dilemma. And with their customers facing off against Amazon in other industries, shipping companies may need to take sides.', 'Dan Neiweem, co-founder and principal of digital services and solutions provider Avionos, said that by ditching Amazon, FedEx may make itself more attractive to Amazon’s competitors in the retail space.', 'He compared it to reports that WalMart is pressuring some of its partners to use Microsoft’s Azure for cloud computing instead of Amazon Web Services. WalMart said “there are a small number of cases involving our most sensitive sales data that we’d prefer not sit on a competitor’s platform” but its vendors can choose the cloud service they prefer.', '“I think that what you’ll see is that a lot of the shipments that Amazon was going into the USPS and FedEx with are now going to be transitioned from other retailers who are saying ‘hey I don’t anybody in my space who works with Amazon,’” Neiweem said. “And you see that parallel very, very tightly with AWS and Azure.”', 'FedEx never relied on Amazon for a huge portion of its business. In a June statement announcing that Amazon would no longer be served by FedEx Express, the shipping company said Amazon accounted for 1.3% of its total revenues in 2018, or roughly $900 million.', 'From that perspective, FedEx’s decision to cut ties with Amazon makes sense, Hoexter said.', '“When you go to their sort centers, you can see that Walmart and Jet are a major customer of FedEx’s, so certainly that relationship is as important if not more important than Amazon,” Hoexter said.', '“So if you have to choose one, if UPS is larger with Amazon and you’re larger with Walmart, you’re going to kind of work closer with that candidate.”', 'Throughout its rise, Amazon has relied on UPS for a large portion of its shipping needs. UPS is still more exposed to Amazon than FedEx was. David Ross, transportation research analyst at Stifel, said he estimates that UPS gets between 7% and 9% of its total revenue from Amazon.', '“If you go back 10, 15 years UPS was the chosen parcel carrier by Amazon, and when they started their prime two-day offering it was a lot of UPS,” Ross said.', 'Amazon started using the U.S. Postal Service more after the delivery companies struggled to deliver packages on time during the 2013 holiday season, Ross said.', 'Online shopping has continued to grow since then. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce has grown from roughly 4% of total retails sales in 2010 to more than 10% earlier this year. FedEx said it expects e-commerce to grow to 100 million packages per day in the U.S. by 2026.', 'As e-commerce has boomed, Amazon has struck out more on its own and built a sizable delivery network. The tech giant may not be delivering many third-party packages right now, but Neiweem said that’s “sort of the last stand or threshold that they haven’t crossed yet.”', 'UPS and FedEx are also investing in their businesses, with both companies expanding delivery to 7 days per week.', 'FedEx, which said it has “a strong relationship with retailers of all sizes,” has started offering retailers extended hours for package pickup, partners with stores such as Dollar General to create customer pick up areas and is experimenting with a delivery robot.', 'UPS, which saw demand for next day air shipping increase 30% in the second quarter, has invested in TuSimple, an autonomous shipping business, and is forming a drone subsidiary called UPS Flight Forward. The company is also expanding its air fleet and is scheduled to add 11 cargo planes this year.', 'The growing demand for fast shipping has weighed on the financial results for large shipping companies. More home deliveries means shipping companies make less per stop than if they delivered a lot of packages to one spot, like a convenience store.', 'Hoexter said that domestic margins at UPS have been under pressure for the past several years, and that is where analysts will look to see if its new investments and increased leverage with Amazon are working.', '“As we get into peak season, have they found a way to stabilize those margins despite the growth of e-commerce? That’s going to be the key for the stock. When you ask what do we look for its the margin side and pricing if we start to see that improving or stabilizing. That’s the first step,” Hoexter said.', 'With FedEx now out of the picture, UPS may also be able to gain some short-term leverage on pricing, Hoexter said. That opportunity may not last for long, as Amazon continues to expand its own delivery network and expects to have 70 planes in its fleet by 2021.', 'For FedEx, the separation means the company can show that its e-commerce success is not tied to Amazon.', '“FedEx is just showing people that they don’t need Amazon to be a good business, and they feel that they can continue to grow without Amazon. I think they wanted to just distance themselves from Amazon in a way that made their own growth story a little more clear to people,” Ross said.']"

Back in 2008, for example, a fuel cell ship capable of carrying passengers entered into service on a lake in Hamburg, Germany.', 'In March of this year Linde, a firm specializing in engineering and industrial gases, said it had been chosen by Norwegian firm Norled to provide liquid hydrogen and associated infrastructure for a hydrogen-powered ferry. The MF Hydra, as it’s known, will be able to carry both passengers and cars.', 'In a statement at the time Norled’s CEO, Heidi Wolden, said the firm believed hydrogen would “play a significant role in the future of zero-emission ships.”', 'Described by the International Energy Agency as a “versatile energy carrier,” hydrogen has a diverse range of applications and can be deployed in sectors such as industry and transport.', 'Ferries are not the only mode of transportation where hydrogen fuel cells could have a role to play.', 'Hydrogen buses have been used in cities such as London and Aberdeen, for example, while hydrogen fuel cell airplanes have also taken flight in recent years.', 'Major automobile manufacturers that have dipped into the hydrogen fuel cell market include Toyota and Honda, while smaller firms such as Riversimple are also working on hydrogen powered cars.']"

Some, like a new version of last year’s Fire TV Cube, are made by Amazon. And several third-party manufacturers announced their own living room devices running Amazon’s services.', 'At the CES 2019 trade show, Amazon began to demonstrate how it’s working with other companies to put Alexa into other smart devices, and now it’s showing it can do the same with its Fire TV software as it expands partnerships to companies who will build and sell Fire TV devices in Germany, Austria and the United Kingdom.', 'The new version of the Fire TV Cube is up to two times faster than last year’s model. The first Fire TV Cube launched last July. Like its predecessor, the new model lets you control your TV, cable box and other inputs using just your voice. That means you can walk into the room and say “Alexa, tune to ESPN on cable” and the Fire TV Cube will pull up ESPN on cable TV. It also works with streaming services like Hulu, Netflix, Sling TV and more.', 'The new Fire TV Cube’s performance boost is thanks to a new processor, which should help cut down on lag when moving between apps. It also now locally processes basic Alexa requests for things like increasing the volume or returning to the home screen, instead of sending those requests to the cloud first. That should make those responses up to four times faster, Amazon says. The design is the same as last year’s model.', '“The design is the same because it’s worked well in terms of microphone array and layout,” Amazon’s vice president of product development for Fire TV Sandeep Gupta told CNBC, referring to the box’s ability to listen to voice commands. “Local voice control has a subset of commands that are critical and cut out the cloud part so if we recognize [a command] it can just execute it immediately,” he said.', 'Gupta told CNBC that Amazon has found Fire TV Cube owners are much more likely to interact using voice than other Fire TV product owners.', '“We get eight times the usage of voice than we do in other devices,” he said. “We see almost 80% of Fire TV Cube users using it for device automation and smart home devices,” he said.', 'The new Fire TV Cube costs $119.99 in the U.S., the same price as the original model. Pre-orders open on Wednesday in the U.S. and, for the first time, in Germany, the United Kingdom and Japan. It will ship on Oct. 10 in the U.S., United Kingdom and Germany and on Nov. 5 in Japan.', 'Amazon also announced a slew of products with Fire TV software and Amazon Alexa built-in, which will be sold by its partners.', 'That includes Anker’s new Nebula soundbar, which has support for Fire TV built-in so you don’t need a separate device to stream video. Like the Fire TV Cube, it includes voice support, so you can ask Alexa to control your device. It sounds a lot like a similar product announced by Roku Wednesday morning. The Nebula Soundbar from Anker will cost $229.99 in the U.S. and ships Nov. 21, but customers can pre-order it now. It will also be available in Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany.', 'Amazon also said that it is partnering with Dixons Carphone, MediaMarktSaturn’s IMTRON and Grundig, which will all begin to sell new Fire TV Edition smart TVs. Prior to Wednesday, Amazon sold Fire TV Edition televisions with Toshiba and Best Buy’s Insignia brand in the U.S.', 'IMTRON’s Fire TV Edition smart TVs will be sold under the private label brand “ok” in Germany and Austria. Grundig will sell a total of 11 models including two OLED model TVs under the “Fire OLED TV - Fire TV Edition Hands-Free with Alexa” branding and two without hands-free support. Hands-free offers Alexa for voice controls without the need for a remote. It will also sell the Grundig Vision 7 with 4K Ultra HD and Vision 6 TVs with 1080p support. Those will also be sold in Germany and Austria. Pricing and release will vary by model and size.', 'Finally, Amazon is partnering with Dixon’s Carphone and JVC to sell JVC Fire TV Edition Smart Ultra HD HDR LED TVs in the United Kingdom in 40-inch, 49-inch and 55-inch screen sizes. They will ship with a voice remote that includes Alexa for controlling the TV, but they don’t have microphones built-in like the Fire TV Cube or the sets from Grundig.', 'Follow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech product news.']"

I’ve had aunts and uncles, and everybody retire” from GM, he said, adding “I know that they would be proud of the moment.”', 'Cole’s great-grandfather, Roy Caudell, worked as a supervisor for Delco-Remy, once a division of GM in Anderson, Indiana, which  built parts during WWII used for aircrafts and tanks, among other wartime equipment. ', 'For weeks, Cole, 42, has been working tirelessly to begin producing critical care ventilators for the U.S. at a closed engineering facility in Kokomo, Indiana. He worked on streamlining production of the devices, specifically the metering valve, which is part of the ventilator that regulates how the patient receives oxygen.', 'About 240 salaried employees outside of GM’s Kokomo operations assisted in producing the ventilators with Ventec, according to the automaker. ', '“It’s a life-saving measure and our motto here is ‘moments matter,’” Cole said. “I knew I could contribute to the cause and hopefully save lives across the country and across the world.”', 'GM started producing and shipping the ventilators last week. At the direction of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the first devices were delivered Friday to two Illinois hospitals. GM says 550 United Auto Workers members are producing ventilators on one shift of eight to 10 hours, seven days a week. A second shift is expected to begin this week at the facility.', 'The 180,000 square-foot building is one of several in GM’s Kokomo components complex, which has gone from thousands of workers to hundreds today.', 'Patty Waltman, a UAW worker at GM’s Kokomo complex who was laid off in January, said the work is rewarding as well as needed.', '“This was my last hope to have a job if I wanted to stay with GM, so I was excited to come back and be a part of this,” she said. “To save lives, I think that’s just the icing on the cake to be able to do that.”', 'Waltman, 62, was a team leader for circuit boards for engine control modules for various vehicles. She’s now doing electrical work on the ventilator.', '“It’s really great to be able to see this ventilator and how it actually functions,” she said. “To see all the process, to see all the detail that goes into it, It’s pretty phenomenal.” ', 'Waltman hopes the temporary work turns into permanent jobs: “This is just huge for us to be able to be a part of it,” she said. “We just hope it expands into something even greater.”', 'GM trained the workers, sourced needed materials and updated the three-story facility in under 11 days. While frustrating at times due to the rapidness of the launch, Cole described it as packing “25 pounds into a 5 pound sac to get it done so quickly.”', 'GM expects to hire 1,000 UAW members, many of whom have been laid off from the Kokomo operations, for the ventilator work. The automaker signed a deal to build 30,000 ventilators for the national stockpile for $489.4 million under the Defense Production Act, which was invoked last month by President Donald Trump.', 'The order is expected to be fulfilled by the end of August, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. A third shift producing ventilators is expected to begin by June, GM said.', 'GM CEO and Chairman Mary Barra said the work that went into producing the ventilators is one of the “proudest moments” of her nearly 40-year career with the automaker.', '“When I look here and I see all of you here today, volunteering to be here, volunteering to be a part of something that is truly, truly life-saving, it is just overwhelming,” she said in a video released by the automaker.  “I want to thank you all for everything that you’re doing and you’re going to do.”', 'Barra video tweet', 'Barra toured the facility Tuesday with GM President Mark Reuss and other GM and Ventec executives, including Chris Kiple, CEO of the Washington-based medical device company.', '“From the very first phone call we had with the General Motors team, it very quickly turned into action,” he said. “Literally within minutes we were solving problems together.

All of these supplies are being donated.', 'Other automakers also are providing vehicles or services to those on the frontline combating the disease. For example, Mazda announced Wednesday that it will provide free standard oil changes and enhanced cleaning services for U.S. healthcare workers at participating dealers nationwide. They do not need to own a Mazda.', 'Volkswagen last week announced a program that will pay its more than 600 franchised U.S. dealers to put their service loaner fleet to use for free pickup and delivery of needed supplies and food.

Sometimes the sound suddenly played when another user sent a message, and sometimes he heard it in the background while talking with people on Zoom video calls.', '“It’s really intense,” said Moore, who has created sounds for products at Amazon, Google and Uber. He turned off the notification sound. And then he reached out to Slack. He wants to help the world sound better, he said, and he recognized an opportunity.', 'That’s probably a good idea, because Slack’s scratch-pop-pop-pop sound is one of the noises that people have been hearing a lot more lately.', 'In recent years, companies have been investing in sound to make their software and stand out. Combine that trend with increased computer usage during the pandemic, and suddenly a lot of us are noticing the sounds we used to ignore.', 'It’s not just Slack, which saw a wave of new users last year as the coronavirus hit U.S. shores and offices closed, causing companies to lean on virtual ways for workers to stay in touch. Microsoft’s Teams chat app chirps to notify users of new messages, while its Outlook client rings out about new emails and upcoming calendar events — and the number of meetings and emails has climbed during the pandemic, according to a study Microsoft conducted. The average Teams user is sending 45% more chat messages per week compared with the pre-Covid age.', 'Apple and Google’s calendar apps make sounds about events happening imminently. Apple, Discord, Facebook and Microsoft’s LinkedIn all signal the arrival of instant messages with their own custom sounds. Websites are generating their own sounds in some cases, too.', 'All of the noise can get to be a bit much.', '“I do think the general public doesn’t have knowledge of how unhealthy constant notifications are,” said Dallas Taylor, host of Twenty Thousand Hertz, a podcast that tells the stories of distinctive sounds. “Our technology should work for us and not make us feel like we’re slaves to technology.”', 'Your phone doesn’t need to go off every time you get an email from a home-goods retailer that you never signed up to receive in the first place, Taylor said. Only one app on his phone is allowed to send notifications and make sounds, and that’s Slack.', 'Sound design is the process of recording or synthesizing audio to fit the needs of a moment in a creative work, such as a commercial, movie or video game. It dates at least back to the 1970s, when film editor Walter Murch was credited as a sound designer for his contributions to “Apocalypse Now.”', 'In the 1990s, sounds came to Microsoft Windows and the Apple Macintosh operating systems on personal computers. AOL’s Instant Messenger program made noise whenever users received new messages and friends came online.', 'More sounds came in the 2000s when Apple’s iPhone arrived. The smartphone emitted a sound every time a user unlocked the screen or took a photo.', 'That’s when the world’s largest tech companies began hiring sound designers.', 'Microsoft hired its first in-house sound designers, Conor O’Sullivan and Matthew Bennett, in 2009. Before that, the company had leaned on people who split sound design with other duties, such as Steve Ball, a principal program manager lead who worked on other operating system components, and product designer Benjamin Bethurum, who developed sounds such as ringtones for Windows Mobile phones and other products.', 'Amazon’s sound-design efforts ramped up with the 2014 launch of the Alexa assistant and Echo smart speaker according to Chris Seifert, principal user experience sound designer at the company.', 'In 2015 O’Sullivan left Microsoft and joined Google to be its head of sound design. Google has “a handful” of sound designers today, he said.', 'Smaller companies’ websites have also started making sounds. Companies such as Drift and Intercom provide a means to add a chat window to the bottom of a web page where visitors can get answers to any questions they have. A widget like this will set off a chime to capture attention.', 'In 2014, Facebook hired Will Littlejohn, who had worked on sounds for Jawbone’s Jambox speakers and music in the Guitar Hero games, to be its sound design lead. Before that, Facebook had one sound, said Littlejohn. He and others at a firm he had co-founded came up with a series of sounds for the Messenger app, and Facebook asked if he would be willing to build the discipline of sound design at the company. Now there are more than 10 people on his team.', 'The team created different sounds for incoming messages on Messenger based on the device the recipient was using. Historically phones have had a limited frequency range than more powerful PCs. That’s why Facebook’s Messenger app makes a high-pitched “pop-ding” sound for an incoming message on a smartphone and a lower-pitched “pop-om” sound on a PC.', 'The sounds have a job to do — convey that a new Facebook message has arrived — but they’re more than just alerts. Facebook also wants them to build an association in people’s brains. If you like using Messenger and you repeatedly hear its audible elements, “you’ll carry that with you in your life as a positive part of your experience,” said Littlejohn.', 'Sound designers come up with their beeps and bloops using musical instruments, synthesizers, software or even with the human voice. Google and Microsoft have silent anechoic chambers on their corporate campuses that sound designers can use.', 'Some also record audio out in the real world.', '“Almost every sound designer I know carries some type of miniature recorder no bigger than a phone, what are called field recorders,” Littlejohn said. “We record source all the time. These become things that we then can manifest in our products.”', 'At Google, building a prototype for a sound can take as little as two days, but conceiving of a sound that will reach billions of people might take months, O’Sullivan said. A sound designer might go through 100 cycles of listening to a sound in progress and making changes to it, including at different times of the day. If a sound is meant to break through the noise in a loud environment, then that’s part of the testing, too.', 'If Facebook is building a sound for smartphones, then sound designers will play back the sound on phones, rather than through comfortable headphones or powerful speakers, or even the tinny speakers on their laptops.', '“I won’t be listening to it specifically on speakers because that’s not the medium through which it will be experienced,” said Littlejohn.', 'When Bennett was at Microsoft, he rejected 800 to 1,000 candidates before shipping a sound in a product such as Windows 10. “I’m sure I listened to every shipping sound at least a couple thousand times before it was officially released,” he wrote in an email. “If I could still love it after all that, I knew it would probably age well in the real world.”', 'Once a sound has been released, Microsoft seeks out customer feedback, which can lead to changes, said Colin Day, a principal creative director at the company. Some people said they didn’t know they had received new direct messages in Teams, so in March 2020 the company updated that sound to make it more noticeable — but soon users said the sound was cutting through too much, Day said.', 'The coronavirus pandemic brought new attention to the sound of software.', 'During the online meetings we’ve been holding and the television interviews we’ve been watching, sounds from other people are spilling over into our ears. Sometimes, that’s by design.', 'Imagine that a start-up is trying to sell its software to a bank. People from both sides on a briefing call will hear the start-up CEO’s phone playing a melody every few minutes to signify that an email has come in. To the start-up’s salesperson on the call alongside the CEO, the sounds are nothing unusual. But the chief information officer from the bank might perceive that the start-up CEO has considerable inbound communication, and that could assure the person that the start-up’s wares are in demand.', '“It makes audible your network,” said Meredith Ward, director of film and media studies at Johns Hopkins University.', 'For Ward, reminders of events starting soon have become more important than ever. No longer is she seeing visual cues of what to do next because she’s no longer visiting different places on campus. Everything happens in front of a screen now, and sounds are the symbols of transition.', 'But the sounds can also blend together and become confusing. That can even apply to a single app, such as the communication app Discord. Users can participate in text and voice chats in a variety of groups, known as servers, and the “boop-beep” sound of a new message doesn’t tell them if it’s coming from a relative on one private server or a stranger in a server where thousands gather to discuss a game.', 'Sounds can also distract people, even for just a few seconds. As the pandemic continues, Day at Microsoft said he’s been thinking about the role that sound plays during meetings. “I want to be a really good active listener, and I want other people to practice that as well,” he said.', '“This happens to me personally quite a bit, where I’ll hear a sound and go, ‘What was that sound? I don’t even recognize that sound,’” said Greg Gordon, CEO of the San Francisco music-production institute Pyramind. “I have 20 to 30 tabs on my browser open, and I’m flipping between tabs. I know one of them gave me a notification, and I don’t remember which of them it was.”', 'Sounds that once seemed tolerable have become, for certain people, irritating.', 'To Bennett — Microsoft’s chief sound designer until earlier this year, when he struck out on his own — the sound that goes off when he received a text message on his iPhone began to grate on his ear, with what he said is a sharp attack and a long decay. He turned off the sound last year.', '“We’re probably hearing our messaging sounds, our IM sounds, a lot more,” he said. “I know there are days I’ve heard them all day long. You want to turn them off but if you step away, you’re missing something.”', 'Many product sounds now seem to go on too long for Bennett’s taste. A sound that plays for two and a half seconds, for example, might have worked well before the pandemic, when there were so many other sounds in the background. Now he wonders if it’s really necessary to hear the whole thing in order to grasp what it’s designed to convey.', 'Google has asked users about sounds and learned that some who kept their phones on silent when they worked at offices now have their sound on, so they don’t miss food deliveries or important messages from colleagues, O’Sullivan said. Some still prefer to keep audio notifications off, though. Jonathan Sterne, a professor of art history and communications studies at McGill University, said he likes listening to music while writing or grading and doesn’t want any other sounds coming out of his devices.', 'But sometimes the devices overrule his wishes. Earlier this year, he said, while teaching a class on Zoom, his Mac updated and its settings changed. The computer started making a sound with each text message that arrived. The sounds were loud, and he couldn’t immediately figure out how to disable them. “That was incredibly annoying,” he said.', 'Sound designers don’t want their work to be annoying. They need to make sure their sounds don’t reflect poorly on their employers.', '“There’s an aspect of sound design that is expressing the brand,” Google’s O’Sullivan said. People remember sounds and associate them with products.', 'Slack’s trademark sound is so distinctive, it’s become like a second logo.

The VSS Enterprise was destroyed in a fatal test flight accident in 2014, while the VSS Unity has flown two spaceflights, most recently in February 2019.

Colglazier said last month the company will need to build more to reach its targeted flight rates. He believes it’s likely Virgin Galactic could “find some great partnerships” among aerospace companies to build the next carrier aircraft, as opposed to the company building “its own dedicated mothership assembly factory.”', 'Moses said Virgin Galactic is addressing the electromagnetic interference issue that delayed the second attempt of its December spaceflight test to May.', '“You can never completely eliminate EMI — it’s an artifact of aerospace electrical systems — but we could really take the source of it down quite a bit and so that’s what the team has been busy doing,” Moses said.', 'Electromagnetic interference was the root cause of its December flight abort. Moses said Virgin Galactic has made changes to some of its “electronic components, as well as on the sensors that those components then read and use to tell what’s happening” on VSS Unity.', '“We’ve implemented both of those changes, we’ve tested them out on the ground. Now we’re installing them into the ship,” Moses said. “We’ll run a full end-to-end check on the ship and, assuming those results are good, we look like we’re still on track for that May target.”', 'Virgin Galactic went public through through a deal with Chamath Palihapitiya’s special purpose acquisition company in 2019.

When it comes to height, the U.S. Department of Energy says the towers of turbines “are becoming taller to capture more energy, since winds generally increase as altitudes increase.”', 'A bigger rotor diameter isn’t just for show either, with the DOE noting that they “allow wind turbines to sweep more area, capture more wind, and produce more electricity.”', 'It’s much the same with blades. The DOE says longer blades can “capture more of the available wind than shorter blades—even in areas with relatively less wind.”', 'Having huge turbines arrive on the market is all well and good, but their sheer scale may pose a number of mid-to-long term challenges for the sector, creating pinch points that could cause headaches.', 'Take installations. In February, research from Rystad Energy honed in on some of the possible issues related to the ships used to install offshore wind turbines out at sea.', 'Not counting China, it said wind turbines had seen what it called “a growth spurt in recent years, rising from an average of 3 megawatts (MW) in 2010 to 6.5 MW today.”', 'This shift, it explained, was likely to be sustained. “Turbines larger than 8 MW accounted for just 3% of global installations between 2010 and 2021, but that percentage is forecast to surge to 53% by 2030.”', 'The above data relates to offshore wind turbines only. According to the energy research and business intelligence firm, demand for vessels able to install larger offshore turbines is set to outstrip supply by the year 2024.', 'Operators, it said, “will have to invest in new vessels or upgrade existing ones to install the super-sized turbines that are expected to become the norm by the end of the decade, or the pace of offshore wind installations could slow down.”', '“When turbines were smaller, installation could be handled by the first-generation fleet of offshore wind vessels or converted jackups from the oil and gas industry,” Martin Lysne, senior analyst for rigs and vessels at Rystad Energy, said in a statement at the time.', 'With operators continuing to favor bigger turbines, Lysne said a “new generation of purpose-built vessels” would be needed to satisfy demand.', 'These specialized vessels don’t come cheap. U.S. firm Dominion Energy, for example, is heading up a consortium building the 472-foot Charybdis, which will cost around $500 million and be able to install current turbines and next-generation ones of 12 MW or greater. More vessels like the Charybdis will be needed in the future as turbines grow.', '“Out of the current fleet of purpose-built vessels, only a handful of units can install 10 MW+ turbines, and none are currently able to install 14 MW+ turbines,” according to Rystad Energy’s analysis. “This will change towards 2025 as newbuilds start to be delivered and existing vessels get crane upgrades.” ', 'The ships that transport and install turbines will be important in the years ahead, but the ports where they dock are another area where investment and upgrades will likely be needed to cater to wind energy’s growth.', 'In a comment sent to CNBC via email, Rystad Energy’s Lysne described port infrastructure as being “very important” from a vessel perspective.', 'Going forward, it would appear that a lot of money will be needed. Last May, a report from industry body WindEurope said Europe’s ports would have to invest 6.5 billion euros (around $7.07 billion) by 2030 in order “to support the expansion of offshore wind.”', 'The report addressed the new reality of bigger turbines and the effect this could have in relation to ports and infrastructure. “Upgraded or entirely new facilities are needed to host larger turbines and a larger market,” it said.', 'Ports, WindEurope said, would also need to “expand their land, reinforce quays, enhance their deep-sea harbours and carry out other civil works.”', 'More recently, a report from the Global Wind Energy Council also reinforced the importance of ports.', '“As offshore wind projects expand and commercial-scale floating wind projects proliferate, port upgrades will be critical for the future success of the industry,” it said.', 'The Brussels-based organization said turbine sizes had “increased dramatically” over the past decade, noting that 15 MW turbines were available on the market.', '“Experts now predict turbines with a 17 MW rating will be commonplace by 2035,” it said, before adding that projects centered around floating offshore wind were being developed “at huge volumes.”', 'These “floating projects” needed “significant quayside storage and assembly, necessitating more spacious facilities, on-land connective transport links within port areas and deeper-water ports.”', '“Several governments have identified port upgrades as vital to progressing offshore wind, from Taiwan to New York State.”', 'In relation to ports, Rystad Energy’s Lysne told CNBC that the U.S. — whose current offshore wind market is small — would “require more work as they do not have the same infrastructure in place as Europe.”', 'Change on that front does appear to be forthcoming. At the beginning of March, BP and Equinor — two businesses better known as oil and gas producers — signed an agreement to convert the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal into an offshore wind port.', 'In an announcement, Equinor said the port would become “a cutting-edge staging facility for Equinor and bp’s Empire Wind and Beacon Wind projects.” The site, it claimed, would be “a go-to destination for future offshore wind projects in the region.” Investment in infrastructure upgrades is expected to come in at $200 to $250 million.', 'All of the above feeds into the importance of infrastructure and logistics. Shashi Barla, who is global head of wind supply chain and technology at Wood Mackenzie, told CNBC that while companies had the technological capabilities, logistical challenges were proving to be “very difficult.”', '“It’s not that it is something new … we have been talking about logistics challenges since day one of the industry,” Barla said. “It’s that ... we are kind of now, today, approaching the tipping point.”', 'Around the world, major economies are announcing plans to ramp up wind energy capacity in a bid to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.', 'While these goals are ambitious, it’s clear they face a number of hurdles. Notwithstanding the issues related to turbine size, it will require a gargantuan effort to bring all these installations online. There’s work to be done.   ', '“Increasingly, a lack of facilitating infrastructure is seen as a major limiting factor in the wind industry’s growth,” the GWEC’s report noted.', '“In many countries,” it added, “lack of infrastructure, such as grid and transmission networks, logistics highways and ports, is curtailing the expansion of wind power and stifling the very innovation needed to transform the energy system.”', 'Alongside these issues, wind turbines’ interaction with wildlife is likely to be another area of major debate and discussion going forward.', 'Only last week, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that a firm called ESI Energy Inc had “pled guilty to three counts of violating the MBTA,” or Migratory Bird Treaty Act.', 'As the 21st century progresses, wind energy is set for a massive expansion, but the road ahead looks far from smooth. With the U.N. secretary-general recently warning the planet was “sleepwalking to climate catastrophe,” the stakes couldn’t be much higher.']"

It will cost $149 and begin shipping Nov. 5.', 'Perhaps the most interesting part of Portal TV is the social aspect. Once you’re connected, you can watch shows together on Facebook Watch or play augmented reality games. Facebook is also showing sensitivity to privacy concerns, giving users an easy way to cover the camera and turn off the microphones when not using the device.', 'While tech mega-cap peers Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft have experienced varying degrees of success with consumer devices, Facebook has failed to find much of a customer base. Last year, the company released the Portal and Portal+ video chat smart speakers powered by Amazon Alexa, but sales were minimal. Facebook said in July that second-quarter revenue in the payments and other fees segment, which includes Oculus virtual reality headsets and Portal devices, rose 36% to $262 million, accounting for less than 2% of total sales.', 'Selling the combination of a smart speaker and video-streaming product gets Facebook closer to an all-purpose streaming service as it goes up against stiff competition.

Amazon Flex uses on-demand contract drivers to help with this especially labor-intensive and expensive hand-delivery.', 'Flex was launched in 2015, and now operates in about 50 U.S. cities. Anyone over 21 with a driver’s license, auto insurance and at least a midsize sedan can sign up. After clearing a basic background check, drivers in areas with open spots can start picking up and delivering packages.', 'CNBC spent a day delivering with Flex driver Omar Montes in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he helped a friend deliver around 46 packages in 3½ hours, for $105.', '“These are like the good days that make you want to continue doing Amazon. But, you know, there’s obviously bad days too,” Montes said.', 'Last year, Amazon also brought on small-business partners and bought 20,000 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans for them to use for delivery. These two programs are part of Amazon’s larger move to grow its own logistics network, relying less on other carriers like UPS, the U.S. Postal Service, and FedEx — which just announced it wouldn’t renew its express U.S. contract with Amazon.', 'Amazon would not disclose how many drivers have signed up, or what percentage of its last-mile deliveries are made by Flex drivers compared with its shipping partners. But it did tell us the program is expanding.', '“We’ve built out these small-businesses delivery service providers and we have Flex which is our on-demand crowdsource delivery. So we need all of that to meet the various types of delivery we do in each of our geographies and I think you’re going to see expansion on all fronts there,” said Dave Clark, senior vice president of worldwide operations at Amazon.', 'Flex drivers use the Flex app to sign up for a “block” — which ranges from three to six hours — then head to a fulfillment center, where they find out how many boxes they’ve been assigned to deliver in that time frame. Amazon advertises that drivers make $18 to $25 an hour. Flex drivers are responsible for their own vehicle costs like gas, tolls and maintenance.', 'Depending on how long a block actually takes to deliver, drivers said the jobs are not always worthwhile.', '“If I spent three-hours-plus of my time, that’s just doing the block. Then who knows how long it will take me to get back. And all I made was 70 bucks, and half of that might go to expenses like gas and like the bridge,” Montes said.', 'But drivers in less-congested regions, including Arizona, Kentucky and New Jersey, told CNBC that they often finish deliveries early, making the pace relaxed and the hourly pay much higher, because you’re paid for the full block no matter how long it takes you.', '“You just might have just the one package in your three-hour block. That’s done in 20 minutes. So that’s rare but it happens, and it’s just a nice little thing to happen to folks driving,” said Quan Tsang, an Amazon Flex driver in Irvine, California.', 'Other drivers told CNBC they had safety concerns, from the Flex app encouraging distracted driving, to a lack of Amazon-branded clothing that leads to confrontations with confused customers.', 'Amazon told CNBC that “Safety is our number one priority. We communicate with delivery partners regarding safety topics, including safe loading practices. The vast majority of drivers complete their routes safely in less than the allotted time.”', '“Amazon provides delivery partners with 24/7 on road support,” the company said. “If delivery partners come across issues while making a delivery, we work with them directly on a resolution.', 'CNBC spoke to a total of 11 Flex drivers around the country to find out what it’s really like to deliver for Amazon, and how it compares to other gig jobs like driving for Uber, Lyft, Postmates or Doordash.

It is the second-biggest mining destination on the planet, accounting for nearly 17% of all the world’s bitcoin miners as of April 2021. That’s a 151% increase from September 2020. ', '“For the last 18 months, we’ve had a serious growth of mining infrastructure in the U.S.,” said Darin Feinstein, founder of Blockcap and Core Scientific. “We’ve noticed a massive uptick in mining operations looking to relocate to North America, mostly in the U.S.”', 'This dataset doesn’t include the mass mining exodus out of China, which led to half the world’s miners dropping offline, and experts tell CNBC that the U.S. share of the mining market is likely even bigger than the numbers indicate.', 'According to the newly-released Cambridge data, just before the Chinese mining ban began, the country accounted for 46% of the world’s total hashrate, an industry term used to describe the collective computing power of the bitcoin network. That’s a sharp decline from 75.5% in September 2019, and the percentage is likely much lower given the exodus underway now. ', '“500,000 formerly Chinese miner rigs are looking for homes in the U.S,” said Marathon Digital’s Fred Thiel. “If they are deployed, it would mean North America would have closer to 40% of global hashrate by the end of 2022.”', 'America’s rising dominance is a simple case of luck meeting preparation. The U.S. has quietly been building up its hosting capacity for years.', 'Before bitcoin miners actually started coming to America, companies across the country made a gamble that eventually, if adequate infrastructure were in place, they would set up shop in the U.S. ', 'That gamble appears to be paying off.', 'When bitcoin crashed in late 2017 and the wider market entered a multi-year crypto winter, there wasn’t much demand for big bitcoin farms. U.S. mining operators saw their opening and jumped at the chance to deploy cheap money to build up the mining ecosystem in the States. ', '“The large, publicly traded miners were able to raise capital to go make big purchases,” said Mike Colyer, CEO of digital currency company Foundry, which helped bring over $300 million of mining equipment into North America.', 'Companies like North American crypto mining operator Core Scientific kept building out hosting space all through the crypto winter, so that they had the capacity to plug in new gear, according to Colyer. ', '“A majority of the new equipment manufactured from May 2020 through December 2020 was shipped to the U.S. and Canada,” he said.', 'Alex Brammer of Luxor Mining, a cryptocurrency pool built for advanced miners, points out that maturing capital markets and financial instruments around the mining industry also played a big role in the industry’s quick ascent in the U.S. Brammer says that many of these American operators were able to start rapidly expanding once they secured financing by leveraging a multi-year track record of profitability and existing capital as collateral.', 'Covid also played a role.', 'Though the global pandemic shut down large swaths of the economy, the ensuing stimulus payments that proved a boon for U.S. mining companies.', '“All the money printing during the pandemic meant that more capital needed to be deployed,” explained bitcoin mining engineer Brandon Arvanaghi. ', '“People were looking for places to park their cash. The appetite for large-scale investments had never been bigger. A lot of that likely found its way into bitcoin mining operations in places outside of China,” continued Arvanaghi.', 'The seeds of the U.S. migration started back in early 2020, according to Colyer. Prior to Beijing’s sudden crackdown, China’s mining dominance had already begun to slip. ', 'Part of the appeal is that the U.S. ticks a lot of the boxes for these migrant miners.', '“If you’re looking to relocate hundreds of millions of dollars of miners out of China, you want to make sure you have geographic, political, and jurisdictional stability. You also want to make sure there are private property right protections for the assets that you are relocating,” said Feinstein.', 'It also helps that the U.S. is also home to some of the cheapest sources of energy on the planet, many of which tend to be renewable. Because miners at scale compete in a low-margin industry, where their only variable cost is typically energy, they are incentivized to migrate to the world’s cheapest sources of power.', 'Thiel expects most new miners relocating to North America to be powered by renewables, or gas that is offset by renewable energy credits.', 'While Castle Island Ventures founding partner, Nic Carter, points out that U.S. mining isn’t wholly renewable, he does say that miners here are much better about selecting renewables and buying offsets.

59,The Panama Canal is a wonder of the modern world – here’s how it plans to reduce shipping emissions ,2018-08-23T07:06:27+0000,"['Roughly 80 kilometers long, the Panama Canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. A wonder of modern engineering and design, 13,000 to 14,000 vessels pass through the canal each year.  By reducing the distance ships need to travel to reach their destination, the canal helps to reduce fuel consumption and, in turn, greenhouse gas emissions. During its lifetime, it has helped prevent the emission of around more than 700 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2).  The shipping industry has an impact on the environment. In 2012, international shipping was responsible for an estimated 796 million tons of CO2 emissions — around 2.2 percent of total global CO2 emissions that year, according to the International Maritime Organization.  “The original Panama Canal was built between 1904 and 1914, a 10-year effort,” Jorge L. Quijano, CEO of the Panama Canal Authority, told CNBC’s “Sustainable Energy.”  “We are basically a short cut between the Atlantic and Pacific and to do this we use locks — so you go up 85 to 87 feet in elevation. Then you cross the continental divide on the lake (Gatun Lake) and you come down to zero-level elevation, which is… the Atlantic Ocean.”  The impact of the canal on the shipping industry has been significant — so much so that a specific type of cargo ship, the Panamax, has been designed to fit its dimensions. “It’s basically a vessel that’s 106 foot wide and… 965 foot long,” Quijano said.  Between 2009 and 2016, an extensive construction project saw the canal undergo a significant expansion when a third lane was built. This allows a larger type of vessel, the Neopanamax, to pass through. At the end of July, the 4,000th Neopanamax vessel transited through the expanded canal.  “We’re now looking at a vessel size that can carry as much as three times the numbers of containers that you could carry on the old Panamax locks,” Quijano said.']"

Rick Holliday, a longtime Bay Area real estate developer, thinks one answer lies in an old shipyard in Vallejo, about 40 minutes northeast of San Francisco.', 'Here, in a football-field-sized warehouse where workers used to make submarines, Mr. Holliday recently opened Factory OS, a factory that manufactures homes. In one end go wood, pipes, tile, sinks and toilets; out another come individual apartments that can be trucked to a construction site and bolted together in months.', '“If we don’t build housing differently, then no one can have any housing,” Mr. Holliday said during a recent tour, as he passed assembly-line workstations and stacks of raw materials like windows, pipes and rolls of pink insulation.', 'More from the New York Times:California housing problems are spilling across its borders Rent control campaign in California is taken to the streetsThe great American single-family home problem  ', 'Almost a decade after the recession flattened the housing industry, causing waves of contractors to go bankrupt and laid-off construction workers to leave the business for other jobs, builders have yet to regain their previous form. Today the pace of new apartment and housing construction sits at a little over half the 2006 peak.', 'The United States needs new housing, but its building industry isn’t big enough to provide it. The number of residential construction workers is 23 percent lower than in 2006, while higher-skill trades like plumbers, carpenters and electricians are down close to 17 percent. With demand for housing high and the supply of workers short, builders are bidding up prices for the limited number of contractors.', 'Construction prices nationwide have risen about 5 percent a year for the past three years, according to the Turner Building Cost Index. Costs have gone up even faster in big cities and across California, according to RSMeans, a unit of Gordian, which compiles construction data. In the Bay Area, builders say construction prices are up 30 percent over the past three years — so much that even luxury projects are being stalled by rising costs.', '“It’s reached the point where you cannot get enough rent or you cannot sell enough units to make it a viable deal,” said Lou Vasquez, a founding partner and managing director of Build, a real estate developer in San Francisco.', 'The surge in construction prices is coming at the worst possible time for booming cities like New York, Seattle and San Francisco, already dealing with an affordable-housing crunch that has increased the homeless populations and stoked acrimonious debates about growth and gentrification. City and state legislators have tried to tackle their housing problems with proposals to increase subsidized affordable housing, reduce building regulations and make it legal to build taller.', 'But even if every overpriced city suddenly overcame the thicket of zoning rules and neighborhood opposition that make it difficult to build new housing in the first place — which seems doubtful — today’s diminished building industry would lack the capacity to build at the needed pace. This affects the rich as well as the poor, because it raises the cost of high-end condos and affordable housing alike.', 'Later this year, California residents will vote on a proposed $4 billion bond to build more subsidized affordable housing. In San Francisco, where developers say the per-unit construction cost is edging toward $800,000, that would buy about 5,000 units, a relative blip. “Costs have risen so much that it is not possible to build homes where people want to live at the prices and rents they can afford,” said John Burns, founder of John Burns Real Estate Consulting.', 'All this has prompted developers like Mr. Holliday to go scrambling for cheaper and less labor-intensive construction methods — and investors to pour money into start-ups that promise to do just that. Katerra, a three-year-old prefabricated building company in the Silicon Valley city of Menlo Park, has raised $1.1 billion in venture capital. A number of other building start-ups including Blokable, based in Seattle; Kasita, based in Austin, Tex.; and RAD Urban, based in Oakland, Calif., have all popped up over the past five years.', '“The current system can’t meet demand and that’s resulting in a lack of opportunity for some folks and a major hit to the economy,” said Stonly Baptiste, a co-founder of Urban Us, a Brooklyn-based venture capital firm that invested in Blokable. “These aren’t small problems and they aren’t small markets.”', 'The technologies vary but generally involve simplifying construction through prefabricated panels that can be assembled like Ikea furniture and modular apartments that can be stacked together like Lego bricks. A recent survey by FMI, a management-consulting and investment banking company focused on the engineering and construction industry, found a third of respondents said they were looking at some form of off-site construction, a steep rise from 2010. The interest extends from housing to hotels to medical facilities, industrial companies and even fast-food restaurants.', '“It’s one of those things that looks like an overnight success but it’s taken 10 years and hundreds of people toiling,” said Chris Giattina, chief executive of BLOX, a Birmingham, Ala., company that builds hospitals with modular components.', 'The global construction industry is a $10 trillion behemoth whose structures determine where people live, how they get to work and what cities look like. It is also one of the world’s least efficient businesses. The construction productivity rate — how much building workers do for each hour of labor they put in — has been flat since 1945, according to the McKinsey Global Institute. Over that period, sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and retail saw their productivity rates surge by as much as 1,500 percent. In other words, while the rest of the economy has been supercharged by machines, computers and robots, construction companies are about as efficient as they were in World War II.', 'To understand this, consider how buildings are actually built. It all starts with the developer, who doesn’t actually build anything but instead secures a piece of land and a loan, and gets the project approved by the government. At that point the money is passed to the general contractor that made a successful bid to build the project, who passes it to subcontractors that won the bidding for things like plumbing and sheet metal work, which often pass it to even more subcontractors.', 'Contractors describe this handoff as “brokering risk.” What they mean is that while everyone in the chain has agreed to build a certain piece of the project for a set amount of money and in a given amount of time, none of them are sure they can do so as cheaply or quickly as they’ve promised. They broker that risk by paying someone else to do it for them, minus a small fee.', '“Say you’re a general contractor and your subcontractor agrees to do a job. Once we have a contract I don’t care how many man hours you put into it because that’s your problem now,” said Randy Miller, chief executive of RAD Urban, describing the thinking behind the process.', 'The goal of prefabricated building companies is to turn this model on its head. Instead of offloading risk, the contractor assumes all of it. Instead of sending jobs to subcontractors, they hire their own factory workers. “The general contractor says, ‘Oh my God, construction is scary, let me broker all that risk,’” Mr. Miller said. “I’m saying, ’Oh my God, construction is scary, let me plan and control it.”', 'The basic concept isn’t new. In 1624, Massachusetts settlers built homes out of prefabricated materials shipped from England. The pattern was repeated in Australia, Africa and India as the British Empire shipped colonists and structures wide across the globe, according to “Prefab Architecture,” by Ryan E. Smith, a professor at the University of Utah.', 'Over the next few centuries, new versions of the idea seemed to pop up anywhere people needed to build lots of homes in a hurry — during the California Gold Rush, after the Chicago fire, and through America’s westward expansion. In the early part of the 20th century, Sears sold tens of thousands of kits for Sears Modern Homes, which consisted of prefabricated parts and panels that buyers assembled.', 'Along the way, the construction industry absorbed manufacturing concepts such as the assembly-line techniques that were utilized by Levitt & Sons, the pioneer of mass-built subdivisions. But the idea of factory-built housing was never adopted long or widely enough to make an impact, at least in the United States.', 'One reason the United States has lagged behind Europe, Australia and Asia — which all have well-established companies doing modular and prefabricated building — is that it is a predominantly suburban nation, and the vast supply of open land has kept the cost of single-family-home building relatively low. Another is that the construction industry has slim profit margins and invests little in research and development.', 'The chances of being burned are high, and each high-profile failure leads to a furlough of the concept. In the mid-2000s housing boom, Pulte Homes, one of the country’s largest builders, opened a prefabrication plant that aimed to revolutionize how homes were built. The company closed it with the onset of the housing bust in 2007.', 'Now, instead of single-family homes, companies doing prefab building are focusing on higher-density condominiums and apartments. That’s because, while single-family home construction remains well below its level before the recession, multifamily condominium and apartment buildings have rebounded strongly. “Our goal is to be able to do a 40-story tower in 12 months, at half the cost of traditional construction,” said Mr. Miller of RAD Urban.', 'Still, even if builders are able to reduce construction costs, that doesn’t necessarily mean they will be successful. Behind each of these companies is a bet that they can build far more efficiently than current methods. That bet has yet to be proven, at least on a large scale.', 'Mr. Holliday of Factory OS started thinking about modular housing about four years ago, when he was struggling to build a project in Truckee, Calif., a mountain town of about 15,000 people near Lake Tahoe. The idea was to build a cluster of 800 to 1,000 high-density apartments and condominiums, but “the numbers wouldn’t work,” he said. “You couldn’t get the construction costs down enough.”', 'Mr. Holliday floated the idea of modular building to his longtime contractor, Larry Pace, from Cannon Constructors, who over the past four decades has built various projects from one-off homes to high-rise condo and office towers. “I said ‘modular jobs have been a fiasco — we don’t need that in our lives,’” Mr. Pace recalled, adding an expletive for emphasis.', 'But Mr. Holliday persisted, and he and Mr. Pace used modular technology from two manufacturers to build four projects in the Bay Area. They are planning to do the same with the original Truckee development. Mr. Pace became so comfortable with modular that he suggested that they find some investors and build a factory of their own.', 'On a recent afternoon, Mr. Pace laid out the factory’s process. At the first station, just past the door, four workers toiled above and below a raised platform to build what would eventually become the floor. The two men up top laid down flooring while a man and woman stood below simultaneously installing pipes.', 'From there the unit would move steadily down the line, and, over 21 additional stations, would acquire toilets, indoor walls, outdoor walls, a roof, electric outlets, windows, sinks, countertops and tiling. It takes about a week to finish a unit, Mr. Pace said. The goal is to churn out about 2,000 apartments a year, which would be turned into four- and five-story buildings with 80 to 150 units each.', 'For workers, factory building seems to mean lower wages but steadier work. Factory OS pays about $30 an hour with medical insurance and two weeks of vacation. That’s about half what workers can make on a construction site, but the work is more regular and, for many, requires less commuting.', 'Tony Vandewark, a 51-year-old foreman at Factory OS, is OK with the trade-off. Mr. Vandewark lives a few minutes from the factory in Vallejo, where homes cost less than half what they do closer to San Francisco. Contrast that with a job he once had in the Silicon Valley city of Sunnyvale. Mr. Vandewark drove two hours to work and three hours home before deciding to rent a room so he could stay closer to work on weekdays.', '“On a job site, you can go do piece work and make really big money, but then the job is gone,” he said.', 'In addition to not being rained on, one of the key differences between a construction site and Factory OS is that any worker can be trained to do any job. And for old-school trade unions, that is a declaration of war. “The business model is ‘Hooray for me,‘” without regard for anyone else, said Larry Mazzola Jr., business manager of UA Local 38, a San Francisco plumbers’ union with about 2,500 members across Northern California.', 'Factory OS is not anti-union: It has a contract with the Northern California Carpenters Regional Council, which has organized other modular factories and is banking on the technology’s continued growth. The issue is that builders are laid out like a Detroit auto factory, where one union represents all of the workers, and workers can be trained to do any job within the company walls.', 'That is a huge departure from construction sites, where unions representing plumbers, electricians, carpenters and various other trades each control their piece of the building process. Last year Mr. Mazzola wrote a letter to San Francisco’s mayor, Ed Lee, a month before he died, urging him to deny any city business — such as contracts for subsidized housing — to Factory OS.', '“Any decision to use Factory OS shows a blatant disregard for the other craft unions,” he wrote. He asked the mayor to refrain from contracting with the company unless it allowed craft unions to do their pieces of the work. “We realize modular is coming and we want to be part of it, but not at the expense of our workers, which is what’s happening right now,” Mr. Mazzola said in an interview.', 'Jay Bradshaw, director of organizing for the carpenters’ council representing Factory OS workers, said that would be impractical. Think back to that first station, where four people worked above and below the floor. In Mr. Mazzola’s world, a plumbers’ union would represent the workers installing pipes, while other unions would represent the workers up top.', '“It would never work to have upward of 10 or 15 labor organizations at a single employer in a factory setting,” Mr. Bradshaw said.', 'For Mr. Bradshaw, the real fight isn’t defending job titles but making sure construction workers remain part of a union at all. A short drive from Factory OS, at a carpenters’ training center, the union is developing a program to train housing-factory workers — something that, it hopes, will prepare more people for an industry that it has come to see as inevitable.', '“It sure blows the hell out of building in China,” he said.']"
63,Here’s how sails and liquefied natural gas could transform the shipping industry,2018-07-13T07:24:49+0000,"['The shipping industry plays a crucial role in the running of the global economy and like any major sector, it has an environmental impact.', 'In 2012, international shipping was responsible for an estimated 796 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions — around 2.2 percent of total global CO2 emissions that year, according to the International Maritime Organization.  In northern Europe, Finnish shipping business Viking Line is looking to mitigate its environmental footprint with innovative design.  “The Viking Grace is a  passenger cruise ferry operating between Turku in Finland and Stockholm in Sweden,” Kaj Takolander, vice president and head of sales and marketing at Viking Line, told CNBC’s “Sustainable Energy.”  Takolander added that the ship was 218 meters long and carried a combination of passengers, cars and freight. He explained that the vessel was powered by four main engines built by Wartsila. “We use gas as the fuel, but we have a spare system for diesel in case of problems with gas supply,” he said, adding that each engine has more than 10,000 horsepower.  The Viking Grace is something of a trailblazer — the first passenger ship of its size to run on sulphur-free liquefied natural gas (LNG), according to Viking Line. “The benefit with LNG is that the emissions are up to 85 percent lower than with an ordinary, traditional diesel engine,” Takolander said. “The sulphur emissions are much lower.”  The ship also uses an innovative sail system, a 24-meter-tall cylindrical rotor sail developed by Norsepower Oy, another Finnish company. The sail uses something called the “Magnus effect” for propulsion, according to Viking Line. As the rotor spins, passing air flows with a lower pressure on one side compared to the other. This difference in pressure creates a propulsion force that moves the ship forward.  Altogether, these new innovations and ideas are helping to reduce the ship’s environmental impact. “Our decision to test this technology is based on… simulations that show that we can save up to 300 tons of fuel,” Takolander said, “meaning we can cut CO2 emissions (by)… 900 tons a year.”']"

', 'In simple terms, “carbon neutral” means that CO2 emissions are offset by an equal amount of CO2 removal. If something is carbon negative, it means that more CO2 is removed from the atmosphere than emitted.', 'Looking forward, all new vessels owned by Maersk will be able to run on carbon neutral fuels, with the company stating it will “install dual fuel engines on future newbuildings.” The word “newbuilding” refers to a ship that has recently been built or is under construction.', 'The environmental footprint of shipping is significant. According to the International Energy Agency, in 2019 international shipping — a crucial cog in the world’s economy — was responsible for approximately 2% of “global energy-related CO2 emissions.”', 'Speaking to CNBC’s “Street Signs Europe” on Wednesday morning, Maersk’s head of decarbonization explained how several things had “gone in the right direction” when it came to accelerating the development of the methanol-fueled vessel.', '“We have learned a lot as a company about the opportunities that are there, technology has developed,” Morten Bo Christiansen said.', '“And, last but not least, our customers are clearly expecting this from us, they need us to support them in decarbonizing their supply chains.”', 'Asked how his company would source enough carbon neutral fuels to meet its future needs, Christiansen stated that it was a “chicken and egg situation.” “There’s a lot of projects on the drawing board but not a lot of willing off-takers,” he said. “With this, we are trying to actually make a statement that we want to get this ball rolling, we want to get started on producing these fuels and actually putting them in the market so that the market can scale.”', 'Maersk, he explained, was in dialogue with several partners with regards to this issue, although it was not yet ready to name who it was dealing with.', '“But definitely … this will be the big challenge: to get sufficient supplies of properly carbon neutral fuels,” he added.', 'Christiansen went on to state that Maersk’s customers would “get access to a product that represents a concept that is properly scalable.”', '“It also means that they will get a feel for how much extra cost this will add,” he said.', 'Noting that while the company was not yet certain with regards to price points, Christiansen added: “What we do know is that, when we look at the end consumer products, so a pair of sneakers or a flat screen TV, then … the impact on those products would be measured in cents rather than dollars.”', '“So from that perspective, it would seem like something that can actually be absorbed, and hopefully scale the decarbonization of our customers’ supply chains.”']"

Walmart was deep in talks with the Boston-based start-up, and pharmaceutical maker Novartis was also hovering.', 'But bankers from Frank Quattrone’s Qatalyst Partners suggested that Parker and co-founder and product chief Elliot Cohen fly across country for a meeting with one particular Amazon executive: Nader Kabbani. A 14-year company veteran and guest concert pianist with the Seattle Symphony who’d recently been named Amazon’s vice president of consumables, Kabbani shared Parker’s concern about the pharmacy industry and the dominant players’ inability or unwillingness to put the consumer first.', 'Eventually, Parker and Kabbani were the only ones doing the talking, as all the other participants faded into the background. And from there it didn’t take long for Parker to decide that the bidding had ended. He was selling the company to Amazon.', 'On June 28, Amazon announced that it was buying PillPack for an undisclosed sum (later revealed as $753 million), snapping up a company that delivers most of the medications consumers can get from their local drugstore packaged in convenient white packets so people will remember to take them, along with automatic refills and 24/7 customer support.', 'Shares of CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid tumbled on concern that Amazon was further encroaching on their territory after already taking a huge chunk of the market for toiletries and household goods. In the press release, Jeff Wilke, the head of Amazon’s worldwide consumer business, said the companies would work together to help consumers “save time, simplify their lives and feel healthier.”', 'What Wilke didn’t say was that Parker, the son of a New Hampshire pharmacist, had plans to surpass $1 billion in revenue by 2020, or that PillPack would soon be negotiating with large insurers to get its service into the hands of many more people while aggressively building out its technology to serve them.', 'Almost 11 months later and about $100 million richer, Parker’s title is still PillPack CEO, and the only noticeable differences to the outside eye are that his website now says “an amazon company” under the logo and Amazon has a new landing page introducing Prime members to the service. Inside the company, Parker, a 33-year-old pharmacist turned internet entrepreneur, is the face of Amazon’s audacious plan to bust into a prescription drug market that to date has represented perhaps the largest and most glaring gap in its retail empire.', 'CNBC spoke to a dozen people close to the founders, including investors, friends and PillPack employees for this story, most of whom asked not to be named because of confidentiality agreements. PillPack declined to make Parker or Cohen available for an interview, and neither have spoken publicly since the deal was finalized. Amazon declined to comment and Kabbani didn’t respond to a request for comment.', 'Here’s a glimpse of what Amazon is now attacking:', 'Spending on U.S. prescription medications is approaching $500 billion a year and growing up to 7% annually, according to IQVIA, a provider of health data.

We also know that Amazon has not only been continuously adding household products to its marketplace, but has also been establishing its own brands for things like batteries, toilet paper, light bulbs and towels. As delivery times come down to one day for Prime members, what’s the point of ever driving to your neighborhood pharmacy?', 'PillPack has spent years going through the hard work of getting licenses to ship to every state except Hawaii, and built a system that automatically manages refills and works with insurers on behalf of customers. It sorts pills and provides dispensers to make everything as easy as possible for users.', 'Fred Destin, an early PillPack investor, describes it as a “complicated and expensive” space with a potentially “big prize.” In other words, it’s the type of business that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos loves — huge dollars, antiquated technology and so many regulatory barriers that the “smart money” is staying far away. Bezos also knows something about the industry, having taken a board seat at Drugstore.com in the 1990s after Amazon invested in the company. (Walgreens acquired the online drugstore in 2011 for $429 million and shut it down five years later.)', 'It won’t be an easy market for Amazon to win. PillPack needs relationships with PBMs like Express Scripts and Caremark, which is owned by CVS, to reach the masses of consumers who get their medicines through insurers. Those businesses were worried about Amazon even before it acquired PillPack, because it’s really the only company that could conceivably break up their control if it were to jump into the distribution market and pressure drug manufacturers to lower prices. PillPack also was a concern because it had the potential to take substantial market share from the incumbents.', '“Amazon bought the one company in the space that all the PBMs and other pharmacy businesses were threatened by,” said Yumin Choi, a health-tech investor at Bain Capital Ventures. “The challenge is now they put a stake in the ground and the flag has been planted.”', 'Amazon has to contend with the added problems that come with a disparate ecosystem of physicians, insurance companies and medical records providers, all with their own silos and disconnected systems. Amazon and PillPack may be able to create a better experience for consumers when it comes to delivering medicines, but playing a role in fixing the other inefficiencies may be out of their purview.', '“There’s a lot that’s not under their control,” said Eric Percher, an equity analyst covering the pharmacy supply chain at Nephron Research. It’s not clear if Amazon can change the way “that the patient interacts with the pharmacy supply chain and the payor,” he said.', 'Parker, who has sandy blonde hair, an unkempt beard and thick-rimmed glasses, doesn’t come across as a hard-charging executive scheming to take down the industry superpowers. Zen Chu, a PillPack investor and adviser who teaches health-care innovation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, joked that he looks more like a member of a Grateful Dead cover band, but with “exceptional clarity of vision.”', 'The pharmacy business is in Parker’s blood. Growing up, his dad owned a pharmacy in Concord, New Hampshire, where the younger Parker personally checked labels on pill bottles and delivered medicines to nursing homes and assisted living facilities.', 'He went to pharmacy school at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in Boston and, while there, would periodically go to events at nearby MIT to look for students exploring innovative work in health technology. That’s where he met Cohen, who was attending business school after studying computer science at the University of California at Berkeley. At MIT, Cohen co-founded a program called Hacking Medicine for students interested in medical entrepreneurship.', 'Cohen wasn’t sold on the idea behind PillPack until he went home and saw his dad, who had undergone quadruple bypass heart surgery while in high school, struggling to manage multiple medications. He texted Parker to say he was in, and the pair spent a weekend putting together a prototype, which won the 2012 Hacking Medicine hackathon and landed them checks from MIT’s Chu and his wife and fellow investor Katie Rae.', 'In 2014, the year PillPack started serving customers, Parker’s dad joined as one of the company’s first pharmacists in the office in Manchester, New Hampshire, located 20 minutes from Concord. The founders would drive to the local IKEA to get furniture for the pharmacy.', 'At internal meetings, Parker talked about the opportunities to modernize the pharmacy experience and to develop an aspirational brand, like what Warby Parker created in the stodgy eyeglasses market, rather than constantly reminding people that they’re sick.', '“TJ used to talk at all-hands about the local CVS, where you’d see aisles stacked with three-liter bottles of Coke with fluorescent lights and grey carpeting,” said AJ Resnick, a director of analytics at Pillpack from 2015 to 2016. In his mind, that “wasn’t the experience that people deserve.”', 'Growth was slow for the first couple years because PillPack had to file for licenses in every state and needed to open physical retail stores in certain states to stay in-network with the PBMs. It also had an advertising problem, because ad teams at Google and Facebook mistakenly labeled PillPack as a drug manufacturer, which required it to include all sorts of safety issues that weren’t relevant.', 'Fortunately for Parker, he’d taken a small check from Kevin Colleran of Slow Ventures, an early member of Facebook’s ad sales team. Colleran connected Parker to the right people at Facebook to clear up the matter and get PillPack off what the investor called “the naughty list.”', '“Once they got on Facebook, it helped escalate their growth more than other platforms,” said Colleran, who also became close friends with Parker.', 'Then consumers caught on. By the time of last year’s acquisition, the business was on track to generate $299 million in annual revenue, with plans to more than double in 2019 to $635 million before reaching $1.2 billion in 2020, according to a pitch deck viewed by CNBC. Those are big numbers for a company founded just five years earlier, and proved there was plenty of demand for what PillPack was offering.', 'But PillPack was burning through $6 million a month at its peak because of the low profit margins and escalating costs of expansion. Some of the high expenses were tied to the development of a back-end software system called PharmacyOS, which the company was designing to automate the process of prescription renewals, billing insurance, getting authorizations from providers and sending out notifications. David Frankel, an early PillPack backer, calls it the “spaghetti connectivity” of the pharmacy world.', 'Parker knew in 2016 that Amazon was interested in the space through conversations with executives at the company, according to people with knowledge of the talks. Amazon was also dabbling around the edges of the market and would soon start hiring business leaders focused on pharmacy and selling things like at-home DNA tests and over-the-counter medicines.', 'Having already raised $115 million, including a $60 million round in mid-2016, PillPack needed more capital to keep the business afloat. Parker was gearing up to raise more cash had the deal with Amazon or another bidder not materialized.', 'By early 2018, it was becoming clear that Amazon could be an ally or a competitor. Parker chose the former option.', 'For Amazon, which recorded over $230 billion in sales last year, PillPack doesn’t move the needle at its current size. The value for Amazon is in the promise of plugging the delivery network into the giant e-commerce machine, especially when considering that the average PillPack user in 2018 was worth $5,000 in revenue, through insurance payments and patient co-pays, according to the slide presentation.', 'That’s far more than the average Prime member, who spends about $1,300 a year on Amazon after the $119 annual subscription, according to a 2017 study. Also, most of PillPack’s users are in their 50s and 60s and they’re loyal customers, giving Amazon an older demographic to target with other product promotions. You could imagine signing in to order your blood-thinning medication and seeing a recommendation for shaving cream, toilet paper or nail polish, all things you’d been buying at the store.', 'Amazon is already using that tactic in reverse, promoting the PillPack service to a targeted group of Prime subscribers. But Amazon can provide a whole lot more to PillPack than access to 100 million-plus Prime users.', 'One effort underway involves large insurers, who could offer the mail-order service as a perk to their members, and in return provide the company with potentially millions of new customers.', 'According to a confidential document viewed by CNBC, Blue Cross Blue Shield, a federation of 36 health insurance plans that cover more than 100 million Americans, has reached out to PillPack about providing the service to members. While no deal has materialized, the document says Blue Cross would provide home delivery and other benefits as well as discounts on over-the-counter drugs and possibly a branded medication dispenser.', 'A Blue Cross spokesperson declined to comment.', 'Amazon can also add the muscle PillPack needs to stand up to the PBMs, which effectively determine whether a pharmacy is able to get customers. Large employers, insurers and Medicare and Medicaid rely on PBMs to administer prescription coverage, and PBMs have not looked kindly on start-ups delivering medications to the home because many offer their own lucrative mail-order services.', 'In 2016, Express Scripts, the largest PBM, threatened to remove PillPack from its network, claiming the company was misrepresenting itself as a retail pharmacy instead of a mail-delivery pharmacy. The move would have cut PillPack off from about a third of its customers virtually overnight.', '“There were many, many attempts to crush this company,” said Jim Messina, a former White House deputy chief of staff under Barack Obama who was hired by PillPack to navigate the challenges presented by PBMs.', 'Messina, who joined PillPack’s board in November 2017 along with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, laid out an aggressive campaign that involved setting up the website fixpharmacy.com to rally support from existing customers in an effort to reach key policymakers in Washington. Parker set up a war room at the office, where top staffers put in 16-hour days on the #fixpharmacy crusade. In just over a week, the marketing team, led by former IDEO executive Colin Raney, published multiple videos featuring customers talking about their dependence on the service.', 'tweet', 'TJ will “go to war and fight for his company and try to do things differently,” Messina said.', 'However, Express Scripts did have a case. The company had given PillPack a contract to sell as a retail pharmacy, and not by mail. PillPack had some physical locations but it was shipping medications to patients from those pharmacies. Express Scripts eventually agreed to give a mail-order contract to PillPack (which is still in effect), but not before Parker fessed up to an “administrative error” that resulted in the company briefly shipping to states where it wasn’t properly licensed.', 'Brian Henry, a spokesman for Express Scripts, told Forbes at the time that, “there are standards and regulations and industry practices you have to follow.” He declined to provide further comment to CNBC.', 'Parker’s history with Express Scripts and unwillingness to back down from a fight was one of the qualities that most attracted Amazon to PillPack, according to people familiar with the matter.', '“He thought that the only way to make a change is to shine a light on the dark spots, and he had the information on where those dark spots were,” said Zachariah Reitano, CEO of men’s health start-up Roman, which counts Parker as an investor. “He did it in a way where it benefited the patient, and not just for the benefit of his company.”', 'PillPack is just a piece of Amazon’s expansive plan to uproot the $3 trillion U.S. health-care industry. The company is also working with J.P. Morgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway on a joint venture called Haven aiming to improve care and bring down the costs. It has plans to open its own health clinics for employees, and there’s a secretive group called Grand Challenge working on telemedicine and applying machine learning to cancer research, among other futuristic projects. Then there’s Amazon Web Services and the Alexa voice division, which have various efforts underway to pull together medical records and mine data.', 'But for all the indigestion Amazon has created in the pharmaceutical and health-care industries, the company doesn’t appear to have any grand plan yet to take on the market. Cohen spoke at a recent investment bank event and told those in the crowd that there’s no single person in Seattle who owns the health efforts, according to a person who was in attendance.', 'The immediate objective for PillPack is to keep growing and hiring. The company didn’t insist on retaining its brand permanently as part of the acquisition, according to a person familiar with the transaction, so it could eventually be renamed to something like Amazon Pharmacy.', 'Amazon is staffing up the business to serve tens of thousands more customers and adding the necessary pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. Amazon has about 50 PillPack job openings listed on its careers site, primarily in Boston and Somerville. Some of the most recent listings are for a packing and shipping specialist and visual designer, and more than half the positions are in software development, including for a “team lead,” tasked with “establishing mechanisms and best practices for a growing team.”', 'PillPack has bolstered ad spending on TV stations (including CNBC and MSNBC) that reach an older audience, as well as across digital networks like Facebook.', 'It’s also forging ahead with plans already in place in Phoenix to build out a 175,000-square-foot pharmacy operation, which is about the size of a Walmart Supercenter, to serve as a retail pharmacy and distribution center. The facility has been adding state licenses that will allow PillPack to better serve customers in the western U.S.', 'When the acquisition was disclosed in June, some analysts speculated that Amazon wanted PillPack because it had pharmacy licenses in almost every state. The consulting firm Kantar said PillPack’s 49 licenses make it “incredibly asset-rich.”', 'In Arizona, PillPack has been lobbying local officials to allow pharmacy technicians, the people who assist pharmacists, to transfer medications from other pharmacies into PillPack. A handful of employees and a PillPack lawyer showed up at an Arizona State Board of Pharmacy meeting in December to request an exemption from a law that requires pharmacists to handle transfers that come in by phone. PillPack’s representatives said the company already uses technicians for those tasks in New Hampshire (one of the 13 states that allow it) and has a rigorous training program and oversight in place to ensure patient safety.', 'The PillPack crew didn’t talk about cost savings or the need to rapidly scale, but you could hear the Amazon influence in their argument. For PillPack to function like an Amazon business, it has to get the most of both technology and lower-cost employees. The company was granted a six-month exemption, after which it has to produce a report on findings and error rates.', 'Since the acquisition last June, Parker has relocated to Park City, Utah, near the company’s sales and business development office. On most Tuesdays, he flies to Seattle, where he recently bought a house, and stays until Thursday.', 'He continues to work closely with Kabbani, who has facilitated introductions between PillPack’s team and top Amazon executives in areas like AWS and Haven, people familiar with the matter said.', 'Though Parker and Cohen report to Kabbani, the founders are very much the ones leading the charge. Kabbani is a respected manager who has risen through the ranks at Amazon, helping build the Kindle self-publishing platform and then leading a variety of last-mile delivery projects, including Flex, the on-demand delivery hiring service. But he doesn’t have much experience in health care or drug supply chain, a fact he made clear to the PillPack team during the acquisition talks, according to people familiar with the discussions.', 'Kabbani’s logistics expertise is likely to play into PillPack’s effort to expand its on-the-ground presence. The company has physical pharmacies in five states — New Hampshire, New York, Texas, Florida and Arizona — which it needs to legally ship to all the various states and so it can deliver quickly, without having to send packages across the country.', 'Cohen’s focus has largely been on PharmacyOS, which PillPack launched in 2017 as a “brand new operating system that we built from the ground up,” replacing lots of old, off-the-shelf technology.', 'According to an internal presentation PillPack executives created before the Amazon deal, the company was pitching PharmacyOS as its next big growth driver, and two people familiar with the matter said it was one of the main pieces that interested Amazon. PillPack has been trying to get the technology in the hands of pharmaceutical makers, doctors and insurance companies to automate and streamline their processes as well, so it’s not just used internally.', '“Such a move would mean they’re expanding far beyond their core solution to the tens of millions of people who take generic medicines,” said Stephen Buck, a former vice president at drug distributor McKesson, after CNBC described the document. Buck, who’s now CEO of health-tech start-up Courage Health, said it suggests that “PillPack is going to be a much bigger player in pharmacy.”', 'Just after the deal came together and before taking up his new post in Seattle, Parker wanted to celebrate. He invited some friends and their family members to his home in the Boston suburb of Somerville, a short walk from PillPack’s headquarters, to enjoy a summer barbecue.', 'Parker and Cohen cooked steaks and veggies on the grill in the garden. Meanwhile, Kabbani took a seat at the piano in the living room and entertained the kids in attendance with classical music. Destin, the early investor, was there with his 12-year-old son, who showed off some of his card tricks. The boy was such a hit with Kabbani that the Amazon executive jokingly offered him a job.', '“It didn’t feel like a commercial transaction,” said Destin, the founder of venture firm Stride.VC. “It felt like a family barbecue and that touched me.

The small vials are traveling on airplanes and trucks, and some times inside of specially made hand-held coolers.', 'So far, two vaccines have been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use in the U.S.: those by Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna. Several other drugmakers also have agreements to provide their vaccines to the federal government once they are approved. AstraZeneca’s vaccine, developed with Oxford University, was just approved for emergency use in the U.K. but is still in clinical trials in the U.S.', 'The much-awaited vaccines — and whether they’re distributed quickly, smoothly and widely — will help determine whether the U.S. can gain control of a virus that’s killed more than 355,000 people across the country, overwhelmed hospitals and thrust the nation’s economy into a recession.', 'Health-care workers and nursing home residents were among the first to receive them in mid-December, followed by older Americans or those considered more at risk based on their job, age or medical conditions, depending on the state. The U.S. has distributed just over 17 million doses, and 4.8 million people have been given their first shot as of Tuesday — far short of the country’s original goal of immunizing at least 20 million people by the end of 2020.', 'Eventually, the shots will be available to the general public at neighborhood pharmacies and grocery stores.', 'Here’s how that journey looks for the vaccines:', 'Within hours of the FDA’s approval of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines last month, FedEx and United Parcel Service started shipping vials of doses. The logistics rivals teamed up and split deliveries by state, UPS Healthcare President Wes Wheeler told a Senate panel at a hearing last month.', 'Delivering coronavirus vaccines, however, isn’t first time the companies have handled sensitive medical products. UPS provided logistical support throughout Pfizer’s clinical trials. FedEx delivers flu vaccines every year and shipped over 80 million H1N1 vaccine doses in 2009, said Richard Smith, FedEx Express executive vice president.', '“This is what we were built for, and we plan for things like this regularly,” Smith told lawmakers. “Maybe not on this scale with all of the ins and outs, but we are well-versed in this type of planning.”', 'Pfizer’s vaccine is being transported in custom thermal shippers designed to keep the doses at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit. Each suitcase-sized box can hold 4,875 doses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The shippers also have a GPS-enabled thermal sensor.', 'Ensuring the vials are kept at the right temperature is a tricky process that’s had to be adjusted along the way. U.S. officials quarantined several thousand doses of Pfizer’s vaccine in California and Alabama in mid-December after an “anomaly” in the transportation process caused the storage temperature to get too cold.', 'After leaving Pfizer’s storage sites in Michigan and Wisconsin, Covid vaccine shipments receive priority treatment, UPS and FedEx said.', 'Vaccine packages that UPS delivers are given a gold priority label embedded with four trackers so the company can see the package as soon as it arrives at every destination. Each of its trucks also has a device that monitors its location, light exposure and temperature. Those vaccines are transferred to UPS’ Worldport facilities in Louisville, Kentucky, where they are immediately expedited.', '“We will see the package; it will get priority,” Wheeler said. “It goes on the plane first. It comes off the plane first.”', 'UPS created a 24/7 command center just for vaccine shipments where employees monitor the shipments and intercept a package if something goes wrong, Wheeler said. Similar to UPS, FedEx’s “priority alert” team actively tracks the shipments using its own technology.', 'Passenger airlines also play a role. Even before Pfizer’s vaccine was cleared by the FDA, United Airlines started shipping doses on Boeing 777s from Brussels, near the pharmaceutical giant’s Belgium plant to the carrier’s hub at Chicago O’Hare. They were taken by truck from the airport to Pfizer’s plant in Kalamazoo, Michigan to position them for distribution.', 'American Airlines ran trial flights in November between Miami and South America to stress test thermal packaging and handling before it started shipping the vaccines.', 'Last month, United and Delta Air Lines started shipping smaller loads of the vaccine in the bellies of passenger planes within the U.S.', 'Airplanes carrying the vaccine get takeoff and landing priority from the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA also gave United special approval to carry more dry ice than typically allowed to transport doses from Brussels to Chicago.', 'The airlines and logistics companies had mobilized extra manpower last month as a snowstorm swept through the Northeast and threatened to shut down runways. The FAA urged airports to have people ready to clear snow.', 'Shipments from FedEx and UPS head to different hubs for distribution. In some cases, they arrive at hospitals or health-care systems where they are stored and later administered to staff. In other cases, they head to retail pharmacies.', 'UT Health Austin received notice on Dec. 12 that it would receive its first shipment of 2,925 doses of vaccine the next day, said Dr. Amy Young, chief clinical office. It had already received supplies needed for administering the shot, like syringes and alcohol swabs, about a week before, said Young, who also is vice dean of professional practice at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin.', 'When the shipment arrived via FedEx truck, hospital staff checked the temperature of the doses at the facility’s loading dock to make sure they remained at the necessary temperature, Young said. They then transported the boxes to their ultra-cold freezer for the night. Hospital staff started immunizing people the next day.', 'Riverside Health System in Virginia, which received its first shipment of just under 3,000 doses on Dec. 15, followed a similar process, said Cindy Williams, vice president and chief pharmacy officer. Riverside was able to track the FedEx shipment as it arrived at a nearby airport.', '“We did, in fact, get notification that it was on the ground and within about an hour or so it was pulling into our loading dock,” Williams said.', 'Though Riverside predicted the first week of vaccinations would have a slow start, the process was much more efficient, Williams said.', '“We are ramping things up pretty rapidly, and we’re also finding that team members are very willing to step up and sign up for the clinics,” Williams said.', 'The special containers for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines also act as mobile freezers for clinics that don’t have specialty equipment. They can be stored for up to 30 days if they’re refilled with dry ice every five days.', 'The vaccine developed by Moderna must be kept frozen — but not at the ultra-low temperatures required for Pfizer’s shots. Moderna’s needs to be stored at between negative 13 and 5 degrees Fahrenheit and protected from light, according to CDC guidelines.', 'Moderna’s vaccine, however, can be stored in the refrigerator at between 36 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit for up to 30 days.', 'UPS is producing its own dry ice — over 24,000 pounds a day — for anyone who needs it for the vaccines.', 'Walgreens and CVS Health have turned some of their drugstores into designated hubs with special freezers, dry ice and staff trained about how to handle the vaccines. The federal government tapped the companies to inoculate residents and staff at nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the country.', '“Once we get them into those hubs, that’s where the planning really works locally with the states, with the long-term care facilities and with our field teams,” said Rick Gates, Walgreens’ senior vice president of pharmacy and health care.', 'About 10% of CVS pharmacies are serving as “hubs” or “depots,” said Chris Cox, a senior vice president at CVS and a liaison to Operation Warp Speed, the federal effort to help develop, make and distribute Covid vaccines.', '“There’s nothing special about these pharmacies other than their geographic proximity to the most number of nursing homes, so that we can really optimize our routes,” he said.', 'Pharmacists and technicians at long-term care facilities wait until the morning of the vaccinations to move the Pfizer-BioNTech inoculations from ultra-cold storage and into a refrigerator, where it thaws, Cox said. The doses can be stored in a regular refrigerator at 35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit for up to five days, according to Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine fact sheet.', 'They are then loaded into a specially made small, hand-held cooler designed to maintain that temperature for up to 24 hours.', 'The Moderna vaccine must remain frozen for transport. It’s then carried in the same cooler — but with cooling inserts and is thawed on-site at the facility before it is administered, Cox said.', 'Each cooler can hold 500 Pfizer doses or 1,000 Moderna doses since the Pfizer shots come in smaller bottles, according to CVS. Before giving the shot, health-care staff must add a saline solution to Pfizer’s dose before it’s injected, while Moderna’s vaccine doesn’t need to be diluted.', 'Both vaccines need to be thawed before injecting and cannot be refrozen, putting unused doses at risk of going bad. Pfizer’s vaccine takes 30 minutes and Moderna’s vaccine takes an hour to thaw at room temperature, a CVS spokesman said.', 'Both vaccines also need to be used relatively quickly after thawing. Undiluted vials of Pfizer’s vaccine cannot be stored at room temperature for more than two hours. Once diluted, they need to be used within six hours.', 'Moderna’s vaccine is stable at room temperature for up to 12 hours if the vials haven’t been punctured and six hours once they’ve been punctured.', 'Reports of unused and discarded doses have started to trickle in across the country as local health departments struggle to meet the tricky dosing requirements.', 'Authorities in Wisconsin said they arrested a pharmacist last week after he admitted to removing 57 vials containing 500 doses of Moderna’s vaccine from a pharmacy refrigerator and intentionally allowing them to spoil.', 'The vaccine’s final stop is the same: jabbed into millions of American arms.', 'Teams of pharmacists from CVS and Walgreens are administering the vaccines at more than 70,000 long-term care facilities, including nursing homes, according to CVS Chief Medical Officer Dr. Troyen Brennan. The size of the teams will vary based on the number of staff and residents.', 'At nursing homes, pharmacists in protective gear go room by room to vaccinate residents who have agreed to be inoculated, Cox said. At facilities where residents are more mobile, they’ll have a central on-site clinic. They’ll also vaccinate staff.', 'Those vaccinations began Dec. 18 in Ohio, Connecticut and Florida. They are now available in nursing homes in almost every state and the District of Columbia.', 'CVS and Walgreens, are nudging people to return for their second shot with phone calls, emails and text messages as well as reminder cards. Doses must be spaced out properly — 21 days for the Pfizer vaccine and 28 days for the Moderna vaccine.', 'U.K. health officials have decided to implement a 12-week delay between the first and second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines in order to cover as much of the population as possible.', 'U.S. health officials, who haven’t approved AstraZeneca’s vaccine yet, have advised against any changes in the dosing schedules, although Trump administration vaccine czar Moncef Slaoui said they are considering cutting Moderna’s dose in half for younger people to increase its availability.', 'The distribution has been slow going, hampered by the holidays, manufacturing delays and funding shortfalls and glitches in state programs designed to administer the shots to people. Roughly 4.8 million doses have been distributed to long-term care facilities, but just 429,066 shots have been given as of Tuesday morning, according to the CDC.', 'CVS and Walgreens executives still think the shots could be available to all Americans at their nearby grocery store or drugstore as early as March, much like they are for the seasonal flu. More than a dozen retail chains and pharmacies, including Kroger, Walmart and Costco, have signed on as partners with the federal government to give the shots. Some of them, such as Walmart, say they’re already getting staff and freezers ready — even as they wait for doses to arrive.', 'CNBC’s Leslie Josephs, Kevin Stankiewicz, Will Feuer and MacKenzie Sigalos contributed to this story.']"

', 'Lautenschleger is one of several Amazon sellers who are up in arms over a recent policy change meant to help the company conserve space in its warehouses as it faces a pandemic-fueled surge in e-commerce demand alongside the peak holiday shopping season. ', 'In August, Amazon put in place stricter quantity limits on shipments from third-party sellers that use its fulfillment service to package and ship orders, known as Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA. The limits apply to all product categories and differ on an item-by-item basis.', 'For Lautenschleger, it means he can only send in roughly 230 units per shipment of his fast-selling “Anchorman: The Game,” whereas he would’ve sent in thousands of units of a hot-selling item in years past.', 'With the Anchorman game out of stock, Lautenschleger said all he can do is send in more inventory and wait for it to arrive at FBA warehouses. In the meantime, he said he’s losing out on potential sales, which could have lasting consequences for his business, like determining how many new employees he can afford to hire in the new year.', '“You have to sell the products to be able to send them in, but you have to have them in in order to sell them,” Lautenschleger said in an interview with CNBC. “So that’s the Catch-22 that we find ourselves in now.”', 'When Amazon announced the policy in August, it said the quantity limits would help ensure all sellers using FBA have space to store their products. The initiative was also meant to prevent the kinds of supply chain bottlenecks and delivery delays Amazon experienced during the early months of the pandemic. ', 'Few periods are as important for Amazon to live up to its two-day delivery promise and reputation as the “Everything Store” than the holiday shopping season. This year is forecast to be busier than ever, with U.S. shoppers expected to spend $189 billion online in November and December, a 33% increase year over year, according to Adobe Analytics. ', 'It’s not just Amazon that is feeling the pressure this holiday season. Many retailers, and also the National Retail Federation, have warned consumers to get their holiday shopping done early to avoid potential shipping chaos and to make sure they receive their gifts on time. Big-box retailers like Walmart and Target have pointed shoppers to curbside pickup in order to fulfill orders quickly, while on-demand delivery companies such as Postmates, Instacart and DoorDash have partnered up with companies like Sephora, Macy’s and Estee Lauder’s Le Labo to get items to people’s homes.', 'There are also fears of a significant capacity shortfall among major shipping carriers FedEx, the U.S. Postal Service and UPS, which reportedly told its drivers on Cyber Monday to stop picking up packages from some of the largest U.S. retailers after they exceeded their allocated volumes.', 'Amazon has ramped up capacity since March, growing its warehouse footprint across the country at an unprecedented speed. The company expects to increase its network square footage, which includes fulfillment center space, along with sort centers and delivery stations, by 50% this year, up from 15% growth in 2019.', 'Even with the added capacity, Amazon still had to take steps to conserve space in its U.S. warehouses, by limiting storage of third-party sellers’ products and its own goods.', '“I don’t think they’ve been quite able to get a grasp of the forecast,” said Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of consulting firm Logistics Trends & Insights. “When they said back in the third quarter that they were going to have 50% more space, that may have been adequate at the beginning of this year, but because of Covid, it’s no longer adequate.”', 'Sellers say they understand why Amazon needed to limit the size of shipments into its warehouses, but they feel the policy puts them in a bind during a holiday that’s already proven challenging due to the pandemic. ', 'The inventory-related struggles come as Amazon has highlighted success of small businesses on its platform on this year’s pandemic-delayed Prime Day as well as on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.', 'While the inventory restrictions aren’t limited to third-party sellers — Amazon has previously said it’s metering storage of its own products, too, in its warehouses — merchants said they felt like they had little say in how the limits are determined.', 'Several sellers who spoke to CNBC said they expect to finish out the year with sales up significantly from 2019, but that revenue could be better if not for the inventory restrictions.', 'Steven Pope, who sells wine glasses on Amazon, expressed frustration over how the company determined the quantity limits. Pope and other sellers who spoke to CNBC said Amazon calculates how many units they can send in by looking at the last 90 days of sales for a particular product. For new products, it’s even more strict, since there’s a “hard cap” of 200 units, Pope said.', 'Merchants who sell holiday products told CNBC that they felt the company wasn’t taking seasonality into account when determining the quantity limits.', 'One Amazon seller, who asked to remain anonymous, told CNBC they offer a popular Christmas bag on Amazon and are able to send in 50 units per shipment. However, they sell about 40 units per day and only have 150 units left in stock. The seller said they’ll likely need to restock soon, but they’re concerned they won’t be able to ship it in time for the rest of the holiday shopping rush.', 'An Amazon spokesperson said the company does factor in seasonality, along with a seller’s historical sales, forecast demand and the capacity available in its fulfillment centers, when setting quantity limits. The Amazon spokesperson didn’t answer specific questions around how far the company looks back when it assesses historical sales.', 'For new products, the company said it initially limits shipments to 200 units until sellers a build product sales history, but that it periodically evaluates and updates the minimum quantity so that a large majority of new products have enough units to establish a product sales history.', 'In August, Amazon told merchants if they sell all of their stock they could send in more inventory at any time. But sellers say it’s not that easy, since there are delays when they ship products to Amazon’s warehouses.', 'Jerry Kavesh, an Amazon merchant who sells cowboy boots, hats, belts and other items, said he’s been “sending in product like crazy,” but it has taken anywhere from 10 days to two weeks for it to enter FBA warehouses. Before, it would take only two to four days.', '“We’re out of stock in our warehouse and I know I have 30 units at Amazon, but they’re being processed,” Kavesh said in a recent interview. “It’s been that way for five days. It’s killing us.”', 'The Amazon spokesperson said it checks in seller inventory, on average, within three to five days of its arrival at its warehouses. The company added that some sellers may experience longer inbound times based on the facility they’re shipping to.', 'Pope said one of the top wine glasses sold by his business, Momstir, is now very close to stocking out, at a time when he typically sees a 400% spike in sales between Black Friday and Christmas. It means he’ll likely lose out on a significant chunk of holiday sales this year.', '“I was projecting I was going to probably do half a million just in December and now, realistically, I’m going to tap out at $310,000,” Pope said. “It’s depressing.”', 'Once an inventory limit is determined for a product, sellers can’t appeal to Amazon to ask that their limit be increased. A notice sent to sellers and viewed by CNBC says the company isn’t “accepting requests for higher quantity limits” and notes that “shipping a quantity above your limit may result in account suspension.”', 'Sellers are also concerned that if they run out of stock, their listing may be penalized in Amazon’s search ranking algorithms. Amazon will push listings down further in search results if it detects they are running low on inventory or are out of stock, sellers claim. An issue in the early months of the pandemic, some sellers previously raised prices on their products or cut back on advertising to avoid the same painful fate.', 'The amount of inventory sellers can send in this year is a far cry from what they’d usually have in stock. Lautenschleger, who helps run the novelty game business, said he’d typically send in 5,000 units in late summer, monitor sales in September and October, then send in another batch depending on feedback.', 'With FBA warehouses continuing to limit inventory shipments, some sellers have chosen to fulfill orders themselves or, like Lautenschleger’s businesses, have turned to third-party logistics providers to get products out the door in time for the holidays. Lautenschleger added that he considers his business to be “one of the lucky ones,” since it also sells products at Target and on its own website.', '“My job is to come up with new games,” Lautenschleger said. “I’m trying to grow our company in so many other ways, that for me to suddenly have to take on a daily inventory watch job, that was not in the cards of an already busy year.”']"

Starship prototypes stand at about 160 feet tall, or around the size of a 16-story building, and are built of stainless steel — representing the early version of the rocket that Musk unveiled in 2019. ', 'The rocket lifts off on top of a Super Heavy booster, which makes up the bottom half of the rocket and stands about 230 feet tall. Together, Starship and Super Heavy are nearly 400 feet tall when stacked for launch.', 'The company rolled out Super Heavy Booster 4 on Tuesday.', 'SpaceX has conducted multiple short test flights of Starship prototypes over the past year, but reaching orbit represents the next step in testing the rocket. The company in May revealed its plan for the first orbital flight, which would launch from the company’s facility in Texas and aim to splash down off the coast of Hawaii.', 'The company has been working rapidly to ready Starship and the Super Heavy booster for the orbital flight test, although a local environmental review by the Federal Aviation Administration needs to be completed before the launch happens.', 'Musk outlined four “significant items” that SpaceX aims to complete over the next two weeks in preparing Starship 20 for launch.', 'He said SpaceX needs to add the “final heat shield tiles” to the ship, add “thermal protection” to the Raptor rocket engines in Booster 4, complete work on “ground propellant storage tanks” and add a quick disconnect arm to the top of the recently built launch tower. The quick disconnect arm connects power and fuel lines to the rocket before launch.', 'While SpaceX’s fleet of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets are partially reusable, Musk’s goal is to make Starship fully reusable — a rocket that is more akin to a commercial airplane, with short turnaround times between flights such that the only major cost is fuel.', 'One important piece of making Starship fully reusable is improving its durability to survive the intense process of reentering the Earth’s atmosphere. Small hexagonal heat shield tiles are SpaceX’s answer to that problem, with the previously shiny Starship 20 rocket now covered in thousands of the tiles.', 'Musk noted that work on the tiles is about “98% done” for Starship 20, as “the remaining tiles are unique shapes requiring machining.”', 'NASA has been paying close attention to Starship’s development, especially as the U.S. space agency earlier this year awarded SpaceX a controversial $2.9 billion contract to deliver astronauts to the surface of the moon using the rockets.', 'Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA’s top official for science missions, told CNBC that he continues to watch progress on Starship.', '“Yes, I have been following this all along and am excited for @SpaceX achieving this milestone! Can’t wait to see it fly!” Zurbuchen wrote in a tweet.', 'Musk replied to Zurbuchen in another tweet, touting the projected capabilities of Starship.', '“Due to its size & ability to return science instruments even from deep space, Starship will enable a whole new class of science missions,” Musk wrote.']"
71,Lockheed Martin makes its combat ship more lethal as new Navy competition heats up,2017-11-18T19:00:00+0000,"['On the Wisconsin shore of the Menominee River a new 3,000-ton Freedom-class Littoral Combat Ship sits docked in the water. It’s already been delivered to the Navy by Lockheed Martin and it’s already active.', 'A crew of 50 live aboard and have been conducting tests for six months on nearby Lake Michigan. Next month, the warship will be commissioned the USS Little Rock before deploying to Florida.', 'In addition to automation that has cut crew size in half versus more traditional ships of this size, interchangeable “mission packages,” and a top speed of 40 knots, the close-to-shore warship will tout something else: the ability to vertically launch Hellfire missiles (also made by Lockheed) to target threats on land, sea and in the air.', 'It’s one of the ways Lockheed is looking to make the controversial ship more lethal. It’s a strategy meant to not only silence critics and snag more orders, but better position the top defense contractor for one of the biggest, most-anticipated new Navy contracts.', '“This is a warship,” says Michele Evans, Lockheed’s vice president and general manager of integrated warfare systems and sensors, a multibillion dollar Naval systems portfolio that includes LCS and the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system.', '“It really looks to bring vertical launching systems, take advantage of a lot of what we develop with Aegis, and eventually, we could even look at having a laser-based system on this.', '“So, we see the growth potential and I think there’s a desire as the Navy looks toward a future frigate.”', 'That future frigate is the Navy’s “future guided missile frigate” or FFG(X), a competition for a next-generation small combatant ship to be based off of an existing small surface combatant (like for example, LCS).', 'Last week the Navy released a design request for proposal that’s expected to be awarded next year, the last step before selected contractors build their concepts. Officials met with industry on Friday to review the hundreds of pages of guidelines.', 'The final contract is set to be awarded in 2020, with the program likely to be worth about $15 billion, according to Roman Schweizer, a defense analyst at Cowen. It’s expected to span at least 20 ships.', 'For the Littoral Combat Ship, Lockheed, an LCS co-prime, partners with shipbuilder Fincantieri Marinette Marine and ship designer Gibbs & Cox for its Freedom-class variant.', 'Lockheed says it will “absolutely” bid for the frigate, but with the competition still in early stages and many details unknown, it says potential partners are yet-to-be-determined.', 'It already has company. LCS co-prime Austal has also said it will compete. An Australian company, Austal has a shipyard in Alabama where it currently makes the Independence-class Littoral Combat Ship. Of the 29 ships under contract, Lockheed has 14 and Austal has the rest. (Based on the fiscal 2018 defense bill, three more are expected to be procured, though the breakdown of those orders is unknown.)', 'General Dynamics’ Bath Iron Works has also said it will participate, and analysts expect others like Huntington Ingalls to bid as well.', 'Lockheed and Austal may have some hurdles to mount. The Littoral Combat Ship has seen no shortage of critics, including Senate Armed Services Committee chair John McCain, who has repeatedly slammed it as an example of defense-related waste and inefficiency.', '“Initial cost overruns more than doubled the cost of each LCS, development costs for the ships and their modules now exceed $6 billion dollars, and they keep rising,” the senator said at a hearing in June. “Meanwhile, key warfighting capabilities of the LCS including key mine counter measures and antisubmarine warfare have fallen years, I repeat years, behind schedule and remain unproven.”', 'Responsibility can go around for those challenges, to the contractors but also the Navy itself, which changed criteria even as the earliest ships were being built.', 'For its part, Lockheed Martin says those growing pains are behind it, as production has ramped to full-rate. It now takes about three years from start of fabrication to delivery, explains Joe DePietro, Lockheed’s vice president of small combatants and ship systems, compared to “in excess” of five years for the very first Lockheed LCS called USS Freedom.', 'Also worth noting, while price varies per contract and vessel, a LCS still only costs about $500 million — double the initial target price set in the early 2000s — but still a fraction of the billions spent on a Navy destroyer or cruiser.']"

But it did not give any time frame on how long it will be before it begins to trim its bond purchases.', '“You’ve got an oil tanker. You’ve got to turn the wheel way before, and then the ship starts turning well down the way. That’s what we saw,” said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Mellon.']"
