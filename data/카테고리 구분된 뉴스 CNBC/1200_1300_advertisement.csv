', 'Over the next 30 years, investing $2 trillion to $3.7 trillion globally across several sustainable ocean-based policy interventions would generate a net benefit of $8.2 trillion to $22.8 trillion, according to the report commissioned by the High Level Panel for Sustainable Ocean Economy, a project of 14 world leaders and the United Nations secretary-general’s special envoy for the ocean.', 'The research focuses on investments in four main areas: increasing the production of sustainable protein from the ocean, maintaining mangrove habitats, increasing offshore wind production and decarbonizing international shipping. ', '“When we think about the ocean, we think about the impact of climate change on ecosystems and marine habitats. We think about overfishing [and] ocean pollution,” said Manaswita Konar, lead ocean economist in WRI’s Sustainable Ocean Initiative and a co-author of the report. ', '“But we rarely think about the ocean’s ability to address these challenges and bring about prosperity to the economy,” she said. ', 'Ocean-related industries like offshore wind energy, fishing and shipping comprise roughly 3.5% to 7% of global gross domestic product, a value expected to double by 2030, according to estimates from the WRI. However, the coronavirus pandemic has severely impacted jobs and output from those sectors, and climate change, overfishing and pollution are destroying the ocean’s ability to sustain those sectors.', '“We need to stop thinking about the ocean as just a victim of climate change and start talking more about how ocean-based solutions can help achieve economic recovery post-Covid and build economic resilience into the system,” Konar said. ', 'One solution researchers suggest is investing in ocean-based food production by improving fisheries and the production of ocean aquaculture. ', 'As the global population grows, investing in wild fisheries would help provide healthy diets for people over the next 30 years while replacing carbon emission-intensive land-based proteins like beef and lamb, researchers contended. Every $1 invested in increasing production of sustainably sourced ocean-based protein is estimated to generate $10 in benefits, the report said. ', 'Another solution is investing in mangroves, which are swamp ecosystems typically located in the tropics that connect freshwater and oceanic ecosystems and protect people from sea level rise, hurricanes and flooding. Every $1 invested in mangrove conservation and restoration is estimated to yield a benefit of $3, according to the report. ', '“It is important to protect mangroves as early as possible — early investment is important — to avoid high costs in the future,” said Helen Ding, an environmental economist at the WRI’s Economics Center and a co-author of the report. ', 'Offshore wind farms, which are continuing to expand across the world, are part of a major push to get electricity primarily from renewable sources.', 'While offshore farms generally cost a lot more than power from turbines on land, excitement over offshore wind projects has grown amid climate change fears and advancements in technology have helped lower costs. ', 'Researchers contend that every $1 invested in scaling up global offshore wind production generates a benefit estimated at $2 to $17, depending on the varying cost of production. But the value of the return on investment will likely increase as costs for offshore wind energy generate fall due to improved technology. ', 'Another challenge in the energy sector is international shipping, a major carbon dioxide emitter. The industry accounts for roughly 2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the total cost to decarbonize the sector has been estimated at $1.65 trillion by 2050.', 'Researchers say that every $1 invested in decarbonizing global shipping and reducing carbon emissions to net zero is estimated to generate a return of $2 to $5.', '“The returns are going to be significant in terms of the health benefits we’ll get from reducing greenhouse gases,” Konar said of decarbonzing the shipping industry. “These benefits will prolong beyond 2050.” ', 'Across all the investment areas, researchers estimated the value of benefits with assessments like health, environmental and ecological, water usage and economic and social factors. The categories of costs included assessments like costs to businesses, government and households. ', '“We are going through a financial crisis post-Covid, so there will be questions raised about the financial implications of these investments,” Konar said.', '“But we have sustainable development goals and commitments that we need to achieve, and all these interventions will help us achieve those,” she added. “We are preparing for challenges that the world will face in the future.” ']"

2,Here’s what investors should know about rocket builder Astra as it prepares to go public,2021-02-23T20:44:00+0000,"['Rocket builder Astra is preparing to go public in the second quarter, taking on a crowded field of competitors while aiming for daily deliveries to space by 2025.', 'CEO Chris Kemp spoke to CNBC this month about the company’s plans for its upcoming cash infusion.', 'Once Astra closes its merger with Holicity, a special purpose acquisition company, the venture expects it will have as much as $500 million in capital on hand.', 'That includes a $30 million funding round, previously unreported by media, that the rocket builder closed prior to announcing its SPAC deal.', 'Astra, based in Alameda, California, raised the smaller round to help it “go faster” while the merger awaits regulatory approval, with Holicity’s sponsor Pendrell Corporation and existing investors such as Marc Benioff contributing.', '“We’re actually building a space platform – in much the same way that when Amazon started, they weren’t marketing themselves as a delivery truck company or a warehouse company,” Kemp said. “We’re really trying to solve the problem that our customers have, which is they want to put stuff in space quickly.”', 'Financial backing aside, Astra is entering a field packed with competitors.', 'For starters, its 40-foot-tall rocket puts it in the sub-sector of small launch vehicles – a category of the space industry that analysts and executives estimate has in excess of 100 startups in various stages of development. All those ventures are looking to compete with the small rocket leader Rocket Lab.', 'Astra’s rocket is advertised as capable of carrying up to 100 kilograms to low Earth orbit, for as little as $2.5 million for a dedicated launch. Kemp expects that price point to drop as Astra accelerates to a weekly launch rate in 2023 and beyond.', '“The plan is fully funded to 2025 to get to daily space delivery,” he said.', 'It’s a formidable goal. “You’re talking about nearly a launch a day,” said Ken Herbert, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity.', '“Is it possible theoretically? Yes. But, in basically four years, is one company going to be able to support that kind of schedule? It’s ambitious – nobody’s ever done it.”', '“It doesn’t mean it’s impossible, but everything’s got to go right, even COVID-19 aside,” said Herbert. “And there are other factors in play – if you have an anomaly with any one of these launches than everything else is going to get [delayed]”', 'Astra became the latest private rocket builder to reach space for the first time in December, after its Rocket 3.2 vehicle launched from Alaska.', 'Although the rocket did not reach orbit on that mission, Astra’s leadership viewed the launch as clearing the final hurdles needed to begin commercial service later this year.', 'Astra’s board of directors includes Kemp, co-founder and chief technology officer Dr. Adam London, Advance executive Nomi Bergman and ACME venture capital partner Scott Stanford.', 'Holicity chairman and CEO Craig McCaw is expected to join the board when the merge is complete.', 'The SPAC merger values the rocket company at a $2.1 billion enterprise value. It will list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ASTR when the deal closes.', 'Shares of Holicity have climbed since the deal was announced on Feb. 2, up about 50% since then. The SPAC’s stock has climbed as high as $22.47 a share, but slipped in the past week to trade closer to $16 a share.', 'The company is one of the latest in a series of space ventures that have announced deals to go public through a SPAC in the past few months – alongside BlackSky, AST & Science, and Momentus in the past few months.', 'Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic also went public through a deal with Chamath Palihapitiya’s SPAC in 2019.', 'Astra expects to have as much as $500 million in cash proceeds after the deal. That sum includes $200 million from a “private investment in public equity” or PIPE fundraising round led by BlackRock.', '“We convinced BlackRock, and a whole bunch of other conservative long-only investors, that the economics when you start manufacturing small rockets at scale pretty much cancel out what you get with a giant rocket. You get the same economics when you start making hundreds of rockets every year out of a factory,” Kemp said.', 'As for the $30 million venture funding round that Astra closed prior to announcing the SPAC merger, that effort included a $10 million infusion from Holicity’s sponsors.', 'Astra’s investor presentation disclosed that the company has more than $150 million in contracted revenue from government and commercial customers to launch more than 100 spacecraft.', 'The firm also boasts a $1.2 billion pipeline for future launches, although Kemp caveated that as “kind of squishy stuff” like memorandum of understanding (MOU) agreements.', 'Kemp said Astra is “trying to build a 100-year plan” and last year was “running things lean” during the beginning of the pandemic to complete its rocket development testing.', 'Kemp and London, Astra’s technology chief, are controlling shareholders in the company, together owning about 30% of the company.', 'Both have super-voting shares, which vote 10-to-1 compared to common shares – a common practice for Silicon Valley companies.', '“Companies that are building long-term businesses and founders that are committed to a long-term vision or company don’t let investors take over their company,” Kemp said. “It didn’t happen at Facebook or Google or Amazon, and I think these [are the kind of companies] we aspire to be like.”', 'The company’s risk factors, listed in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, also give investors a sense of what challenges Astra may see as it works toward its goals.', 'Astra highlighted that it has “not yet delivered customer satellites into orbit using any of our launch vehicles or rockets, and any setbacks we may experience during our first commercial launch planned for 2021 and other demonstration and commercial missions could have a material adverse effect on our business.”', 'The marketplace of launching small satellites is another key risk.', 'Astra noted that, while it sees significant growth in the years ahead, the market “is still emerging” and “not well established.” Noting that other companies are building small rockets, and Astra expects “to face intense competition.”', 'Lastly, regulatory delays outside of Astra’s concern are another risk, as the company requires licenses from U.S. regulators like the Federal Aviation Administration for launches.', '“No company has yet conducted licensed launches at the annual rate we are targeting,” Astra said.', 'Astra laid out an aggressive timeline for scaling production and generating revenue, starting with its first commercial launch this summer.', 'Kemp said Astra built four rockets last year and stood up three for launch attempts, although Rocket 3.0 was destroyed after an anomaly on the launchpad. Rocket 3.1 suffered a guidance system issue shortly after liftoff, crashing after the engines were shutdown.', 'The company has a future expansion to complete with the SPAC capital, beginning with more investment in its rocket factory. Astra builds 95% of the rocket in-house from raw materials, and also developed its own software for everything from manufacturing to the launch systems.', '“We’re going to automate the factory itself, so that we can get a consistent output of rockets,” Kemp said.', 'Astra forecasts that it will conduct three launches this year, netting $4 million in revenue. The company aims to begin launching at a monthly rate by the end of 2021 – forecasting 15 launches in 2022.', 'That would effectively match the launch pace Rocket Lab, which has launched 97 satellites on 18 missions to date.', 'The company is targeting a weekly launch rate in 2023, with 55 launches bringing in $206 million in revenue. Astra aims to triple that rate in 2024, with 165 launches and rockets going up twice a week – when the company also expects to turn cash-flow positive.', 'By 2025, Astra aims to be launching almost daily and cross the billion-dollar revenue mark, forecasting $1.12 billion in launch revenue for that year.', 'But, as Kemp noted above, Astra wants to build more than just rockets.', 'The company is working on a cylindrical, disc-shaped “modular spacecraft” so that customers can integrate satellite sensors and technology demonstrations directly into Astra’s rocket.', '“Rockets are always going to be a cylinder, so [a disc is] the perfect form factor to put inside a cylinder, where you don’t waste any volume in the rocket, and then you can stack them,” Kemp said.', 'The practice of “ridesharing” on launches has become common, as small satellites hitch a ride on big rockets to get into space for lower prices. But Kemp says it’s a “nightmare” for those small satellites, as “they all get dumped off in the same place.”', '“That’s the current state of the industry, and it sucks,” he said. “It’s like putting a FedEx truck on a plane and flying it to New York and then driving it back to Los Angeles, and then driving the truck off a cliff.”', 'Instead, Kemp says Astra’s modular spacecraft will allow the company to drop off individual satellites in specific orbits on the same launch.', 'Astra forecast its modular spacecraft business will begin generating revenue in 2022, which it expects will climb to more than $300 million a year by 2025.', 'The other differentiator Astra has from other small rocket builders is minimal and mobile infrastructure required for launches, which Kemp says will become a money-maker as a spaceport service.', '“Our entire system packs into four shipping containers, which we can put on a C-130 Hercules [aircraft], on a truck, on a ship – and we’ve done all of those things already,” Kemp said.', 'Astra’s launch infrastructure requires five employees to unpack, who Kemp says can then prepare the rocket to launch in less than a week.', 'For the Rocket 3.2 launch in December, Kemp noted that one of the five employees Astra had sent to Kodiak, Alaska tested positive for COVID-19. The company quarantined the original team in hotel rooms, chartered a plane and flew up five more people to launch the rocket.', '“All I need is a license from the FAA, we put a fence around a gravel pad, and we launch from there in five days with five people,” Kemp said.', 'The company plans to add spaceports all around the country, Kemp noted, and even in other countries that are U.S. allies.', '“There are 80 space agencies and 75 of them have no way to get to space,” Kemp said.', 'Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.']"
3,"Alaska, in ‘hard-core survival mode,’ is America’s worst state for business in 2021",2021-07-13T12:13:20+0000,"['These are tough times in Skagway, Alaska, population 1,183.', '“We’re in hard-core survival mode,” Mayor Andrew Cremata told CNBC.', 'In a normal summer, the Southeast Alaska town would be teeming with tourists from the cruise ships sailing the Inside Passage. Residents could drive 15 miles up the Yukon Highway into Canada to run their basic errands, or they could hop on a state-run ferry to the next town over, Haines.', 'But this year, the cruise ships have just started running again. Cremata is hoping Skagway will see 100,000 passengers this year; in 2019 they had 1.1 million. The border to Canada remains closed to non-essential traffic, and the ferries, part of the Alaska Marine Highway System, are plagued by budget cuts.', '“Just getting your family down to go see a dentist or doctor, when that becomes burdensome or overly expensive, there’s a point where people have just had it and move away,” Cremata said.', 'Multiply Skagway’s situation by thousands of communities and more than 700,000 Alaskans, and you can begin to understand why The Last Frontier finds itself in last place in CNBC’s 2021 America’s Top States for Business rankings.', 'It is the sixth bottom-state finish for Alaska in 14 years. The state previously achieved the dubious distinction in the first four years of the study between 2007 and 2010, hitting bottom again in 2018.', 'As difficult as the past year has been in this state and across the country, it presented opportunities that Alaska failed to capitalize on.', 'Alaska met the pandemic with the best-funded public health system in the nation, according to the United Health Foundation, spending $289 per person per year. That is more than three times the national average. Earlier this year, the state was setting the pace for Covid-19 vaccinations, even in its most remote regions.', 'As the national economy struggled to regain its footing, Alaska offered a generally business-friendly regulatory climate — its legal system tilts toward business, and the number of state laws and regulations is manageable. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation ranks Alaska’s tax climate the third-best in the country.', 'In Skagway, Mayor Cremata said state and federal officials have been extremely helpful through the crisis.', '“They are always ready and willing not only to engage us as a community, but individual people and business owners in the community. People that were struggling with problems with unemployment and all these kinds of things,” he said.', 'And at a time of social upheaval, Alaska offered its relatively diverse population some strong protections against discrimination.', 'So how did Alaska manage to finish No. 50 again in 2021 despite so many advantages going in? In a word: cost.', 'Cost of Doing Business carries the most weight in this year’s study. As the recovery builds, states are touting low business costs more than any other factor, according to CNBC’s analysis. Alaska is an extremely expensive place to do business.', 'Even Alaska’s competitive tax climate, which earns points for relatively low property taxes and no personal income tax, includes a top corporate tax rate of 9.4%, among the highest in the country.', 'Utility costs are oppressive. Alaskans paid an average of 20.20 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity last year, according to U.S. Department of Energy data, with even higher rates in remote areas. That was second only to Hawaii, and nearly double the national average. Wages are high thanks to the high cost of living, and office and industrial space — which are in short supply — is pricey.', 'Cremata said he is worried about how the price of everything seems to be creeping higher.', '“Everything’s barged in,” he said. “And so, if the cost of fuel goes up, it affects the rates on the barge and that affects the price of your milk and eggs.”', 'Indeed, even that high rate of public health funding may be deceiving, because health care in Alaska is so expensive. An office visit to a doctor in Anchorage averaged more than $206 last year, according to the Council for Community and Economic Research, C2ER. That is more than twice the cost in Phoenix, Arizona.', 'Meanwhile, Alaska’s Covid-19 vaccination rate, once the envy of the nation, has fallen below the national average, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.', 'In March, Alaska became the first state in the nation to make vaccines available to everyone aged 16 and older. Officials theorize that meant those who wanted to be vaccinated were quick to get their shots, leaving vaccine-hesitant residents — many in rural or remote areas — who have proven difficult to convince.', 'Vaccination rates are a metric in the Top States’ Life, Health and Inclusion category, where Alaska finishes No. 19 this year.', 'In addition to its cost issues, Alaska ranks No. 49 in the Top States’ Infrastructure category, above only Maine. It is yet another lost opportunity. Alaska might have been able to use the nation’s move toward remote work to partly offset its inherent infrastructure disadvantages, which include its distance from the rest of the country and its vast size.', 'This year’s Top States study introduced broadband connectivity as an infrastructure metric. But broadband in Alaska is the worst in the nation, according to BroadbandNow Research.', 'In Skagway, Cremata said internet service is cumbersome and expensive.', '“You have to actually have a landline in your house for it to work,” he said. “So, the internet has a pretty substantial price to it, but then you also have a $30 charge because you need a landline for the broadband to work.”', 'According to BroadbandNow, fewer than 61% of Alaskans have access to broadband at all, and none have access to a low-priced plan, which the organization defines as costing less than $60 per month. The average speed is a paltry 58.6 Mbps, or one-third the speed in the top-ranked state, New Jersey.', 'Cremata said that early in the pandemic, when he and other local leaders worried the cruise ships could disappear for five years, they convened a task force to consider ways to reinvent the economy. One of the ideas was to make Skagway an internet hub, but it went nowhere.', '“You’d have to have really fast internet, obviously, because you probably want to have all of your communications done in the cloud, which is pretty much impossible right now in Skagway,” he said.', 'In May, Gov. Mike Dunleavy created a task force to recommend ways to improve connectivity in the state.', '“On the heels of a global pandemic, now more than ever do we see the critical role that the internet plays in nearly every part of life and the importance of good connectivity for every Alaskan,” Dunleavy said in a statement.', 'But it is Alaska’s third broadband task force in the last decade, with little to show for the efforts. It is also unclear whether the state can muster the funding needed to bring its service up to date.', 'In his statement announcing the task force, Dunleavy, a Republican, emphasized the use of federal pandemic relief money to pay for the expansion. And while his administrative order creating the task force also contemplates using state funds, Dunleavy and the state legislature are already locked in a titanic struggle over the budget.', 'This month, Dunleavy vetoed more than $200 million in state spending approved by the legislature, with cuts aimed at everything from tourism marketing to mental health services.', 'Dunleavy also vetoed $8.5 million in funding for Alaska’s ferry system known as the Alaska Marine Highway System, a link to the outside world for communities like Skagway. ', 'And he relentlessly slashed the University of Alaska’s budget, with cuts totaling $70 million over three years. That hurts the state’s ranking in Education, where it finishes No. 47.', 'Hanging over all of Alaska’s business and financial woes is the price of oil, the state’s economic lifeblood. Oil revenues typically account for more than one-third of the state’s budget.', 'Last year, as weak demand during the pandemic pushed oil prices to historic lows, oil production in Alaska fell to its lowest level in more than 40 years, according to the Energy Department.', 'This year, prices have rebounded, but production in Alaska has not. Alaska oil producers face much lower cost competition in the lower 48, as well as an intensifying tug-of-war over federal oil leases. Production through April was down nearly 5% from a year ago.', 'State budget forecasters expect oil production tax revenue will be around $311 million in the 2021 fiscal year that ended on July 1. That would be a 9% increase from 2020, but a 36% decline from the year before.', 'Those kinds of numbers could make it even harder for Alaska to climb out of the cellar next year.', 'Cremata said he hopes the crisis will convince Alaska to think beyond its traditional economic drivers including tourism, fishing and oil.', '“You can’t think backwards. You have to think forwards,” he said. “Perhaps, this is like a chaos-opportunity moment — where there’s chaos, there’s opportunity, so that people in Alaska, who maybe have been relying on things that aren’t as reliable anymore, maybe try to expand towards some different ideas.”', 'Correction: This story was updated to correct that Alaskans paid an average of 20.20 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity last year.']"
4,Singapore is launching a $50 million program to advance research on AI and cybersecurity,2021-07-13T05:22:56+0000,"['SINGAPORE — Singapore plans to invest $50 million in a program to support research on AI and cybersecurity for future communications structures, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced on Tuesday.', 'As part of the Future Communications Research & Development Programme, Singapore plans to set up new communications testbeds in 5G and beyond-5G, support technology development, and build up a local talent pool.', '5G refers to the fifth generation of high-speed mobile internet that aims to provide faster data speeds and more bandwidth to carry growing levels of web traffic. Many new technologies, such as self-driving cars, are underpinned by rapid developments and global deployment of 5G networks. For its part, Singapore plans to have full island-wide standalone 5G coverage by 2025.', 'The program will “support AI and cybersecurity research for next-generation communications infrastructures,” Heng said at the Asia Tech x Singapore conference.', 'It will “support testbeds for innovative pilots, and provide scholarships for those seeking to pursue research in communications.”', 'The program will also aim to build international partnerships and strengthen cross-border collaborations, according to Heng, who is also Singapore’s coordinating minister for economic policies.', 'Singapore will also be launching a digital exchange known as the Singapore Trade Data Exchange, or SGTraDex. It will allow multiple stakeholders — such as logistics players, shippers and buyers — to share valuable information like real-time cargo locations. The information is said to be encrypted and transmitted, without being stored.', 'The initiative is expected to stamp out significant inefficiencies around the movement of goods along the supply chain. For example, logistics and shipping companies would be able to optimize cargo handling and operations.', '“From the pilots so far, SGTraDex has the potential to unlock more than $150 million of value annually for the supply chain ecosystem,” Heng said. It would also speed up the processing of customs clearance, trade financing, insurance and other related activities, he added.', 'SGTraDex is similar to another initiative launched last year called the Singapore Financial Data Exchange, or SGFinDex. It allows users to sign in with their national digital identity to access their consolidated financial data — such as deposits, credit cards, loans and investments — from participating banks and relevant government agencies on a single platform.', 'Heng pointed out that having the ability to allow data to flow securely and seamlessly can help countries unlock the full potential of digitalization.', 'Southeast Asia’s digital economy is fast-growing and its internet sectors are expected to cross $300 billion by 2025, according to an industry report from Google, Temasek Holdings and Bain & Company.', 'The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the push toward digitalization as many businesses, big and small, had to shift their presence online in the face of social restrictions and lockdowns.', '“Just as globalization drove decades of economic growth around the world, I believe the fast-growing digital economy can propel us to a better future,” Heng said.']"
5,Soaring warehouse demand boosts commercial real estate market as office vacancies mount,2021-07-10T15:54:56+0000,"['After ShipBob decided last July to let staffers work from anywhere, the logistics start-up had its landlord erect a wall in the middle of its Chicago headquarters so half the space could be rented out to another company.', 'On March 1, the office reopened at reduced capacity for socially distanced meetings.', 'But while it’s using less office space, ShipBob’s real estate needs have been expanding at a breakneck pace. The company, which provides fulfillment services to online retailers, has more than doubled its warehouse count since mid-2020 to 24 locations today, including four outside the U.S., with plans to reach 35 by the end of 2021.', 'The seven-year-old company is a microcosm of the U.S. commercial real estate market. While office vacancies have soared as employers prepare for a post-Covid future of distributed work, the industrial market is hotter than ever because of a pandemic-fueled surge in e-commerce and increased consumer demand to get more products at Amazon-like speeds.', 'Vacancy rates in industrial buildings are near a record low and new warehouses can’t get built quickly enough to meet the needs of clothing makers, furniture sellers and home appliance manufacturers. Real estate firm CBRE said in its first-quarter report on the industrial and logistics market that almost 100 million square feet of space was absorbed in the period, the third-highest amount ever, and that a record 376 million square feet is under construction.', 'Rents rose 7.1% in the quarter from the same period a year earlier to an all-time high of $8.44 per square foot, CBRE said. The firm wrote in a follow-up report last month that prices in coastal markets near population centers and inland port hubs are soaring by double-digit percentages. In Northern New Jersey, average base rent for industrial properties jumped 33% in May from a year earlier, and California’s Inland Empire saw an increase of 24%, followed by Philadelphia at 20%.', '“The need to have facilities in these markets, coupled with record low vacancy rates, has often led to bidding wars among occupiers that are driving up rental rates,” CBRE said.', 'The wheels were well in motion before Covid-19 hit the U.S. in early 2020. Amazon was already turning next-day delivery into the default option for Prime members, and big box stores like Best Buy and Walmart were racing to add fulfillment space to try and keep pace.', 'The pandemic accelerated everything. Consumers were stuck at home and ordering more stuff, while physical stores had to go digital to stay afloat.', 'Grocery delivery added to the market tightness, as Instacart and Postmates were suddenly inundated with orders from customers who didn’t want to enter a Costco, Albertsons or Kroger store. Instacart is now planning a network of fulfillment centers loaded up with cereal-picking robots, according to Bloomberg, and Target has bolstered same-day fulfillment through so-called sortation centers.', 'In addition to the rapid change in consumer behavior, the pandemic also exposed the fragility of the global supply chain. With facilities in China and elsewhere shuttered, stores experienced dramatic shortages of apparel, car parts and packaging materials.', 'Retailers responded by securing more storage space to mitigate the impact of future shocks, said James Koman, CEO of ElmTree Funds, a private equity firm focused on commercial real estate.', '“The reshoring of manufacturing is gaining momentum,” Koman said. Companies are “bringing more products onshore and need to have room for their products so we don’t fall into another situation like we’re in right now.”', 'All of those factors are contributing to skyrocketing prices, he said. Additionally, construction costs are higher because of inflation and supply constraints, and companies are building more sophisticated facilities, filled with robots.', '“You have these automatic forklifts, conveyor belts, and automated storage retrieval systems,” Koman said. “All this is where the world is going.”', 'Betting on a long-term need for fulfillment and logistics facilities, ElmTree has acquired about $2 billion worth of industrial space over the past seven months, outpacing prior years, Koman said. He estimates the U.S. will need an additional 135-150 million square feet annually to support e-commerce growth.', 'For ShipBob, the e-commerce boom has played right into its business model. But competition for space is simultaneously forcing the company to reckon with higher costs.', 'ShipBob works with brands like perfume company Dossier, powdered energy drink maker Juspy and Tom Brady’s sports and fitness brand TB12, providing a wide network of fulfillment centers for fast and reliable shipping and software to manage deliveries and inventory.', 'Unlike the retail giants, ShipBob doesn’t go after large football field-sized fulfillment centers, and only has leases at a few of its facilities. Rather, it looks for warehouses that are typically family-owned with 75,000-100,000 square feet and some unused capacity. It then outfits them with ShipBob technology and pays based on order volume and the amount of space it uses.', 'While ShipBob isn’t signing leases, it is competing for space in warehouses that are now sitting on much more valuable property than they were a year ago. ShipBob CEO Dhruv Saxena said that his company has to be in areas like Southern California and Louisville, Kentucky, a major transportation and logistics hub, despite the rapid increase in prices.', '“We have to find ways of placing inventory closer to the end customer even if it comes at a lower margin for us,” Saxena said in an interview late last month after his company raised $200 million at a valuation topping $1 billion.', 'ShipBob competes directly with a number of fulfillment outsourcing start-ups, including ShipMonk, Deliverr and Shippo. Those four companies have raised almost $900 million combined in the past year.', 'Saxena said a major reason smaller retailers turn to ShipBob is to avoid the costs and hassle of finding fulfillment space and hiring the requisite workers.

Whether they reap the benefits of physical stores could shape the path ahead for other online-first companies.', 'The two businesses have become synonymous with the term “direct-to-consumer” in the retail industry. The strategy involves avoiding wholesale channels, such as department stores, to forge stronger relationships with customers. DTC companies have few or no brick-and-mortar locations.', 'Dozens — if not hundreds — of brands have debuted and labeled themselves in the DTC category in recent years. Products range from makeup and pajamas to toothbrushes and deodorants.', 'As Warby Parker and Allbirds prepare to make their respective public market debuts, they’ve entered a fresh expansion phase with aggressive goals. Investors and analysts will hold them accountable.', 'The success of their next moves, including the planned rollout of more physical stores, will likely carry implications for the brands following in their footsteps.', 'For one, both businesses lose money. It’s unclear when — if ever — they’ll become profitable. Allbirds’ net loss totaled $14.5 million in 2019 and grew to $25.9 million in 2020.', 'Warby Parker broke even in 2019, and its net loss last year was $55.9 million.', 'While opening up stores comes with added fixed costs, brick-and-mortar retail remains the best channel to find new customers.

In the latter, shares are not taken public by a team of underwriters.', 'An online-only model is only sustainable for so long, experts say. The success or failure of these companies’ public debuts could fuel additional IPOs or lead retail companies that have followed a DTC model to look to other exit strategies.', '“There was this early euphoria that there was a new model where you didn’t need stores anymore,” said Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at advertising firm Publicis. “Like stores and the traditional business model was all old school, and the new way of doing things was going directly to the consumer ... slapping up a website and inventing a cool product.”', 'Companies are figuring out the model is not sustainable, Goldberg said.', '“There’s a certain phase of your infant growth where you can achieve success without stores, and it can be really easy to acquire customers,” he said. “But no digitally native brand has achieved a billion dollars in annual revenue without a store. You need those stores as a cost-effective customer acquisition channel at some point.”', 'Emory University assistant marketing professor Dan McCarthy keeps tabs on companies such as Casper Sleep, Figs, Revolve and Peloton as he monitors Warby Parker and Allbirds.

It’s further evidence of a company initially fueled by web sales seeing the benefits of real estate.', 'Allbirds, the sustainable shoe brand that got its start in Silicon Valley, said it has “just scratched the surface” of its potential to open stores, particularly in the United States.', 'The company counted 27 retail locations globally as of June 30, according to an SEC filing.', '“As our store fleet expands, we expect our growth to accelerate, as compared to 2020,” Allbirds said. “We believe our new stores will also be highly profitable, have attractive payback periods, serve as good capital investments, and be positioned well to take advantage of physical retail’s recovery from the pandemic.”', 'The company said e-commerce accounted for 89% of total sales last year, and stores made up the rest. Its brick-and-mortar shops were shut for weeks in 2020 due to the Covid crisis. Through June 30, shoppers who visited both a physical location and the website spent 1.5-times more money than a customer who only went to a store or shopped online alone, Allbirds said.', 'The company pointed to its Boston Back Bay location to show the benefits of opening a shop. In the three months after the store’s debut in March 2019, web traffic in the area rose 15%. The company saw 83% more new customers in the neighborhood.', 'To leverage the benefits of stores, companies may not need to target expensive markets like New York City or Los Angeles.

Rapid expansion has gotten companies in trouble in the past and pushed numerous businesses into bankruptcy court to get out of leases.', '“It used to be all about malls,” Green said. “You could figure out a mall strategy and put up 200, 400 stores. ... Now, I just think we flip that equation, and the initial driver is building the presence online.”', 'For the likes of Warby Parker and Allbirds, the benefits of opening up more stores come with higher fixed costs and the liability of a lease.', 'But many businesses have found ways to manage those costs.

Target leverages its stores, in turn, to lower costs associated with shipping and transportation.', '“You can build a business of a certain size online,” Green said. “But the reality is, if you really have scale in mind, you are going to need to think about meeting the customer where the customer is. And they are in a lot of different places.”', 'Warby Parker and Allbirds have decided they need to expand their offerings to move toward profitability. The success of their public debuts will have implications for other companies that followed their online-first model, according to Publicis’ Goldberg.', '“It’s a positive affirmation for the model that this first class [of DTC brands] is starting to get exits, because so far there have been some good acquisitions ... but the market wasn’t very ripe for these IPOs,” he said.', '“Now that the market is starting to seemingly tolerate some of these ideas — and especially if they’re successful with these unit economics — that’s going to evolve into a whole second wave of digitally native companies trying to follow in those footsteps,” he said.']"

It’s my first,” Dell said on “Squawk on the Street,” referring to the 1918 flu pandemic. Katz’s, initially founded in 1888, moved to its current location on Houston Street a year before that health crisis began.', 'For this pandemic, which has devastated the restaurant industry, Dell said he’s using a “make-it-up-as-you-go” approach.', '“Make the best decision we can in the moment without losing touch with the nostalgia and tradition that’s truly at the core of Katz’s,” said Dell, a fifth-generation owner.', 'While the pandemic is not yet over, Dell said lessons Katz’s has learned in the past 11 months will help the deli succeed in the decades ahead, such as website development. Strategic decisions Katz’s made in the years preceding the coronavirus crisis have helped keep it afloat, too, he said.', 'Dell’s comments came as limited indoor dining at New York City restaurants was set to resume after Gov. Andrew Cuomo paused it indefinitely in mid-December. Some health experts have questioned the timing, citing new coronavirus variants that are believed to be more transmissible. But for many in the city’s dining industry, the resumption of indoor dining is being cheered as a much-needed way to boost revenue during the bitter winter.', 'Katz’s will have about 17 or 18 tables available to comply with the 25% capacity restriction, Dell said. The deli will revert to the health protocols it used during the fall when the city permitted indoor dining, he said.', 'Dell acknowledged Katz’s is fortunate because its dining room size makes 25% capacity more sustainable than it is for smaller restaurants. From a business standpoint, it’s hard for most eateries to get by with only a quarter of tables being available, Dell said.', '“One thing that we focused on really hard was our website and focusing on bringing the customer experience to your door, the true Katz’s experience. You can’t make it to the Lower East Side, so how do we bring it to you?” said Dell, who joined the restaurant in 2009. His father, Alan, was involved before him.', 'Fortunately, Katz’s experience shipping food across the U.S. dates to World War II, when its slogan, “Send a salami to your boy in the Army,” was coined, Dell said. But when the pandemic hit last spring — grinding New York tourism to halt and shutting down indoor dining — Katz’s really had to scale up its logistics operation.', 'That meant retraining some employees, like dishwashers, on how to properly pack mustard, pickles and knishes so the food can be shipped throughout the country, Dell said. “And that has grown tremendously and we really hope that continues once all is back to normal.”', 'As for local delivery, Dell said Katz’s built its own network a few years ago to avoid having to pay an “egregious” fee to third-party providers, such as DoorDash and Uber Eats. “We just bit the bullet and built a giant [delivery] factory a couple years ago and it’s paid off,” Dell said. “We’ve been lucky. We haven’t actually laid anyone off during this pandemic, and I’m pretty grateful for that.”', 'Katz’s received a loan through the Paycheck Protection Program worth $1 million to $2 million, according to a database compiled by nonprofit journalism site ProPublica. The loan was approved May 3 and helped retain 143 jobs, the database shows.', 'Asked why Dell fought to keep Katz’s open during the depths of the pandemic, he said: “Because you have to. You put your head down and you go forward. You take it one decision at a time.”', '“When the pandemic started, we immediately started giving out soups to ... low income and senior citizen buildings in the neighborhood. We’ve served, I think, something like 30,000 meals, all five boroughs, to over 30 hospitals to front-line workers,” Dell added, saying Katz’s felt obligated to help as a family-run business. “The community takes care of you.

As it turns out, the industries make for compatible bedfellows.', 'Just take Hayden Griffin Haby III, an oilman turned bitcoiner. The Texas native and father of three has spent 14 years in oil and gas, and he epitomizes what this monthly meetup is all about.

But for the last nine months, he’s exclusively been in the business of mining bitcoin.', 'As Haby describes it, he was “orange pilled” in November 2020 – a term used to describe the process of convincing a fiat-minded person that they are missing out by not investing in bitcoin. A month later, he co-founded Limpia Creek Technologies, which powers bitcoin mining rigs with flared, vented, and stranded natural gas assets.', '“When I heard that you could make this much money per MCF (a metric used to measure natural gas), instead of just burning it up into the atmosphere, thanks to the whole ‘bitcoin mining thing,’ I couldn’t look away,” Haby said. “You can’t unsee that.”', 'When China kicked out all its crypto miners this spring – an exodus which Haby calls the “Chexit” – that poured kerosene on the flames. “This is an opportunity we didn’t think was coming,” he said.', 'Haby tells CNBC they are already seeing demand rushing to Texas, and he is convinced that the state is poised to capture most of the Chinese hashrate looking for a new home on friendlier shores.', 'Bitcoin miners care most about finding cheap sources of electricity, so Texas – with its crypto-friendly politicians, deregulated power grid, and crucially, abundance of inexpensive power sources – is a virtually perfect fit. The union becomes even more harmonious when miners connect their rigs to otherwise stranded energy, like natural gas going to waste on oil fields across Texas.', '“This is Texas, boys. We got what you need, so come on down,” said Haby. “We are sitting on the energy capital of the world.”', '“I think Kevin Costner said it best: ‘If you build it, they will come,’” said Haby.', 'Parker Lewis is one of Texas’ de facto bitcoin ambassadors.

Whereas oil can easily be trucked out to a remote destination, gas delivery requires a pipeline.  ', 'If a drilling site is right next door to a pipeline, they chuck the gas in and take whatever cash the buyer on the other end is willing to pay that day. “There’s no choice. There’s no middle finger. Whatever gas comes out that day has to be sold,” explained Haby.', 'But if it’s 20 miles from a pipeline, things start to get more complicated.

If a driller can’t immediately find a way to sell the stash of natural gas, most look to dispose of it on site.', 'One method is to vent it, which releases methane directly into the air – a poor choice for the environment, as its greenhouse effects are shown to be much stronger than carbon dioxide. A more environmentally friendly option is to flare it, which means actually lighting the gas on fire. ', '“Chemistry is amazing,” explained Adam Ortolf, who heads up business development in the U.S. for Upstream Data, a company that manufactures and supplies portable mining solutions for oil and gas facilities. ', '“When CH4, or methane, combusts, the only exhaust is CO2 and H2O vapor. That’s literally the same thing that comes out of my mouth when I exhale,” continued Ortolf.', 'But Ortolf points out, flares are only 75 to 90% efficient. “Even with a flare, some of the methane is being vented without being combusted,” he said.', 'This is when on-site bitcoin mining can prove to be especially impactful.', 'When the methane is run into an engine or generator, 100% of the methane is combusted and none of it leaks or vents into the air, according to Ortolf. ', '“But nobody will run it through a generator unless they can make money, because generators cost money to acquire and maintain,” he said. “So unless it’s economically sustainable, producers won’t internally combust the gas.”', 'Bitcoin makes it economically sustainable for oil and gas companies to combust their methane rather than externally combust it with a flare. ', '“There is no such thing as stranded gas anymore,” said Haby.', 'But Ortolf has taken years to convince people that parking a trailer full of ASICs on an oil and gas field is a smart and financially sound idea.', '“In 2018, I got laughed out of the room when I talked about mining bitcoin on flared gas,” said Ortolf. “The concept of bringing hydrocarbons to market without a counterparty was laughable.”', 'Fast forward three years, and business at Upstream, a company founded by lead engineer Steve Barbour, is booming. It now works with 140 bitcoin mines across North America.', '“This is the best gift the oil and gas industry could’ve gotten,” said Ortolf. “They were leaving a lot of hydrocarbons on the table, but now, they’re no longer limited by geography to sell energy.” ', 'It is also helping to curtail the overall carbon footprint of some of these oil and gas sites. Recent production stats show that in the U.S. alone about 1.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas is wasted on a daily basis. And these are just the reported numbers, so the actual figures are likely higher.', 'Meanwhile, bitcoin miners get what they want most: cheap electricity. ', 'The thing about all these grand visions for bitcoin mining – to stay the course, it requires some manpower on Capitol Hill to safeguard its plan to scale. And right now, politicians in Washington are scrambling to figure out what and how to regulate cryptocurrencies and all the ancillary services that make up the wider ecosystem for digital currencies. ', 'That’s why another big topic of conversation at the Houston Bitcoin Meeting was political activism.', '“Who knows a staffer or a representative?” one member of the crowd posed to the group. At least half a dozen people raised their hands and one stepped up to confirm they would reach out to their contact in Senator Cruz’s office.', 'There was a sense of momentum in the audience. Several people made the point that the bitcoin contingent across the country had paralyzed a $1 trillion rubber-stamped, bipartisan bill, no small feat for a voting bloc which hitherto hadn’t been viewed as much of a threat on the Hill.', 'But it’s not just about being on the defensive for these tens of millions of voters and bitcoin faithful. They’re going on the offensive by working to install like-minded people into office so that they can do something “before they do it to us,” as one member of the audience said to the group. They’re also teaching veteran lawmakers about bitcoin, as many representatives don’t understand it.', '“We need to target anyone who is anti-bitcoin. There are 45 million of us in America, and we are not silent,” said this same attendee.']"

Other retailers, like Macy’s and Kohl’s, have raised prices to keep up with the uptick in costs.    ', 'But resale companies The RealReal and ThredUp are playing up their secondhand supply chains, inventory levels, and pricing.   ', '“While many retailers have been forced to raise prices due to inflation or supply chain pressure, we do not have the same level of exposure,” James Reinhart, CEO of ThredUp, said on the company’s recent third quarter earnings call.  ', 'ThredUp’s business is entirely sourced domestically from its users, according to Reinhart, and has no reliance on direct manufacturing for inventory.  ', '“We have chosen to strategically lower prices in order to engage as many customers as possible during a time when consumers are feeling price pressure in many other parts of their life,” he added.  ', 'ThredUp’s prices averaged 15% lower in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Reinhart said the company will continue to keep prices down through ThredUp’s domestic supply system.

RealReal received a boost from its recent earnings, but remains down near-25% this year.', 'But the broader consumer trends supporting the secondhand market do continue to serve as a secular tailwind for the niche.', 'In total, by 2023, the secondhand and resale market is expected to reach $53 billion, according to the latest annual forecast from ThredUp, with $27 billion in resale and $26 billion in traditional secondhand (thrift and donation).', 'Carolyn Thompson, president and CEO of Aravenda, a consignment software company, noted that the resale industry is growing 11 times faster than traditional retail, citing ThredUp data.

And for the younger shopper who is looking for retro styles and a sustainable way to shop, “it is a viable way to have an exchange with a retailer or a brand,” he added.  ', 'The sustainability factor is an “added perk” for Elliott, but the main reason he shops resale is for the exclusiveness and online convenience.

In April, StockX completed a new round of funding that valued it at $3.8 billion, signaling the “broad recognition and excitement” for the company in the long-term, StockX CEO Scott Cutler said in a statement.  ', 'Through resale sites like Depop, consumers can resell limited items that may have sold out and are no longer available directly from the retailer – a common occurrence, according to Elliott, “so, it’s hard not to buy off a resale site.”  ', '“When you pivot over and look at the RealReal, a lot of that relationship with the customer is on luxury or higher-end goods,” Ceci said.  ', 'Several traditional retailers are finding ways to move into the reselling space as that business booms.  ', 'Lululemon announced in April it would be launching its own resale program. The brand partnered with Trove, a business that helps companies build out resale shops, and began piloting its ‘Like New’ program in California and Texas in May.

', 'The tanker, which was described in a recent op-ed from The Atlantic Council as a “floating bomb,” is thought to be eroding fast. ', 'There are concerns that following years of inertia in a salty and corrosive maritime environment, volatile gases have built up in the storage tanks — increasing the risk of an explosion.

', 'Matt Lowcock, the UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said in a speech to the Security Council last week that Houthi authorities “continue to delay” any assessment of the tanker. ', 'Lowcock pointed out that this was “additionally frustrating” because Houthi authorities had actually contacted the UN in early 2018 requesting assistance with the tanker and promising to facilitate their work.

However, large-scale freezers units are expensive — and with hospital budgets already strained during the pandemic, dry ice has emerged as the go-to option.', 'That’s how Chris Vida, owner of Dry Ice Depot, described what he’s seeing right now.', 'Vida’s business — located in Bridgewater, New Jersey — ships on average 40,000 to 50,000 pounds of dry ice per day. He told CNBC that new orders continue to pour in from hospitals that will have to store their Pfizer vaccine supplies at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit. ”[Tuesday] was a big day, we moved around 70,000 pounds of dry ice. So our inventory is a little shot. We’ve ramped up double our normal volume at this point.”', 'The average dry ice order amount from hospitals is 170 pounds, Vida said, adding that he’s also receiving big orders from pharmacies and shipping giants like FedEx.', 'Distributors and suppliers across the nation are dealing with a similar situation in preparation of the vaccine receiving emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. Limited approval could be given this week after the agency’s vaccines committee meets Thursday.', 'Acme Dry Ice in Boston, one of the largest distributors of dry ice in the nation, told CNBC that it’s team plans to work over the holidays to ensure he can fulfill the new orders that are coming in. “There is no sleep for the vaccine or the Covid virus,” said Marc Savenor, president of Acme Dry Ice.', 'Unlike the ice in your home refrigerator, dry ice is a solid form of carbon dioxide, or CO2. Back in March, fewer cars on the road due to the pandemic contributed to a decline in ethanol production, which produces CO2 as a by-product, resulting in a shortage of the gas. Experts said that driving ultimately returned over the summer and CO2 supplies, in turn, have rebounded.', 'Rich Gottwald, president of the Compressed Gas Association, told CNBC the industry is confident there’s enough CO2 product to meet demand for the vaccine. CGA is a trade body representing the biggest CO2 suppliers and dry ice manufacturers. “The shortage that we saw in the spring was really alleviated by the end of the day, by driving coming back over the summer. [Companies] are ready to supply dry ice as soon as the vaccine comes available,” he added.', 'The industrial and chemical companies involved in the production of CO2 and dry ice are not the most high-profile names. Airgas, part of Air Liquide, supplies dry ice. Continental Carbonic, part of Matheson, is another supplier. Germany’s Linde acquired U.S. based Praxair in 2018 for more than $80 billion. Linde, along with Air Products, supply CO2, which is then converted into dry ice by their customers.', 'One of the key challenges with dry ice is that, unlike toilet paper, it can’t stockpiled.', '“Over time dry ice will revert back to its gaseous form, whether that be five, seven, 10 days, it certainly has a lifespan,” Gottwald explained. “At that point, if it’s being used for a vaccine, the product would need to be re-iced .. more ice would be needed to be applied to the vaccine to keep it at that temperature.”', 'It’s one of the key reasons hospitals are looking to set up longstanding contracts with Vida at Dry Ice Depot in New Jersey: To ensure they can come back for refills when they run out. Vida said that one of the hospitals he’s supplying dry ice to is St. Barnabas Hospital in The Bronx in New York City.', 'While hospitals figure out how many vaccines doses they will be allotted, the staff is puzzled over how much dry ice they will need to keep the Pfizer vaccine at the proper temperature. “Now all the questions are starting and, you know, there’s a lot of confusion out there. People really don’t know how its going to be stored, how we’re going to ship. How much do we [hospitals] need,” said Vida.', 'Medical workers and nurse technicians immunizing citizens will also have to learn how to handle dry ice at such fridge temperatures. Experts said that protective gear is needed to avoid frostbite — and if too much is inhaled, it can become a serious health risk.', 'Forensics Detectors — a small business based in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, which specializes in monitoring toxic gases like CO2 — has also seen sales skyrocket. “My sales have increased over 10 times over the past three months, owner Dr. Kos Galatsis told CNBC. “We are sold out of carbon dioxide detectors.”', 'Companies that make ultra-cold freezers also are experiencing a surge in demand.', 'In late November, Dan Hensler, vice president of Cincinnati-based So-Low Environmental Equipment, said the company was “out of everything” despite its efforts to build up an inventory backlog. “It’s been crazy. It’s absolutely been crazy,” he told CNBC then.', 'Carrier and Trane Technologies — both of which specialize in cold storage options from trucks to freezers — told CNBC they’re actively working with Operation Warp Speed, the White House’s public-private program to accelerate the development, manufacturing and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments.', 'CORRECTION: This article was updated to correct the spelling of the company name Forensics Detectors.', '— CNBC’s Patrick Manning and Kevin Stankiewicz contributed to this story.']"

A worldwide drop in its staple air shipments business combined with an acceleration in residential deliveries have both undermined revenue and hiked costs.', 'The damage is slowly being magnified as e-commerce goliath Amazon transitions from a FedEx customer to a competitor, complete with its own warehousing and an armada of suburban delivery vans.

However, the analyst’s bullish thesis remains very much intact.', 'In line with his optimistic approach, Wong kept a Buy rating on the website building and hosting company. Although he trimmed the price target from $70 to $60, this still leaves room for a 40% gain over the next year.', 'Digging deeper into the print, Squarespace posted revenue and billings of $196 million (a 31% year-over-year increase) and $206 million (a 24% year-over-year gain), respectively. Both results beat the Street’s $189 million and $200 million calls. Additionally, Presence and Commerce revenue surpassed Wong’s estimates. It should also be noted that most of the increase in take rate came from Tock’s contribution, which Squarespace acquired earlier this year.', '“Management also highlighted better cash retention this year, which should stave off concerns that pandemic subscription cohorts could see elevated churn as economies normalize,” the analyst added.', 'That being said, Wong believes the “flattish Q3 trajectory likely to disappoint investors.” For the full year, the company actually bumped up its revenue outlook by $6 million at the midpoint from a range of $764 million to $776 million to a range of $772 million to $780 million.', '“We believe the increase would have been just ‘good enough’ in a vacuum. However, we expect investors to scrutinize the Q3 revenue outlook guide ($193-198 million, 19-22%), which projects for a modest sequential decline at the mid-point and falls ~$2 million below consensus estimates ($197.5 million). Management emphasized a prudent approach to outlook due to the uncertain macro and health climate. Investors we caught up with were understanding of the volatile demand environment, but felt the lack of specificity around which business segments and KPIs magnified the confusion,” Wong explained.', 'Long-term, though, Wong is standing in the bull camp. “We remain positive on SQSP’s long-term opportunity to enable digital commerce… We expect a more thoughtful growth roadmap at the company’s inaugural Analyst Day in November. Following the noisy outlook, we expect investors to home in on the commentary around revenue mix shift, additional monetization/take rate opportunities, details surrounding the Tock acquisition and integration and other potential long-term growth accelerators,” he commented.       ', 'Currently, Wong is tracking a 68% success rate and 27.1% average return per rating.', 'Following The Trade Desk’s second-quarter earnings call, Needham’s Laura Martin tells investors that there are “several upside value drivers we’ve underestimated, until now.”', 'In accordance with her optimistic stance, the five-star analyst reiterated a Buy rating on the media-buying platform provider. Additionally, Martin left the $100 price target as is, which implies 21% upside potential.', 'What exactly are these value upside drivers? First and foremost, Martin points to TTD’s Unified ID 2.0 solution. According to the analyst, this solution is “less about replacing Cookies and more about creating a targeting and measurement competitive advantage for the Open Internet versus Walled Gardens.”', 'Expounding on this, Martin stated, “TTD is trying to roll out Unified ID 2.0 into CTV targeting, and all other digital advantage channels, and then to convince advantage buyers that unduplicated reach and data granularity is much better in the Open Internet than from Walled Gardens such as Amazon, Google/ YouTube, Facebook, Roku, etc. Finally, TTD believes Unified ID has reached ‘critical mass,’ (our estimate is 150-200 million consumers) implying every company must accept Unified ID targeting.”', 'On top of this, Video revenue of $106 million made up 38% of the total Q2 revenue. Of this, $84 million, or 80%, was CTV.  ', '“TTD believes that the 79 million households in the U.S. that advertisers can reach using CTV ad units is larger than total linear TV homes… CTV revenues grew faster than 101% total revenue growth year-over-year. CTV consortiums like Open AP are making their targeting IDs comparable with Unified ID 2.0 as are some CTV owners directly, such as FUBO,” Martin said.', 'What’s more, Martin highlights the fact that its deal with Walmart adds shopper marketing total addressable market of $100 billion to TTD’s revenue in 2022, with the data integration still on track for completion in the fourth quarter of 2021.', 'It should be noted, though, that Walmart doesn’t pay TTD a revenue share, but rather, “TTD makes money from Walmart deal by attracting shopper marketing ad budget (TTD has ZERO of these today) from CGP advertisers that want to move products on shelves at Walmart.”', '“This is 100% a new TAM for TTD. TTD will charge its normal 20% take rate on this new revenue stream. Walmart is trying to mirror AMZN, which reported $7.3 billion of shopper marketing advantage revenues in Q2 2021,” Martin explained.', 'Achieving a 63% success rate and 26.2% average return per rating, Martin is ranked #130 out of over 7,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks.', 'Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch sees Plug Power as “leading the hydrogen ecosystem scale-up.” As such, the top analyst reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. At $62, Rusch’s price target suggests that 126% upside potential could be in store.', '“With PLUG delivering upside to Q2 2021 revenue expectations and raising 2021 revenue guidance, we believe the company is making sound decisions as it lays the foundation for growth of hydrogen as a transportation fuel. We believe expenses related to swapping out Air Products equipment in its hydrogen fuel supply chain as well as PLUG paying force majeure expenses builds strong customer loyalty and will help the company grow partnerships for hydrogen off-take agreements and vehicles,” Rusch said.', 'Leading up to the company’s Hydrogen Symposium, it revealed its estimated output and updated construction progress for the Rochester facility.', '“Leveraging automation, scale, and a seasoned leadership team, we believe PLUG can achieve significant product cost improvement at production scale. Management noted equipment is currently being installed, and expects to ship 250MW of electrolyzers out of the factory in 2021,” the analyst said.  ', 'Notably, this month, PLUG started working on its third green hydrogen plant, with this “expanding its reach to cover the majority of the eastern U.S./I-95 corridor,” said Rusch. As the combined production capacity will accelerate to 75 tons per day between the three plants, the analyst argues “this footprint provides critical scale for enabling commercial vehicle fuel cell adoption.”', 'Taking all of this into consideration, PLUG bumped up its guidance for FY21 gross billings from $475 million to $500 million, with the consensus estimate landing at $474 million. In addition, the company is calling for bookings of 250-500 MW of electrolyzers.', 'Ranked #10 on TipRanks’ list, Rusch boasts a 64% success rate and 65% average return per rating.', 'BTIG analyst Mark Palmer believes that investor focus should be landing on Verra Mobility. With this in mind, he reiterated a Buy rating and $19 price target, suggesting 18% upside potential.', 'Palmer acknowledges that the company’s Commercial Services segment, which provides automated tolling solutions to rental car companies (RACs), was “one of the most severely impacted businesses” in his coverage universe as a result of the COVID-19-related travel restrictions. That being said, given the company’s sufficient liquidity, its ability to generate free cash flow despite lower revenue and the revenue from the school speed zone camera installations in New York City during the pandemic, VRRM shares stabilized.', 'The tide appears to be turning though. Palmer said, “Now, VRRM’s Commercial Services segment is the primary driver of a reopening play that appears to be coming into sharper focus. The segment’s emphatic rebound during Q2 2021 enabled the company to post significant top- and bottom-line beats versus consensus estimates, spurring its stock price higher during today’s extended trading session. With management noting that the segment’s tolling volumes remained below pre-pandemic levels, the strong implication was that it would have ample room for additional upside as the pandemic’s impact on travel continues to abate.”', 'During the second quarter, the Commercial Services business delivered a surprisingly impressive performance. Revenue for the quarter came in at $66.5 million, a 144% gain from the year-ago quarter. In addition, adjusted EBITDA was almost $43 million, reflecting a 64% segment margin.', 'What was behind this strong showing? According to management, it was the recovery in leisure travel, which “arrived faster than they had anticipated due to the vaccine rollout and economic reopening as the reasons for the segment’s eye-popping results.”', 'Based on the solid second-quarter earnings results and favorable macro trends, the company brought back its full year 2021 financial guidance that was suspending due to the pandemic. Management is calling for total revenue of $510 million to $530 million, including the contribution from the Redflex acquisition, which closed in June.', 'Delivering a 66% success rate and 21.1% average return per rating, Palmer is among the top 150 analysts tracked by TipRanks.', 'Although Stifel analyst Scott Devitt sees a “minor marketing issue,” he thinks there is a “major market opportunity” for Poshmark. ', '“We continue to view Poshmark as the best positioned player in the resale eCommerce landscape, with an asset-light and easily extendable business model supporting attractive long-term margins,” Devitt said.', 'To this end, Devitt left his bullish call on Poshmark unchanged. Even though the analyst slightly reduced the price target from $50 to $48, the upside potential still lands at 75%.', 'In the most recent quarter, Poshmark posted GMV of $450 million, rising 25% year-over-year and beating Devitt’s $439 million call. Revenue clocked in at $81.8 million, also exceeding the analyst’s estimate of $81 million. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA of $6.1 million easily beat Devitt’s $2.4 million forecast as marketing spend going into the quarter was lower-than-expected.', 'It should be noted that in the second quarter, changes to IDFA policy, which increased mobile advertising costs, affected the company. Management, however, believes these impacts will normalize throughout the rest of the year.', 'On top of this, Poshmark revealed that it is planning to expand its platform to India. Weighing in on this move, Devitt stated, “India is an attractive eCommerce growth market, with approximately 622 million active internet users and an increasingly active Gen Z and Millennial demographic, with strong resale momentum. On the call management continued to highlight international expansion as a key strategy to grow GMV and active users, and stated it will expand to new English-speaking countries (most likely the U.K., in our view) in the coming quarters.”', 'Reflecting another positive, Poshmark released a new integration within Snapchat called Poshmark Mini, enabling users to go to Posh Parties, shop Poshmark’s whole catalogue and engage with brands that have the most buzz on the platform.', 'The company also made several other improvements to the platform, including the addition of Style Tags to help with search, discovery and categorization as well as Price Suggester functionality to strengthen new seller efficacy.', 'The #34 best-performing analyst on Wall Street has achieved a 70% success rate and 34.8% average return per rating.

It will cost $30, and ship later this year.', '“You never have to worry about daylight savings,” Limp said. “The motor will automatically change.”', 'Alexa Guard. Amazon also moved further into the security space.', 'Alexa Guard will take your Echo, smart lights and security service provider, if you have one, and sync them all together. Users could say, “Alexa, I’m leaving,” and the product will move all your Echo-linked devices into guard mode. Other smart alerts include away lighting mode, where smart lights will intelligently randomize lighting to make it look like someone is home. Alexa Guard will be integrated with Ring and home alarm company ADT to begin.', 'Security cameras. The company also announced new Ring stick-up security cameras, which come in wired and wireless versions. Each will be available for $179.99 later this year.', 'Fire TV Recast. A Fire TV Recast allows users to get over-the-air TV channels, which can be viewed on Echo Show, Echo Spot, Fire TV, iOS, Android and on-the-go outside the home.

The Echo Link will be available for $199 later this year, and the Echo Link Amp for $299 early next year.', 'The Sub will ship this month for $129.99, and pre-orders begin Thursday.', 'Integration with third-party devices. Echo products are expanding to work with other devices. A new Echo Input will give Alexa capabilities to existing speakers, microphones and Bluetooth devices. Amazon will sell the product with partners, including Bose, for $34.99.', 'An Alexa Connect Kit will allow the smart assistant to be added to other devices made by third parties. P&G and Hamilton Beach are among the partners.', 'New Alexa capabilities. Thursday’s announcements also included new abilities for Alexa. It will soon be able to understand when a person is whispering and will reply in a whisper.', 'The company will also add more podcasts for kids as part of Kids FreeTime for Alexa, as well as more than 1,000 Audible audiobooks for children.', 'A new skill called Alexa Hunches allows Alexa to combine routine things that a user often asks for into one command. For example, if you tell Alexa “good night” and the command usually turns off the lights, Alexa will also check other “good night”-related features, including seeing if your doors are unlocked. It will then make other recommendations based on its “hunches.”', 'In addition, Amazon is making it easier to set up devices by allowing users to save all network configurations online through a feature called WiFi simple setup. A new device will boot up, acknowledge previously recorded settings and set itself up. The ability to integrate with third-party devices will be added soon.', 'Note: CNBC parent company NBCUniversal is an investor in Hulu.']"

34,Chewy founder: We’re no Pets.com,2019-07-26T18:46:46+0000,"['In his most recent letter to investors, David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital wrote that today’s market bears resemblance to the tech bubble of 2000. He then compared Chewy, the company I founded in 2011 and ran as CEO until last year, to the ill-fated Pets.com.', 'I am no stranger to the Pets.com comparison. I heard it when I first started the business and again from nearly every venture capital firm I spoke with on Sandhill Road in Silicon Valley. After building Chewy for 8 years with a talented and dedicated management team, upon reading Einhorn’s comments I felt compelled to defend the business we built. The comparison to Pets.com is not only off-base but it does a great disservice to all the hard work the incredible people at Chewy have done over the years to build the world’s largest online pet retailer with more than 11 million loyal customers.', 'Since crashing and burning less than two years after its formation in 1999, Pets.com has served as the symbol for the capital markets’ excesses of the era. The company was fast growing, structurally unprofitable, and paid for sales by overspending on advertising.', 'Simply comparing the relative market capitalization and absolute cash burn does little without understanding the scale advantage, unit economics, and the inherent attractiveness of Chewy’s business model over its predecessor.', 'Mr. Einhorn’s primary complaint seems to be that Chewy is valued at 30 times what Pets.com was at its peak, claiming this as a reason for skepticism. He makes the point that in its heyday, Pets.com boasted a market capitalization of ~$400 million, which is dwarfed by Chewy’s more than $13 billion valuation, however these are useless metrics without context.', 'While Chewy’s current market cap is certainly more than 30 times that of Pets.com it also does 583 times more revenue, has positive gross margins, and boasts customer retention rates that outpace most software companies. While on a superficial level it is easy to draw parallels between the two highest profile online pet retailers, the reality is that Chewy is a fundamentally bigger, better and different business today than Pets.com ever was.', 'Chewy today is orders of magnitude larger than Pets.com, which allows it to leverage the high initial costs of shipping and fulfilling orders. Most people would find it futile to compare a company that did $6 million in revenue (like Pets.com) to one that eclipsed $3.5 billion last year. The importance of achieving scale in e-commerce cannot be overstated and is the first fundamental flaw in the comparison. Jeff Bezos explained this in Amazon’s 2000 letter to shareholders:', 'Online selling (relative to traditional retailing) is a scale business characterized by high fixed costs and relatively low variable costs. This makes it difficult to be a medium-sized e-commerce company. With a long enough financing runway, Pets.com and living.com may have been able to acquire enough customers to achieve the needed scale. But when the capital markets closed the door on financing Internet companies, these companies simply had no choice but to close their doors.', 'In order to make the necessary investments in its fixed costs – i.e. shipping and fulfillment infrastructure – an e-commerce company must grow fast enough that it can spread these high initial costs over a large enough revenue base. Unfortunately for Pets.com, the market wasn’t large enough to be viable at the time. In 2000 only 22% of Americans had ever made a purchase online and only 7% of Americans used the internet as a part of their routine product searches. The idea of buying anything online, let alone pet food, was a foreign concept to most consumers. This led to inefficient customer acquisition spending like $20 million on Super Bowl ads and a talking sock puppet, which never was able to move the needle fast enough for Pets.com to scale.', 'Internet companies today are doing billions in sales compared to millions of page visits 20 years ago. The rise of performance and direct marketing has reduced the friction in customer acquisition and allowed companies like Chewy to acquire customers more precisely and more cheaply than ever before.', 'The former Pets.com CEO, Julie Wainwright, explained the difference between then and now concisely in 2011:', 'Here is what the world looked like in 2000....there were no plug and play solutions for ecommerce/warehouse management and customer service that could scale...which means that we had to employ 40+ engineers. Cloud computing did not exist, which means that we had to have a server farm and several IT people to insure that the site did not go down. There were less than 250 Million worldwide Internet consumers in 2000- now there are 5 Billion. Amazon has reported a loss of nearly $900M in 1999...because guess what, ecommerce is a business of scale.', 'Since 2014, Chewy has grown from $200 million in sales to over $3.5 billion last year, now has over 11 million customers and purchases by existing customers represent 90% of revenue. The company has 7 distribution centers nationwide and can ship to 80% of the U.S. population overnight and almost 100% in two days. There’s no question that the fundamental barriers to scale exhibited in 2000 do not exist today, and that Chewy has been able to leverage its scale successfully over its history.', 'While Mr. Einhorn is correct in saying that Chewy has not been net profitable under GAAP standards, this obscures the core profitability of Chewy’s business. Between 2014 and 2018, the company burned only $134 million in free cash flow while growing revenue from $200 million to over $3.5 billion and spending approximately $750 million on marketing. Since inception, Chewy has had a positive gross margin and in the last three years the margin has expanded from 16.7% to over 20% in 2018.', 'While Mr. Einhorn may view marketing spending as throwing good money after bad, that is a misunderstanding of the lifetime value of a Chewy customer. By spending to acquire new customers, the company is deliberately depressing profitability of the existing customer base.', 'Given the underlying profitability and stickiness of existing customers, there was never a doubt that the marketing spend was yielding incremental returns above our hurdle rate. While the governor of growth has always been free cash flow, the lifetime value of customer acquisition was still above short-term profitability. Chewy could have been profitable years ago had we cut off the marketing spending, but it was a strategic decision to acquire and retain customers in order to maximize the long-term value of the business.', 'In Mr. Einhorn’s letter to his investors, he paraphrased Benjamin Graham in saying “Over the short-term the market is a voting machine and over the long-term it is a weighing machine.” I fundamentally agree with this quote, but not for the reasons it appears that Mr. Einhorn does. Just as the daily stock price is no indication of the quality of a business, the quarterly profitability of a company like Chewy has no bearing on the terminal value. We consistently chose to defer profitability in the short term in order to maximize shareholder value over the long term.', 'Value investing and entrepreneurialism are very much the same in the sense that they require contrarian decisions without immediate payback and run the risk of being misunderstood by the market for long periods of time. We’ve seen this playbook pay off for companies like Amazon and Netflix, but their success doesn’t make it any less nerve racking – especially when you have thousands of employees that depend on you for their job. Without conviction in the underlying economics of the business, I would have found it very hard to sleep at night if I thought our strategy wasn’t in the best interest of those employees, our millions of customers, or Chewy’s shareholders.', 'From day one, we chose to be a customer-obsessed business and replicate the experience of shopping in the neighborhood pet store. That meant focusing on bringing a human element to e-commerce and doing it at scale. Small touches like handwritten holiday cards and personalized pet portraits were ways we felt we could connect with customers and build loyalty over time.', 'While lots of companies talk about their flywheel, I truly believe that Chewy’s relationship with customers is the secret sauce. This is no more evident than in the fact that Chewy customers spend more with the company as time goes on – implying not only a level of trust but service and reliability. The net sales per active customer increased from $223 per year in 2012 to more than $334 in 2018.', 'All this to say that comparing Chewy to Pets.com is not only fundamentally incorrect but requires a deliberate misunderstanding of the evolution of e-commerce since the days of 1999-2001, as well as the importance of investing in the long-term viability of the business. While a quick glance may tell you that this business is no different than any other online pet retailer, ask any of Chewy’s customers and you’ll get a very different answer.', 'Even though I left Chewy last year, I’m extremely proud of the company and team we built. I urge investors to dig deeper into understanding the Chewy business and next time, let’s compare apples to apples. Times have changed.', 'Ryan Cohen is the founder and former CEO of e-commerce company Chewy, which went public in June.']"

But its lumber and indoor garden departments fell short compared with a year ago. Facing comparison to same-store sales growth of more than 50%, lumber fell negative this quarter. Indoor garden same-store sales were roughly flat.', 'A strong housing market has helped Home Depot and rival Lowe’s. Consumers have been investing more as home prices climb, increasing nearly 20% compared with a year ago. Demand for materials has been rising from home professionals, helping to offset lower demand from do-it-yourself projects. Home Depot holds a larger share of the professional market, although Lowe’s is trying to win more of that business.', 'Home Depot executives told analysts that professionals are still working through backlogs of projects as consumers feel comfortable having electricians, plumbers and contractors in their homes again. The retailer also recently relaunched its loyalty program for professionals, drawing more traffic to its mobile app in the hopes of convincing them to shop at Home Depot for all of their jobs.', 'This quarter, Home Depot’s customer transactions fell by 5.5% to 428.2 million. But consumers were spending more when they did visit, raising the average ticket by 12.9% to $82.38.

The plans, which are filed as an “R&D” facility, show a center for hardware operations and a separate new tech campus that would be accessible to the public, sitting between its current headquarters in Mountain View and its recently approved mega mixed-use campus in San Jose.', 'Dubbed “Midpoint,” the future tech campus will include five office buildings connected via a pedestrian bridge over a road.

', 'Europe’s top antitrust watchdog, the European Commission, accused Amazon on Tuesday of violating competition law by using nonpublic data it gathers from third-party merchants to unfairly compete against the smaller sellers. It also opened a second investigation into Amazon’s business practices related to the Prime label and the “Buy Box,” which offers customers a one-click button to add a product to their shopping cart.', 'Amazon rejected the European Commission’s accusations and said it supports thousands of businesses in Europe. ', 'If the European Commission finds that Amazon violated antitrust rules, the probe could provide new material to strengthen similar cases against Amazon in the U.S.', 'Congress and the Federal Trade Commission are also investigating Amazon’s treatment of third-party sellers. It’s unclear what the scope of the FTC’s investigation is, but the agency has been interviewing third-party sellers as part of the probe, Bloomberg reported in September. After a 16-month probe, the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee said last month that Amazon has monopoly power over third-party sellers.', 'Both investigations are in different stages. After publishing a sweeping report on the competitive practices of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, U.S. lawmakers are expected to introduce legislation based on their policy recommendations.', 'The EU hasn’t filed legal charges against Amazon, so it could be years before it announces any penalties. It could also reach a settlement with Amazon or drop the case altogether.', 'Regulators in Europe and the U.S. have objected to Amazon’s dual role as a marketplace operator and seller, arguing that this may foster anti-competitive conduct. ', 'They have pointed out that Amazon’s role as a marketplace service provider gives it privileged access to nonpublic third-party seller data, such as order volume history, shipping data and sellers’ past performance, that isn’t available to merchants. ', 'EU officials and Democrats in the House antitrust subcommittee share the view that this data from third-party sellers is used to inform Amazon’s first-party business decisions, such as what products to introduce and where to set the price. ', 'The insight “allows Amazon to focus its offers in the best-selling products across product categories and to adjust its offers in view of non-public data of competing sellers,” the EU said in a statement on Tuesday.', 'Similarly, the antitrust subcommittee’s investigation included testimony from third-party sellers who said their businesses were damaged when Amazon launched competing products. For example, one retired third-party merchant was forced to exit his seller business after Amazon allegedly copied his products, “down to the color palette,” undercut him on price and “took over the Buy Box for his listings, ‘killing his sales,’” the antitrust subcommittee said, citing an interview with the seller.', 'Amazon has long maintained that it doesn’t look at individual sellers’ data to build private-label products because doing so would violate internal policies. The company has acknowledged, however, that it may refer to aggregate data in the process of building its own products. ', 'Amazon has also rebutted regulators’ claims that it exploits its control over the Buy Box to give preferential treatment to its own products and those featured by sellers who use its logistics and delivery service, called Fulfillment By Amazon. The Buy Box refers to a section off to the side of a product page where sellers compete for their offers to be featured. ', 'Amazon has maintained that the Buy Box shows the offer it thinks customers will prefer, while factoring in things like price and delivery speed. At a July hearing in Congress, CEO Jeff Bezos acknowledged the Buy Box algorithm “indirectly” favors offers that can be shipped with Prime when determining which sellers are featured.', 'The House antitrust subcommittee probe and the EU investigation raised questions about third-party sellers’ ability to reach Prime users.', 'In the October report, U.S. lawmakers said they spoke to third-party sellers who feel they have “no choice” but to pay for Fulfillment by Amazon, which makes their products Prime eligible, in order to “maintain a favorable search result position, to reach Amazon’s more than 112 million Prime members, and to win the Buy Box.” ', 'Winning the Buy Box is crucial for third-party sellers products to be successful. The antitrust subcommittee estimated that roughly 80% of Amazon sales go through the Buy Box and “the percentage is even higher for mobile purchases.”', 'Prime members are also an important source of revenue for third-party sellers because they tend to generate more sales on Amazon’s marketplace than non-Prime users, the European Commission said. Prime members don’t just spend more money per purchase, but they also tend to shop on the site more frequently. ', 'With the EU and the U.S. questioning Amazon’s market power over sellers, it’s now up to Amazon to provide proof that it treats merchants fairly.', 'The company flatly disputed the House antitrust subcommittee’s findings, calling them “fringe notions.” Amazon can reply to the commission’s conclusions in writing or via an oral hearing.', '“The ball is in Amazon’s court to disprove these allegations,” said Shaoul Sussman, a legal fellow with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit.', 'The EU and U.S. identified similar issues with Amazon’s treatment of sellers, but the potential penalties and remedies they could settle on are likely to be different.', 'Democratic staffers in the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust recommended a wide range of remedies, including forcing companies to prove mergers would not harm competition and splitting different business units. For Amazon, this could result in it spinning off the third-party marketplace from its core retail operations.', 'As for the FTC probe, Amazon could be hit with fines or the company could reach a settlement with the agency in which it agrees to certain business restrictions.', 'Similarly, the EU has a range of penalties it could propose, including a fine of up to 10% of Amazon’s annual global revenue, or up to $28 billion based on 2019 figures.', 'The EU could also propose behavioral remedies, which attempt to preserve competition by requiring the companies to refrain from certain business conduct. But behavioral remedies can be “hit or miss” in terms of effectiveness, since some companies may find it “more profitable to violate the remedy and just pay the fines if they’re found in violation again,” Sussman said.', 'The most aggressive tool in the EU’s arsenal would be to recommend a line of business separation, Sussman said. For Amazon, this might mean that the EU orders it to stop selling its private-label brands in Europe.', '“That type of decision won’t affect the U.S. or any other market where Amazon sells those goods, but they could say, if you’re transacting in Europe, you’re not allowed to be a brand owner or manufacturer and operator of the platform,” Sussman said.', 'Sussman and other antitrust experts said they remain skeptical of whether the U.S. will be successful in bringing a case against Amazon and even if antitrust officials do, the remedies are likely to be limited. By contrast, European regulators have stepped up their efforts to crack down on Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google and Apple in recent years, earning them the reputation of being more aggressive.', 'The U.S. and Europe have different approaches when evaluating whether a company is engaging in anti-competitive conduct.', 'U.S. antitrust law is centered on the consumer welfare standard, which relies heavily on increased prices as an indication of harm. That standard has been hard to apply to tech companies because many of the products and services offered are free, or low cost, in the case of Amazon.', 'In the U.S., a company like Amazon can argue that whatever harm it’s causing competitors is offset by any benefits to consumers, i.e. lower prices and greater selection, Sussman said.', 'That argument is harder to prove to European antitrust enforcers.

45,"The used car boom is one of the hottest, and trickiest, coronavirus markets for consumers",2020-10-15T16:37:05+0000,"['For at least a few weeks during the worst of the Covid-19 shutdowns, ACV Auctions faced a challenge no start-up can be sure it can overcome: all of its core customers no longer allowed to be open for business. As car dealerships across the U.S. were put under lockdowns, the Buffalo, New York-based used car market technology company, which works with franchise and independent car dealers, was in a situation its CEO George Chamoun now recalls as “a bit scary.”', 'But like many pandemic surprise success stories, that period of uncertainty and existential crisis gave way to a boom in the buying and selling of used autos. By April and May, with a lack of new cars from auto plants able to hit dealer lots, and consumers more cautious about spending on big items, used car sales boomed. That has continued through the summer and fall: the past two months, August and September, posted the fastest rate of used car inventory turnover in the past six years, according to Edmunds.com data.', '“It wasn’t just a return back to pre-Covid,” Chamoun said at the CNBC Evolve virtual event on Thursday focused on middle market companies. “We’re selling higher units today than we were pre-Covid.”', 'In June, consulting firm AlixPartners estimated that due to the lockdowns, timeline to full auto factory restarts and a global consumer confidence decline, it expected a drop of 36 million new vehicle sales globally through 2022, compared to 2019 levels. In the U.S. market, it forecast a sales market for new cars lower by roughly 3.5 million vehicles year over year, with that outlook dependent on the recession not becoming prolonged. Automakers including GM have become more optimistic in commentary since the Q2 Covid-19 nadir, but even before Covid-19, the used car market was more than twice the size of the new car sales market.', 'Autonation and CarMax have been expanding their used car efforts, and their stocks have rebounded strongly from the Covid-19 stock market bottom in March. Carvana, which unlike ACV Auctions goes direct to consumers in selling used cars without dealers in the middle, has seen its stock increase from a $30 low point in March to over $200 today. Another online rival, Shift, is planning to soon go public soon through a special purpose acquisition company, which has become a prevalent way for private companies to IPO since the market began its recovery. Cars.com reported earnings on Thursday that sent its shares up 25%.', 'Overseas trends are similar, with private U.K.-based online car sales company Cazoo recently doubling its valuation.', 'The used car market in the U.S. is already estimated at 41 million units annually, and Chamoun says some of the changes triggered by the pandemic will continue to accelerate. The strength of consumers in the used car market shows that Americans continue to want to own vehicles, he says, whether to take kids to soccer or go to work. “Vehicles are the second highest-priced asset we as consumers purchase, so it’s really important and going to be important for the economy.”', 'ACV Auctions has 700 inspector teams and 100 regional managers working with car dealers across the U.S. to buy and sell used car inventory, and the company was forced to hire quickly as physical auctions became impossible for dealers during Covid-19 shutdowns.', 'Digital acceleration goals in the business world being compressed from years to months has been a major theme of the coronavirus economy across sectors, and in the auto sales market, more dealers are accepting the move to digital, Chamoun said, which is a major behavioral shift for the market.', 'Dealers have been going to physical auction locations for a long time, and business changes don’t take place all at once, Chamoun says, but when dealers suddenly could not go to a physical auction it shifted the behavior of dealers and has made more of the market willing to sell digitally, and bid on and buy vehicles online. “Both supply and demand are seeing an acceleration of dealers moving to digital,” Chamoun said. “We will see a more significant shift to digital over the next few years. It doesn’t mean cars won’t be in a physical location on a lot, but dealers will want to buy online and bid online,” he said.', 'The start-up, which became Buffalo’s first “unicorn” — a start-up valued at over $1 billion — in late 2019, has had to invent new technology tools to aid this shift in the used car market.', 'It built a tool to scan a car title and create electronic recognition of the documents so the title process could occur between buyers and sellers and ACV in a digital environment.', 'It also invented a way to scan the undercarriage of vehicle, called virtual lift, to take thousands of pictures of the undercarriage of cars as part of making the used car inspection process more transparent in a virtual environment.', 'And its AMP tool, for audio motor profile, can be attached to the engine of a used car and let both ACV and a dealer listen to the engine to make sure there are no potential issues.', 'During the first few weeks of the coronavirus shutdowns, Chamoun says his job was just trying to keep everyone calm since no one knew what would happen next with dealers or consumer sentiment. But that has changed. “What we really saw was strength.”', 'Online selling of cars is not entirely new. Speciality cars have been sold on platforms like eBay for years and dealerships have had the ability to sell cars online in a contactless experience, pre-Covid-19. But the pandemic has been a “next level” event, according to Edmunds.com senior manager of insights Ivan Drury. Some consumers will continue to want to interact in person and test drive up to as many as 10 cars, but the Carvana and CarMax models are taking the eBay specialty used car experience and making it more widespread for commuter cars.', '“These are Point A to Point B vehicles,” Drury said. “It’s a lasting trend. Will we see online sales grow at the level of Q2 2020? No. But at the same time it accelerated every dealership’s effort to really bolster up that part of the business.”', 'More consumers are interested in used cars in a weaker economy, and the new online models offer something that local dealers often can’t: a variety of models and custom features that can be shipped across states. “When it comes to availability and inventory and shipping across states, it’s been made so much easier,” Drury said. “There was such a drought in used vehicle inventory, even if I wanted to buy from a local dealer.”', 'The online experience also removes the “high-pressure situations” at dealers which many consumers prefer to avoid. “You control the flow online,” Drury said. That control advantage includes being able to break apart portions of the car buying and selling process, like trading in a current vehicle and adding it to the used car market. “You can do it online now and don’t have to trade in to a dealership. ... You can can see what the dealer will offer versus online, so there’s more control over each component,” he said.', 'But the auto consumer expert stressed that online businesses like Carvana and Shift Technologies remain small relative to the total size of the used auto market. Carvana sold a few hundred thousands units in all of 2019, and a little over 55,000 in the second quarter of 2020. That is in a used car market that is above 40 million units annually.', '“They are gaining traction and there is lots of market for them to transact on, but not everyone is doing it,” Drury said. He estimated Carvana and Shift combined sales at less than 1% of the market.', 'He also cautioned consumers about assuming that online companies are always the most competitive on price. The online competition is a good thing for consumer pricing options in general, but in some cases online sellers charge a premium for their service and inventory and shipping across states. That means consumers should always check to make sure the same vehicles are not available at a lower cost in a contactless online experience from a local dealership.', 'One reason prices rise is a limit on inventory, and there is a sector check on how much the used car market can grow even amid high demand. With 45% of new car sales relying on a trade-in as part of the financial equation, the used car market is linked to the overall sales environment for restocking of its inventory. At a time when consumers are buying less cars overall, the vehicles coming into the used inventory from rental agencies and dealer lease-ends are not enough to tilt the supply-demand balance.', '“Casting a wider net can help you get a better price,” said Brian Moody, executive editor at Autotrader.', 'He said the big issue right now in the used car market is the high demand. Prices have recently been rising on used cars, not going down over time, and that is something you rarely see in the market. Pricing has softened a little since the summer, but Moody said shoppers “shouldn’t go looking for deals.” Rather, they should be more focused on getting what they want. “I would shop around. ... but don’t be surprised if you end up having to pay more than expected for a specific car you want,” he said.', 'Many local dealers offering online sales do have virtual walkaround technology, test drives available at home, as well as delivery. They also have the advantage of offering access to a service department. “The local dealer is not completely out of the game,” he said.', 'Especially for consumers interested in recent models, between one and four years old, inventory will be stronger at dealers and they can offer you certified pre-owned vehicles, in some cases, at low APR financing as well.', '“People do want to buy cheaper cars but so many people are going for a lower price range there are fewer units out there and you have to get into older and older models to get cheap used cars,” Drury said. “Don’t discount the local dealer,” he added.  ', 'Even the auto experts are finding the current used car market a tough one to navigate in their personal consumer lives.', 'Drury was recently in the market for a used vehicle but ended up buying new because he said the prices were high on used cars he was interested in, and the incentives offered with the new vehicles were good. As the end of the calendar year nears, and 2021 models start showing up, prices on 2020 models may become even more attractive.', 'Buying a new car is always going to mean spending more, sacrificing as much as $12,000 to $15,000 in savings available on some used car models, but if a consumer’s budget is flexible, buying a new car can be the right decision. “I spent $10,000 more than I wanted to, but with the warranty and other benefits and new technology, it made more sense,” the Edmunds.com expert said. “There used to be a straightforward answer, but not right now.”   ', 'Autotrader’s Moody said his current car lease isn’t up for another year, and that’s a good thing in the current used car market. “I am relieved, relieved by the fact that I don’t have to make a decision in this tumultuous environment. People are paying more for used cars.”']"

And they also question whether it’s  being driven by commercial interests, or Chinese geopolitics.', 'About a year from the scheduled completion of a $5.2  billion Panama Canal extension that will let  the existing waterway accommodate bigger ships, a Chinese  consortium and the Managua government have said that they began  work on a Nicaragua canal. ', 'Read More', '  Hong Kong Nicaragua Canal Development Investment (HKND) claims  that it will complete the megaproject in 2019. (A project  “groundbreaking” cited by media reports in December was actually  just the start of an access road to let through heavy  equipment.)', '  The Nicaragua Grand Canal is projected to cost $50 billion, and  HKND says it will be able to accommodate ships of up to 23,000  twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs, a measure equal to 20 feet by 8 feet by 8 feet of  cargo). That compares with the 13,000 TEUs that the Panama  Canal will be able to accommodate after its expansion. ', '  But the 173-mile Nicaragua canal project has generated criticism  and skepticism, and lots of it. Industry experts question the  level of demand for a second canal, its potential as a going  business concern and the possible environmental impact in what  is geologically unstable terrain. Many even doubt that the  project will go much further than its paper proposal. ', '  “The vision is very significant, but the reality is, a lot of  people, including myself, are very skeptical that this will  happen,” said Eric Farnsworth, vice president at  the Americas Society and Council of the Americas, a  group that promotes democracy and free trade. “There have been  over 70 attempts to build a canal in Nicaragua, but it hasn’t  happened.” ', ' Read MoreDoubts deepen over Chinese-backed  Nicaragua canal', '  Farnsworth cited Nicaragua’s geological instability, including  active volcanos and earthquakes, as one reason the Nicaraguan  canal was never built in the first place. In 1902, Panama beat out Nicaragua for the  American-built canal route, when the U.S. Senate voted for the  smaller, more southerly nation by a mere eight votes. The canal  played an important role in the recent U.S. West Coast ports strike, which forced some  vessels to use the Panama route to get their goods to the East  Coast.', '  Meanwhile, Nicaraguan farmers opposing the canal construction  have organized protests—some of which have become  violent—because it would expropriate their lands. Activists  have also voiced loud concerns over the canal’s environmental  impact, pointing out that it would require the dredging of Lake  Nicaragua, the largest freshwater lake in Central America and a critical water  source. ', '  Like Farnsworth, a large number of experts who spoke to CNBC  have more questions than answers about the project, but they all  agree on one thing: There’s not enough demand to justify a second  canal so close to the Panama Canal.', '  “I sincerely believe we don’t need another canal. I don’t think  there’s enough ship traffic to warrant the construction of  another canal,” said Bruce Carlton, president and CEO of the  National Industrial Transportation League, a shipping industry  advocacy group.', '  Nicaragua refutes that argument. Telémaco Talavera,  official spokesperson for the Nicaragua Grand Canal project, said  that there will be demand from world shippers for their very  largest vessels, which even the improved Panama Canal won’t be  able to accommodate.', ' Read MoreCrime on the high seas: The world’s  most pirated waters', '  “The Triple-E type of ships won’t be able to go through the  Panama Canal, but Nicaragua will permit the passage of these  ships,” Talavera told CNBC, in an interview which like several  for this story is translated from Spanish. “There will be a need  for world shippers to reduce time, costs and pollution, and that  will be an opportunity for Nicaragua and the rest of the region.”', 'The Triple-E that Talavera refers to is a  1,312-foot ship, the largest ship by length that is operated by  Maersk, the world’s largest container-shipping company by  capacity. But even Maersk cast doubt on the need for a Nicaragua  canal.', '  “It’s not something we have a demand for, and we’re not able, at  this point, to tell whether we will use it,” said Michael  Storgaard, senior press officer at Maersk. “It may be so heavily  priced that we may not use it. We don’t know anything right now.”', '  Moreover, most ports in the United States won’t be able to  accommodate the larger ships that the Nicaragua canal is hoping  to target, said Jean-Paul Rodrigue, a transportation expert at Hofstra University. He added that it would require a hugely  expensive investment for U.S. ports to gear up for those types of  ships.', '  “The shipping industry is bleeding,” Rodrigue said. “The current  volume is not conducive for this type of investment.”  The shipping industry took a hit during the financial crisis when  many economies’ growth stalled and trade volume decline.', '  Hong Kong-based HKND, which won the canal project on a  no-bid basis and was granted a 50-year, renewable concession to  run it, is betting on an industry comeback: “China  should be expected to again accelerate its own economic growth in  the coming decades, while many other countries will re-establish  more respectable growth rates than those experienced in recent  years,” the group says on its website.', '  But even a comeback in demand on a global basis doesn’t warrant  another canal in Central America, critics say. Any given waterway’s future traffic volume is a bet that depends on economic trends on literally a global scale.', '  “General demand may grow at a moderate rate, but not necessarily  in the canal route, and not necessarily in the product category  that would make the route profitable in terms of tolls,” said  Rodolfo Sabonge, a former marketing and development executive of  the Panama Canal Authority, who was in charge of analyzing demand  projections for the expansion project. ', 'Read More', '  Sabonge pointed out, for example, that Brazil has seen huge  economic growth in Latin America, but anything that ships to or from a point south of Recife, depends on the Cape of Good Hope as its route to or from the Pacific. ', '  The Panama Canal expansion began in 2007, adding a third set of  locks and doubling its waterway capacity. The current locks allow  the passage of up to 5,000 TEUs, but after the expansion is  completed, the canal will be able to handle the passage of ships  with up to 13,000 TEUs.', '  “We didn’t decide the size of the new locks arbitrarily. We  decided them based on a study of demand, and we chose the lock  size that made sense for the next 15 years,” he said of the  Panama’s Canal’s expansion. ', '  Nicaragua’s motivation for the canal is obvious. The Central  American country is the second-poorest country in the Americas,  after Haiti, with 42.5 percent of its population living in  poverty (2009). The project would generate 50,000 jobs during its  construction phase, and another 200,000 jobs once it is  in operation. Panama, a prosperous economy, with an economic  growth rate of 8.4 percent, is in many ways a reflection of what  Nicaragua could have been.

It will be a development process that will help us  get rid of our main enemy—poverty,” said Francisco  López, vice chancellor at the Universidad Central de  Nicaragua. ', '  The development plans include the building of roads, two  ports—one in the Pacific and another one in the  Caribbean—an airport, a free trade zone and a tourism complex  with hotels. HKND has approval to build some of the  other elements even if it doesn’t build the canal  itself. ', '  The motivation for HKND is less clear, and the company did not  respond to CNBC’s repeated requests for comment.', '  Given the project’s expected costs of operation, the tolls  in the much larger Nicaragua Grand Canal would have to be considerably higher  than the tolls in the Panama Canal in order for  investors to benefit from the project.', ' Read MorePort slowdown costing small businesses  time and trust', '  The canal would need to generate an annual income of about $5  billion, explained Sabonge. But the  Panama Canal, with a transit of 13,482 ships, carrying 327  million tons, generates annual revenue of only about $2 billion,  according to 2014 figures. ', '  Naturally, the lack of an apparent financial feasibility has  raised questions about whether the Nicaragua Grand Canal is a commercial project for HKND—or a geopolitical project for  the Chinese government.', '  “If an investor doesn’t see that there’s a viable option, or  demand out there to make a profit, they wouldn’t make an  investment. That leaves the question of maybe it’s coming from  the government,” said Chang Qian Guan, a professor at the U.S.  Merchant Marine Academy. ', '  HKND and the Nicaragua government have both denied that the  Chinese government is involved. It’s worth noting as well that  Nicaragua and China don’t have formal diplomatic relations.  China, however, has expressed interest in the past in building a  railway across South America as an alternative to the Panama  Canal. Most Chinese imports to and from the region travel through Panama. ', '  Controlling that passage would be a boost to China’s commercial  security, something that Beijing has already  demonstrated—through its actions in the South China Sea, East China Sea, Africa and  elsewhere—is a political priority of the first order.', '  If Beijing is the project’s real sponsor, then its essentially  limitless pockets would mean big problems for Panama.', '  “If there are geopolitical interests behind the building of the  canal, and the investment returns do not matter, and nothing has  to be repaid, then the Panama Canal would be severely affected.  There is not enough demand for two canals,” Sabonge said. ', '  “But if the Nicaragua canal has to adhere to what any other  business has to, from an investment standpoint, I think the canal  wouldn’t be much of an impact for the Panama Canal,” he  said. “Based on investment requirements, the prices of the  Nicaragua canal would be very high, and the Panama Canal would be  able to maintain its profits and lower prices.” ']"

Apple instead released new Apple Watches last month and pushed the iPhone announcement to October. The delay is an outgrowth of the Covid-19 pandemic, which disrupted electronics manufacturing and forced most Apple employees to work from home. ', 'Still, this year’s iPhone launch is significant. It is expected to include the first major exterior redesign since 2017, when Apple released the iPhone X with facial recognition. This year’s models will feature iPad-like edges with flatter sides, compared with the gently curving sides of the current iPhones. ', 'Apple is also expected to release four separate iPhones at different screen sizes and prices -- a much wider range of devices than in the past.', 'Finally, at least some new iPhones will support 5G cellular networks, which promise faster download times (although the networks aren’t fully built out yet in the U.S., which could disappoint some users.)', 'The last time Apple made such big changes to the iPhone was 2014, when the iPhone 6 came out with bigger screens and two different sizes. That prompted a major upgrade cycle -- a so-called “super-cycle” -- with over 231 million iPhones sold in the next four quarters. That remained the annual unit sales record until Apple stopped reporting unit sales in 2018. ', 'So this year’s changes have investors and analysts predicting a big upgrade cycle that will make Apple an even more valuable company.', '“We expect this fall’s launch to be the most significant iPhone event in years,” Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty wrote in a note this week. She’s forecasting Apple to ship about 220 million iPhones in its fiscal 2021, which would be up 22% year-over-year according to the Morgan Stanley model.', 'Here’s what to look for on Tuesday.', 'Morgan Stanley analysts are expecting an iPhone lineup of 4 new devices, including:', 'Morgan Stanley’s expectations are based on information from Apple’s supply chain of manufacturers in China. That means the actual names, which are controlled by Apple product marketing in California, may end up being different.', 'Four models would be a dramatic expansion of its lineup, with both a new smaller option and a larger high-end option, giving consumers more choices and potentially spurring people to upgrade.', 'The phones are expected to be visually different from past years’ models, giving users another reason to upgrade.', 'In the spring, Apple released a $399 4.7-inch iPhone with a fingerprint sensor, the second-generation iPhone SE, this spring, which is expected to remain the least expensive iPhone after Tuesday’s launch. ', '“These 4 new models will accompany the 2nd generation iPhone SE launched in spring 2020 to comprise Apple’s most complete lineup of new iPhones ever,” Huberty wrote.

Apple may continue selling these models -- typically, it knocks $100 off the price of last year’s models and keeps them on store shelves.', 'Apple’s tagline for the event is “Hi Speed,” a reference to the faster cellular speeds promised by 5G phones.', 'Investors and analysts have hoped for years that a 5G iPhone would represent a major upgrade and spur a big wave of sales not only for phone makers like Apple, but also for chip-makers like Qualcomm and carriers like Verizon and T-Mobile, which have bet big on 5G.', 'But some industry leaders are cautious. For instance, AT&T Communications CEO Jeff McElfresh told CNBC in September that he did not believe it would be a “massive event.”', 'Some of the impact may be blunted because there are three different varieties of 5G.', 'The biggest jump in speeds will come from the variety of 5G sometimes called millimeter wave or ultrawide band.

While carriers are expanding quickly, the new iPhones may only be able to reach their full potential in a handful of regions.

That may underwhelm consumers who have been looking for a massive improvement.

T-Mobile said this summer that it hoped to build its mid band network “over the next few years.”', '“Not all 5G is created equal, which has led to marketing noise from carriers regarding 5G performance and deployment,” Loup Ventures founder Gene Munster wrote in a newsletter in September. “In the end, both consumers and businesses are left unsure as to the timing of the 5G transformation.”', 'Consumers won’t know until Tuesday if Apple will support all three versions in all its phones, or if it will offer different models sold in different regions based on which countries have the most developed 5G networks. ', 'Apple CFO Luca Maestri said this summer that it expected iPhones to go on sale a “few weeks later” than the traditional September launch schedule.', 'It’s possible that some models will go on sale shortly after the event while others take a longer time to hit store shelves, most likely due to challenges designing and manufacturing ten of millions of devices during a global pandemic. Last year, ten days elapsed between the launch event and the first iPhones that went on sale.', '“It remains somewhat speculative when exactly iPhones will be available for sale after this event as Apple typically announces the first day of sale during the event,” Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong wrote in a note this past week.', 'Timing matters for investors because Apple’s first fiscal quarter has already started, kicking off on September 27. In past years, some new iPhone models have been on sale for the entire period, but this year that won’t be possible.

In the past, the company has loved to tease “one more thing” at the end of its events before it introduces a whole new product category.', 'This year, it’s likely to be audio products. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted earlier this year that Apple is working on wireless over-the ear headphones that would carry its own brand (instead of Beats), and a smaller and less expensive HomePod speaker -- the current version costs $299.', 'Luxury headphones could entice buyers who have been turned off by the in-ear nature of Apple’s current AirPods but want closer wireless integration with the iPhone.

The primary goal of the mission is to deploy two satellites in orbit for BlackSky.', 'Beck’s company wants to recover the boosters so it can launch more often, while also reducing the cost of each mission. ', 'But Rocket Lab’s approach to recovering its boosters is different from SpaceX, which uses the rocket’s engines to slow down during reentry and deploys wide legs to land on large pads.', 'Rocket Lab, instead, is testing a technology Beck calls an “aero thermal decelerator”—using the atmosphere to slow down the rocket. After reaching space, Rocket Lab’s onboard computer guides the booster through reentry—where it travels at up to eight times the speed of sound and is subject to heat in excess of 4,350 degrees Fahrenheit.', 'Then a parachute deploys from the top of the booster to slow it down and, like its first recovery in November, splash down in the Pacific Ocean. ', 'The splashdown is expected to occur about 400 miles from the launch site, where a Rocket Lab ship will then scoop it out of the water. Beck said this is the second of three planned splashdown recoveries, before the company moves to its full reuse plan: Plucking the booster with its parachute from the sky with a helicopter.', 'Rocket Lab is in the process of combining with Vector Acquisition, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), in a deal which values the space company at $4.1 billion. The merger is expected to close in the second quarter, when Rocket Lab will list on the Nasdaq and the SPAC’s shares, which currently trade under the ticker VACQ, will convert to RKLB as the combined company.', 'A SPAC is a shell company that’s set up to raise money via an initial public offering in order to merge with an existing private company and take it public.', 'Beck said the Electron booster for this next mission will feature a “beefed up heat shield,” as the heat shield on the prior recovery mission “took a real beating” during the intense reentry. ', 'Overall, the rocket booster “was in remarkable shape,” and the company now “understands the load” on the heat shield better, he added.', 'Beck said there will be one more major upgrade before the third splashdown recovery mission. ', 'The external changes are minimal, he noted, with most of the updates affecting “subtleties around control and managing the thermal load” on the booster.', 'Rocket Lab’s goal is to “do the minimum amount of refurbishment possible” with the boosters it recovers, so it can turn them around quickly between launches. The company is reusing parts from the first Electron booster it recovered, which is now “severely disassembled,” Beck said. ', 'While the booster took “a quick dunk in the saltwater for a few hours,” he said Rocket Lab has yet to find any lasting problems with parts that it plans to requalify and launch on other rockets.', 'Once the company completes all three splashdown tests this year, it will move to the mid-air recovery attempts. ', 'Rocket Lab demonstrated that it can catch a booster with a helicopter in a test last year, which Beck noted they did on the first try.', 'Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket has carried more than 100 small satellites to orbit over the past couple of years. The company has also built a spacecraft manufacturing business.', 'Beck’s company has launch facilities in New Zealand and Virginia. Rocket Lab’s first launch from the U.S. has been delayed by regulatory reviews and is not expected to be complete until later this year.', 'The additional launch facility will be key, as Rocket Lab last year said it had 26 missions booked for 2021. Having both facilities gives the company as many as 132 launch opportunities per year.', 'Last November, Beck said Rocket Lab was building Electron boosters in under 30 days, and told CNBC that the company is now down to 26 days—with its goal to get production to a rate of one rocket every 18 days.', 'Rocket Lab also unveiled plans for a second, larger rocket called Neutron to lift more payloads than its current Electron rocket. The launch marketplace is divided into three sections: small, medium and heavy lift. Neutron will target that medium section.', 'Neutron, which is expected to launch in 2024 for the first time, will stand at 131 feet tall and will be capable of carrying as much as 8,000 kilograms to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab did not disclose how much Neutron is expected to cost per launch.', 'The company expects Neutron to cost about $200 million to develop. Its first launch will come from NASA’s Wallops flight facility in Virginia. Rocket Lab plans to build a Neutron-specific factory in the region.', 'Neutron will also have a reusable booster, but the new rocket will “land on an ocean platform” using a propulsive landing. Electron “was always designed to be really, really manufacturable rather than really, really reusable,” Beck said.', 'Musk, shortly after Rocket Lab unveiled its plan for Neutron, commented that the rocket “looks familiar” but is “nonetheless, the right move.” SpaceX conducted multiple short flight tests of prototypes as it perfected landing its Falcon 9 rocket booster, a route Beck isn’t sure Rocket Lab will take.', '“Whether or not we see the need for hop tests is really to be determined, but our kind of current baseline doesn’t have us doing that,” Beck said.']"

And during this pandemic, we’ve seen delays and backlogs of goods from automobiles to electronics, from shoes to furniture,” Biden said in his debut at the G-20 since becoming president.', '“Ending the pandemic is the ultimate key to unlocking the disruptions we’re all contending with. But, we have to take action now, together with our partners in the private sector, to reduce the backlogs that we’re facing,” he said. “Now that we have seen how vulnerable these lines of global commerce can be, we cannot go back to business as usual.”', 'Biden, alongside leaders from 14 other countries and the European Union, agreed to “foster greater international cooperation on near-term supply-chain disruptions,” according to a White House readout of the meeting. The leaders also plan to strengthen and diversify the entire supply-chain ecosystem from reliance on certain raw materials to manufacturing to shipping and distribution.', 'The world’s supply chain is continuing to bear the brunt of a relentless pandemic, surging consumer demand, labor shortages and overseas manufacturing delays, which has led to higher transportation costs and inflation.', 'In an effort to address the U.S.’s own supply-chain issues, Biden also announced the following domestic measures:', 'Earlier this month, the Biden administration unveiled a plan to run operations 24/7 at the California ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which account for 40% of sea freight entering the U.S.', 'Last week, the twin ports announced new fines on carriers at the nation’s busiest port complex in order to abate the intensifying logjam of cargo ships.', 'Once loaded off vessels, containers moved by trucks will have nine days before fines start accruing.

56,"Tesla employees say they took shortcuts, worked through harsh conditions to meet Model 3 production goals",2019-07-15T23:29:04+0000,"['Current and former Tesla employees working in the company’s open-air “tent” factory say they were pressured to take shortcuts to hit aggressive Model 3 production goals, including making fast fixes to plastic housings with electrical tape, working through harsh conditions and skipping previously required vehicle tests.', 'For instance, four people who worked on the assembly line say they were told by supervisors to use electrical tape to patch cracks on plastic brackets and housings, and provided photographs showing where tape was applied. They and four additional people familiar with conditions there describe working through high heat, cold temperatures at night and smoky air during last year’s wildfires in Northern California.', 'Their disclosures highlight the difficult balance Tesla must strike as it ramps up production while trying to stem costs.', 'Tesla recently told shareholders that in the three months that ended June 30, it made 87,048 vehicles, including 72,531 Model 3s, the company’s lowest-priced sedan. Both were quarterly records. Tesla told shareholders to expect full-year deliveries this year to reach at least 360,000, and more than 250,000 of those are expected to be Model 3s.', 'Last year, Tesla conquered some “production hell” issues, as CEO Elon Musk called them. That included removing or repurposing conveyors and robots that didn’t work as planned, and figuring out how to build cars and battery packs with more manual labor.', 'This year, Tesla has been grappling with what could be described as “logistics hell.” It has had to deliver cars to customers in more points around the world than ever before. Tesla executives have said the company should be profitable in the second half of 2019.', 'A Tesla spokesperson said the anecdotes employees shared about work in the tent are “misleading and do not reflect our manufacturing practices or what it’s like to work at Tesla.”', 'The spokesperson said many of the shortcuts described by employees, such as using electrical tape during assembly, are not approved procedures, and that cars are rigorously inspected before shipping. Tesla also said many of the parts used in the Model 3 come with electrical tape on them from suppliers, and showed CNBC photographs of some factory-taped parts.', 'The company said its first-pass yields at the Fremont, California, plant are higher than ever — a measurement that indicates Tesla is producing good cars and is scrapping or reworking fewer units than it did historically.', 'Regarding working conditions in the tent, Tesla said, “We work hard to create a work environment that is as safe, fair and fun as possible, and it is incredibly important to us that employees look forward to coming to work every day. In fact, we have a large number of employees who request to work on GA4 based on what they hear from colleagues and what they have seen first-hand.”', 'Tesla assembles some of its Model 3s in a tent, known as GA4 (“general assembly 4”) in Fremont. Built in spring 2018, it was supposed to be a temporary measure. The idea was to run the tent mostly on manual labor while Tesla perfected its automated factory lines indoors in what’s called “the brick.” The tent has now been operating for more than a year.', 'Workers told CNBC that GA4 is now able to produce up to 120 cars per shift, across three shifts per day, amounting to 2,160 Model 3s in a perfect six-day week, or around 30,000 per quarter assuming maximum rates of production.', 'Tesla did not confirm these numbers, but in a statement last year, the company said GA4 was responsible for about 20% of total Model 3 production during a high-output week in July 2018.', 'While the tented line does not crank out the majority of Tesla’s Model 3s, it still adds significant volume. When Model 3 lines inside the Fremont factory go down, workers in the tent can stay productive. That’s important to Tesla, given its history of over-automation and missed targets.', 'In the tent, Model 3s are put together using manual labor and power tools, lifts and conveyors, but not with any of the sophisticated robotics Tesla uses on the indoor assembly lines. Workers say they do one process at their station repeatedly, usually walking along the line with the car until they’re done.', 'Carlos Aranda was a former lead production associate who worked in GA4. Correspondence shared with CNBC shows he resigned from Tesla on June 24, following months of medical leave stemming from injuries he says he sustained on the job. (Tesla claims he was fired for a Twitter post that went against its Workplace Violence Policy, but provided no record of the offending tweet prior to publication, and the separation papers Aranda shared with CNBC do not mention a tweet. After publication, Tesla pointed to a tweet in which Aranda said, “I am so sick of tesla giving me the run around. I am about to quit and burn them to the ground. With what i know i can put a big monkey wrench in the works.”)', 'His wife, Maggie Aranda, worked as a Model 3 production associate in another part of GA4. She says she was dismissed on June 11 for using her phone during a shift to book health appointments after an injury. Both the Arandas previously worked on indoor assembly lines at the factory.', 'Six current and former employees supported their accounts of work in GA4 but asked to remain unidentified.', 'These people said that while work in GA4 is physically demanding, many people like working there because the atmosphere is good and camaraderie is strong. They said they can listen to music while they work, with a supervisor’s approval, and don’t always have to wear a uniform.', 'At the same time, workers were encouraged to take shortcuts to hit their production goals in the tent, according to five people who work or worked there recently.', 'For example, when it’s cold in the tent, workers tend to break a high number of plastic brackets and housings that hold critical electronics in place inside of the Model 3, according to four of these people.', 'Rather than waiting for replenishment teams to deliver boxes of new plastic parts to their stations in GA4, they said, supervisors told workers to use vinyl electrical tape to make quick fixes. Carlos Aranda says he personally visited Walmart multiple times to buy the tape and other items for production associates.', 'For instance, this photo shows tape applied to a segment of a white plastic housing where it holds “triple cam” connections in place inside of a Model 3. The Arandas said the edge of this plastic housing piece would frequently crack during installation, and tape was often applied here to hold down the resulting, hinge-like flap.', 'Installed in the windshield of a Model 3, a “triple cam” holds three cameras that allow the vehicle to see the road, traffic lights, lane markings and obstacles ahead. If triple cam connections loosen or break, some of Tesla’s safety features — like Sentry mode, AutoPilot, automatic emergency braking or full self-driving — may fail, the Arandas said. The car should then give drivers an alert that AutoPilot is no longer engaged, and the car needs service.', 'Tesla said many of the parts they use in the Model 3 come with electrical tape on them from suppliers, and showed CNBC photographs of some factory-taped parts.', 'Current and former GA4 workers acknowledged this, too. However, they made a distinction — the GA4 workers use tape to fix housings or brackets with cracks or to stop parts from vibrating in the car if they aren’t snapped or fastened in perfectly. That’s not the same as “factory tape,” they said.', 'Factory tape is high-quality and looks as if it’s shrink-wrapped on a part, always in the same place. Much of it is wound carefully around bundles of cables and wires in a perfect spiral. The tape that workers would apply in a Model 3 typically has hastily cut or torn ends and varies in placement.', 'A Tesla spokesperson says the company hasn’t found evidence of electrical tape being used to make quick fixes in GA4, and would never officially condone or encourage it. The company also emphasized that its cars go through rigorous quality inspections before they leave the factory.', 'A former Tesla technician, who worked in the tent on Model 3s and asked to remain unidentified, analyzed photos from GA4 that were shared with CNBC by current and former employees.', 'This person said Tesla’s vehicle engineers would probably not appreciate that Model 3s were being assembled with this cheap vinyl electrical tape, and any processes allowing prodigious use of the tape during assembly should be reevaluated.', 'The technician also emphasized that the Tesla Model 3 is an ideal electric vehicle — as long as it’s built exactly to spec.', 'Workers say they took other short cuts to hit aggressive new production targets, too.', 'Five people who work or worked in the tent in 2019 said they would frequently pass cars down the line that they knew were missing a few bolts, nuts or lugs, all in the name of saving time.', 'In the tent, most workers have just a couple of minutes to complete a process. If a small item was missing, or a bolt was not torqued in perfectly, they would rather keep cars moving than stop the line and be seen as a bottleneck to production, they said.', 'In particular, these people said, aeroshields are often missing a middle bolt, and loose connections in body controllers are a common issue.', 'For example, this photo shows the power supply for a distribution block in the front right vehicle controller in a Model 3. A nut is missing that should be there to secure electrical connections.', 'Wires in this part of the car go to the touchscreen, car computer, door latches and window regulators on the right hand side of the Model 3, while the red cable distributes power into the systems on the right hand side.', 'Although it’s a low-voltage connection, if it’s not properly secured, it can heat up and cause problems, the former Tesla technician said. Model 3s with loose connections can be hard to detect during inspections, the ex-technician and factory workers said.', 'Tesla said the company “has a robust quality assurance team that reviews each vehicle at the end of the GA4 assembly line to ensure every car was built correctly and is perfect before it leaves our factory to go to customers.”', 'Current and former employees also said Tesla reduced “water testing” on cars as the company began ramping up production of Model 3s.', 'In a water test, a vehicle goes into a booth where jets blast it with water from all different directions. Any leaks in the seals are immediately found and fixed. The tests take about 10 minutes each.', 'In late 2018, Tesla changed its policy and now only conducts sample testing for water leaks on Model 3s.', 'Since then, if workers see an issue with the urethane seals around a Model 3 glass roof, for example, they can request a water test. But many in GA4 are hesitant to make that request because of time pressure and a lack of experience or training that they need to identify flaws, a current associate said.', 'A Tesla spokesperson said the company is not aware of any instances where workers were told not to do water testing because that may slow production. The company says it encourages employees to identify opportunities for improvement, and engage all appropriate teams to evaluate potential risks and identify possible solutions.', 'In addition, six current and prior employees said, workers often violated a rule that cars should only be driven in “factory mode,” which now limits speed to 10 mph. Workers would sneak freshly built Model 3s out of factory mode to zip them over to a camera calibration station (or “cam cal”), which was located far away from the GA4 tent. (That station has since been moved closer to the tent.)', 'Employees caught doing this would be appropriately disciplined, Tesla said.', 'Mike Ramsey, senior automotive research director at Gartner, said that even before Tesla put a Model 3 assembly line in a tent, it had a “ship-it-now, fix-it-later” mentality inspired by software patching.', 'Tesla’s focus, instead, has been to exceed expectations in other areas like brand, vehicle acceleration or charging, he said. While Tesla has been successful with those efforts, he said: “Every time a car rolls off the lot and a piece of trim falls off, or an electrical system is failing after a month, it undermines the brand. That customer is not likely to buy another Tesla.”', 'Ramsey also said, “The idea that you would not stop the line, and would patch something with spit and bailing wire — OK, not literally that, but close to it — almost certainly injects quality issues down the road that they are going to have to fix.”', 'Exposure to the elements in GA4 poses another problem for the workers.', 'Six current and recent Tesla employees said GA4 workers have repeatedly asked Tesla’s environmental health and safety teams to help with cold temperatures overnight, sweltering heat during the days, and pests — including mice and bugs — in the tent.', 'They say workers commonly deal with heat rash and heat exhaustion.', 'Tesla installed big fans in GA4 to distribute heat and circulate air. However they are not on consistently, these people said, and usually don’t make a big difference.', 'Tesla said its environmental health and safety team monitors temperatures to ensure they are within a comfortable range for the safety of employees, production equipment and car parts. They also said they provide temperature controls like cool fans, hydration, rest breaks and heat stress awareness training to employees.', 'Hot, dry conditions can also lead to problems with air quality.', 'Correspondence reviewed by CNBC shows that Tesla required GA4 workers to report for duty even as wildfire smoke floated up from the massive Camp Fire that devastated Northern California in November. On Nov. 9, the day after the Camp Fire ignited, the AirNow Air Quality Index rated Fremont at an “unhealthy” 165, and continued in the unhealthy range for at least another week.', 'Tesla did not proactively distribute respirator masks to GA4 workers in the first few days after the Camp Fire began. Workers had to request the masks, according to internal correspondence shared with CNBC. Inside the building portion of the factory they had HVAC and good air flow, but tent workers were stuck, said Maggie Aranda, and they did not get time off due to the smoke.', 'Tesla says it offered air filter masks who those who wanted them and provided face masks every day as a precautionary measure.', 'When conditions turn cold and wet, other problems arise. For instance, this photo shows rain seeping into the tented roof at GA4.', 'Employees wear layers, and big coats that can impede their movement. Supervisors distribute disposable hand-warming packets that workers slip into their gloves or tape to their bodies. Tesla provided big red jackets for GA4 workers last year, but stopped distributing them by early 2019, according to several current and former employees.', 'On cold nights early this year, workers in a tented “paint hospital” sometimes used heat lamps, which are used to dry paint and clear coat on cars, to warm their own bodies, according to current and former production associates. This paint hospital has since been moved indoors, according to public records with the city of Fremont.', 'At a GA4 station where employees checked Model 3 vehicle alignment, Carlos Aranda said, workers used space heaters in late 2018. But when it rained, water seeping into the tent from above and below made these a hazard, he said.', 'He shared photos of a leaking roof and space heater there, plugged in, with rain puddling nearby. Tesla says using space heaters is against company policy.', 'Pests are another problem. In the second quarter of 2019, Tesla employees said, mice chewed through wires and caused a conveyor breakdown in early May, delaying Model 3 production on at least one shift. Tesla said it has no record of this occurring.', 'A former physician’s assistant who worked at Tesla’s on-site clinic, Anna Watson, said: “It was general knowledge that the GA4 tent and North Paint were the most challenging places to work at Tesla,” during her brief tenure there in 2018. Another former Tesla HR employee confirmed this, and said the tent was seen as a place for tougher workers, or young blood.', 'Tesla offered the following statement in response to this story:', 'Tesla also noted that former employee Carlos Aranda tweeted in April that he had received a $207 donation with a comment “compliments of $TSLAQ” to a GoFundMe he started to cover losses from injuries he said he sustained on the job, which made it impossible for him to work. $TSLAQ is a shorthand term on Twitter used to describe investors who have shorted the stock.', 'Follow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech industry news.']"

Along with the call, he kept the price target at $150.', 'According to Post, the acquisition is expected to add 625,000 square feet of U.S. manufacturing capacity to Peloton, adding on to its existing capacity in Taiwan. “This capacity is likely underutilized today due to the pandemic, and is expected to come online for Peloton products by next Holiday,” he commented.', 'Further explaining his take on the deal, Post stated, “In our view, Precor may have been looking for a buyer given financial pressure on gym and other customers in 2020, creating an opportunity for Peloton. We see Precor’s equipment as relatively high quality, and a good fit for Peloton to both build US manufacturing capacity for Holiday 2021, and to help establish a presence in new commercial markets.”', 'It should be noted that Post doesn’t believe the purchase will be a solution for near-term supply constraints, but it could help limit future shipping risks.', 'The bottom line?

Additionally, its 2020 adjusted EBITDA could come in at over $10 million, according to estimates.', '“We believe the acquisition is highly complementary given BrightTALK’s proprietary first-party purchase intent data, addition of virtual event capabilities to TTGT platform, cross selling opportunities, and increases TTGT long-term subscription revenues,” Kessler opined.', 'Online events are likely here to stay, in Kessler’s opinion, and while the company used to have an events segment, it didn’t launch a virtual events platform. “The addition of video/ webinar content to TechTarget websites should also help attract more users and better positions TTGT’s ~140 websites going forward,” the analyst explained.', 'All of this puts TechTarget on track to generate higher Q4 revenues/EBITDA, with Kessler now calling for $43.4 million, up from $42.6 million.

Near-term, we are focused on the entry into new states like MI and VA,” McTernan mentioned.', 'Most important, however, for the company will be “the outlook for new legislation,” in McTernan’s opinion.', '“As states evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on their budgets we continue to believe it will push states to consider OSB and iGaming legislation. This scenario appears to potentially be playing out in NY as a $15 billion state deficit and question marks on if and how much federal aid the state will get has seemingly driven opponents of the bill, like Governor Cuomo to potentially be a support,” McTernan said.', 'According to TipRanks, McTernan is tracking an 78% success rate and 36.9% average return per rating.', 'Fellow Raymond James analyst Brian Peterson just gave RingCentral a thumbs up, with the analyst bumping up the price target from $355 to the Street-high of $450.

So Jassy picked a person he trusts to replace him as the head of the Amazon unit providing cloud tools for hosting websites and applications.', 'Now it will be up to Adam Selipsky, who was Jassy’s right-hand man up until a few years ago when he left to become CEO of Tableau Software, to build on Amazon’s already impressive lead.', 'AWS controlled 47% of the cloud infrastructure market in the first half of 2020, according to estimates from industry observer IDC, more than the next four providers put together: Microsoft, Alibaba, Google and IBM.', 'Like Jassy, Selipsky saw AWS grow up and immerses himself in the details across many topics. As recently as 2016, when he gave up his position of vice president for sales, marketing and support, Selipsky sat in on Jassy’s back-to-back “chop” meetings to discuss proposals.', 'While Jassy was the last person to comment, Selipsky was second to last, said Jay Wampold, marketing chief of cloud-development start-up Pulumi and a former AWS product marketing director.', 'Amazon workers for decades have leaned on 14 leadership principles such as “customer obsession” and “bias for action.” People who know him said Selipsky embodied those principles, like Jassy. He’s also well acquainted with Amazon’s practice of coming up with fake press releases and frequently-asked-questions documents for potential products. It probably won’t take long for Selipsky to remember the rhythm of working at Amazon.', 'But one thing that distinguishes Selipsky from other candidates is that he ran analytics software company Tableau, both as a publicly traded company and as a part of Salesforce. Under Selipsky, Tableau’s stock rose as revenue growth accelerated and he led a shift from selling one-time software licenses to subscriptions. He then helped sell it to Salesforce in 2019 for $15.7 billion, which was the company’s biggest acquisition ever at the time.', '“More and more, organizations are demanding subscription purchasing options for all of their software, and data analytics is no different. It’s no surprise why, as with subscription, our customers get the full power and simplicity of Tableau with lower risk, lower upfront investment and more flexibility,” Selipsky told analysts on a 2017 conference call. The push succeeded: By 2019 84% of Tableau’s revenue came from subscriptions.', 'Leading Tableau gave Selipsky greater exposure to the complexities of selling software for non-technical users, said Jay Heglar, chief business officer of Tableau competitor Domo and formerly an AWS sales leader who worked with Selipsky. Now, Heglar said, Selipsky can go back and try to boost adoption of the cloud applications offered by AWS, which historically have not been as popular as its low-level computing, storage and database products.', 'For example, being at Tableau meant allying with resellers that can get software into large accounts, Heglar said. Selipsky could call for Amazon to refine its approach there to promote applications such as the Amazon Chime video-calling service -- which is far from a household name like Zoom, or even Skype.', 'Working at Salesforce might have given Selipsky some new perspective on how to make AWS even bigger. Salesforce spent four times as much on sales and marketing as on research and development in its last fiscal year, showing its emphasis on selling.', '“Make it easy to do business. Make it easy to buy a platform,” said Manny Medina, CEO of sales software start-up Outreach and member of the Amazon team that started what became AWS. “Sell me a vision. Good old salesmanship -- you need a little bit of Keith Block in that organization.” Block joined Salesforce from Oracle in 2013 and was elevated to co-CEO alongside Marc Benioff before he resigned in February 2020.', 'Medina said it would be helpful if AWS could sell customers technology even if it’s not quite available yet -- a sales tactic that Oracle has employed in the past. “If you want to grow, you have to make promises for things that you don’t yet have,” one former Oracle employee was quoted as saying.', 'Medina also said Selipsky could make a difference if he can make AWS simpler for users. This week a small cloud-infrastructure provider called DigitalOcean, which touts the simplicity of its services and billing practices, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.', 'Selipsky will have to contend with a resurgent Microsoft.', 'When Selipsky left Amazon, Microsoft was still bolstering its portfolio with Azure services to match what Amazon could deliver, and Microsoft was still rolling out data centers around the world to boost capacity. Those are not big issues anymore. Microsoft has become more successful at convincing longtime Windows and Office customers to try Azure, in part by encouraging its salespeople to focus on getting customers to use it, instead of just pay for it.', 'Since 2016, Microsoft has also begun using Amazon’s own behavior against it. Microsoft executives regularly say that companies don’t want to do business with a IT services company that competes with them in other arenas -- a jab at Amazon’s continuous expansion from e-commerce into shipping, pharmacy, grocery stores and more.', 'Selipsky will have to respond to that line of inquiry, just as Jassy has. (Amazon has said that “for customers who’ve built meaningful offerings with significant functionality, we’ve yet to see these companies struggle to keep growing simply because AWS offers something in that area, too.”)', 'Whatever Microsoft is doing, it’s working. Azure now appears to be close to eclipsing Office as Microsoft’s largest business by revenue. IDC estimates indicate that AWS lost market share in the first half of 2021 compared with the first half of 2020, while Microsoft gained share.

Restaurants in the rest of New York state are permitted to have 75% indoor capacity instead of half, according to policies from Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo.', 'The relaxing of pandemic rules in New York and other parts of the country is happening as more Americans are vaccinated against Covid-19.

Still, top U.S. health officials have warned about becoming too complacent and forgoing all virus mitigation measures.', 'The restaurant industry has been under pressure since the start of the pandemic, facing a range of restrictions and health mandates that altered operations, as well as a cautious portion of the population who avoided dining out even when it’s been allowed in their locale.', 'Many restaurants have pivoted to place a greater emphasis on takeout and delivery, leading to a surge in usage of third-party apps such as Uber Eats and DoorDash. Nevertheless, tens of thousands of establishments have closed during the pandemic.', 'Despite the industry’s past pain, Meyer said he thinks there are valuable lessons for Union Square Hospitality Group and other operators going forward.', '“Over this past year, we either went from no cake at all to, at best, some birthday cake and no icing. Now what we have is the possibility to have it all,” said Meyer, who also founded Shake Shack and serves as chairman of its board.', '“Digital ordering with takeout, delivery, pickup, selling wine out the door, shipping food across the country on Goldbelly — so many of those things that we learned to do during the pandemic are going to stick,” Meyer said.', 'The opportunity to offer outdoor dining on sidewalks or in repurposed streets has been a key pandemic lifeline and a boon going forward, Meyer said. Democratic New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has said the city’s program will become permanent.', '“Most of us never had outdoor dining. When we get to the point where we’re 100% indoor, plus outdoor dining, shipping, takeout, delivery, it’s going to be better than it’s ever been,” Meyer said. “I’m not Pollyanna about our business.

They should have had logistics in place in advance.”', 'A more worrisome problem would be if Tesla built these cars and now doesn’t have customers willing to take them.

In July it offered free lifetime use of its network of fast-charging stations to customers who bought the “performance” version of the Model 3, which starts at $64,000.

Mr. Musk acknowledged in a tweet that the offer was not economically “sustainable.”', 'The company also held a “sales event” in early September at its factory in Fremont, Calif., where potential customers could browse among a few hundred Model 3s and pick one to buy. Later in the month the company sent emails offering free overnight test drives of its Model S luxury sedan and its Model X sport-utility vehicle, another move that suggests Tesla is trying to stimulate demand.', 'In some cases, cars have been marked — with a bar-coded sticker or with grease pencil on the windshield — to indicate that they are inventory vehicles, meaning they have no customers awaiting them. Some markings indicate repairs required before the cars can be sold, like scratches, dents or components that don’t work.', 'That was the case with cars in a lot in Scottsdale, Ariz., that was photographed in mid-September by The New York Times.', 'Mr. Arnold, the Tesla spokesman, declined to explain why those cars were being stockpiled and how they figured into the company’s production numbers.', 'In the rush to ramp up Model 3 production, Tesla has faced growing issues with vehicle quality.

After he gave the green light, Malek produced 2,500 face shields, and shipped the first boxes this week to hospitals that have asked for donations, including Children’s National in Washington, D.C. He’s put his business on the back burner for the moment to focus on PPE.', '“I had an epiphany, if our health-care workers start reducing in number it’s going to be catastrophic for everyone,” Malek said. “I realized I could have greater impact if I focused on the health-care pros on the frontline.”', 'Individual makers and small groups are mobilizing during this crisis because of a dire lack of PPE across the country, which has waves of doctors and nurses asking for help.', 'In California, officials stockpiled 21 million face masks for emergencies, but many of them were expired. California distributed the masks to frontline medical workers anyway. In New York City, the center of the outbreak in the United States, Mayor Bill DeBlasio said this week that New York has only enough N95 masks to last through the end of the week. The federal government is asking agencies that might have stashes of spare medical supplies to redistribute them to hospital staffs and emergency responders as the national stockpile runs low.

Arash has an intake form on his website and he says he has been surprised by the number of medical workers asking for face shields.

At its most basic, a face shield is a piece of clear, non-porous plastic to protect health workers’ faces from coming into direct contact with saliva droplets that may contain the virus.', 'Face shields are supposed to be worn in conjunction with other PPE, like surgical or N95 masks, and can make them last longer. That means the shields don’t need to be made to strict medical-grade specifications.', '“The overall specifications to build those are not going to be as stringent as a face mask or respirator,”  said Dr. Sanjay Kurani, medical director at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. ', 'Santa Clara Valley Medical Center worked with a Sunnyvale, California, nonprofit called Maker Nexus to create a face shield design that can be used at the hospital and reproduced in large quantities. The supplies are critical given that one COVID-19 patient might require doctors and nurses to use 30 sets of PPE per day on that patient alone, Kurani said. ', 'Santa Clara County in California was one of the first places in the U.S. to report community-spread coronavirus cases, and it’s been watching its PPE supplies closely. It’s under a shelter-in-place order until May 3 and there are currently 277 hospitalized patients in the county that are diagnosed with or suspected to have COVID-19.', 'The hospital has an infection prevention team evaluating PPE donations, and the staff appreciates the help. ', '“It has surprised us to the point where people are almost in tears that there are others supporting us and what’s happening while we’re socially distancing,” Kurani said. “To feel connected to the community this way is a huge morale booster.”', 'Maker Nexus typically provides machining tools for its members to fabricate new prototypes, but under shelter-in-place they’re using 3D-printing to produce face masks, and making the design public. Maker Nexus cofounder Jim Schrempp said that the effort from people with fabrication skills reminded him of WWII-era “victory gardens,” when the government encouraged people to grow their own food to help with supply.', '“Demand for PPE has ballooned, and the response is happening all over maker spaces,” Schrempp said, adding that if demand for face shields falls because there’s enough supply, there are additional ideas and requests for PPE that the organization would love to make. ', 'Getting help from medical professionals to optimize the face shields is a critical step in the process. Schrempp said that their design went through seven or eight iterations to make it safer, including lengthening the shield, limiting attachment points, and adding a top covering.', 'Organizations with greater capacity are mobilizing, too. Gustavo Fontana, an industrial designer who cofounded Fresco Design, said that he’s been working with a group called Ushield, which has found a factory in the Northeast that can produce as many as 100,000 face shields per day from readily available plastic. His first “pilot run” shipment of 4,200 shields went out to hospitals across the country this week.', '“Every day you can get an extra shield faster to a worker, it’s potentially lifesaving for that person,” Fontana said. ', 'Now, big firms with corporate expertise in supply chains and manufacturing are getting involved making face shields as well. Apple is making 1 million face shields per week, and its design comes with professionally made usage guidelines and assembly directions. Ford has donated face shields to Michigan hospitals as well as the New York police and fire departments. Nike is using materials originally intended for sneakers in its face shield design that’s being shipped to hospitals in Oregon. ', 'The little guys don’t mind the big companies joining in on the mobilization effort — to them, the point is to help out the health-care workers on the frontlines who are fighting the outbreak and incurring personal risk. In fact, many makers said, expensive techniques available to big firms such as injection molding could result in better shields at a large scale.

', 'Despite a lack of reserves that caused dayslong blackouts last winter, Texas often has some of the world’s lowest energy prices, and its share of renewables is growing over time, with 20% of its power coming from wind as of 2019. It has a deregulated power grid that lets customers choose between power providers, and crucially, its political leaders are very pro-crypto – dream conditions for a miner looking for a kind welcome and cheap energy sources.', '“You are going to see a dramatic shift over the next few months,” said Brandon Arvanaghi, previously a security engineer at crypto exchange Gemini. “We have governors like Greg Abbott in Texas who are promoting mining. It is going to become a real industry in the United States, which is going to be incredible.”', '2021 data for the global distribution of mining power is not yet available, but past estimates have shown that 65% to 75% of the world’s bitcoin mining happened in China – mostly in four Chinese provinces: Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Sichuan and Yunnan. Sichuan and Yunnan’s hydropower make them renewable energy meccas, while Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia are home to many of China’s coal plants. ', 'The drawdown in miners has already begun in Inner Mongolia. After failing to meet Beijing’s climate targets, province leaders decided to give bitcoin miners two months to clear out, explicitly blaming its energy misses on crypto mines. ', 'Castle Island Ventures founding partner Nic Carter says that while it’s not totally clear how China will handle next steps, a phased rollout is likely. “It seems like we’re going from policy statement to actual implementation in relatively short order,” he said.', 'The way this exodus is measured is by looking at hashrate, an industry term used to describe the computing power of all miners in the bitcoin network.', '“Given the drop in hashrate, it appears likely that installations are being turned off throughout the country,” continued Carter, who also thinks that probably 50% to 60% of bitcoin’s entire hashrate will ultimately leave China. ', 'Although China’s announcement hasn’t been cemented in policy, that isn’t stopping miners like Alejandro De La Torre from cutting their losses and making an exit.', '“We do not want to face every single year, some sort of new ban coming in China,” said De La Torre, vice president of Hong Kong-headquartered mining pool Poolin. “So we’re trying to diversify our global mining hashrate, and that’s why we are moving to the United States and to Canada.”', 'One of bitcoin’s greatest features is that it is totally location agnostic. Miners only require an internet connection, unlike other industries that must be relatively close to their end users. ', '“The cool thing about bitcoin that is underappreciated by a lot of the naysayers is that it’s a portable market; you can bring it right to the source of energy,” said Steve Barbour, founder of Upstream Data, a company that manufactures and supplies portable mining solutions for oil and gas facilities.', 'That said, the exodus won’t be instantaneous, in part, because it will take miners some time to either move their machines out of China or liquidate their assets and set up shop elsewhere. ', 'Because miners at scale compete in a low-margin industry, where their only variable cost is typically energy, they are incentivized to migrate to the world’s cheapest sources of power. ', '“Every Western mining host I know has had their phones ringing off the hook,” said Carter. “Chinese miners or miners that were domiciled in China are looking to Central Asia, Eastern Europe, the U.S. and Northern Europe.”', 'One likely destination is China’s next-door neighbor, Kazakhstan. The country’s coal mines provide a cheap and abundant energy supply. It also helps that Kazakhstan has a more lax attitude about building, which bodes well for miners who need to construct physical installations in a short period of time. ', 'Didar Bekbauov runs Xive, a company that provides hosting services to international miners. Xive also sells the specialized equipment needed for mining. ', 'Bekbauov says that he’s stopped counting the number of Chinese miners who have called him to ask about relocation options, ranging from operations with 15 rigs to thousands. ', '“One miner told us that only government electricity plants have restricted mining and private ones will continue to service miners,” Bekbauov told CNBC. ', '“But most of the electricity is generated by government power plants, so miners will have to move. That makes them uncertain and desperate to find other locations,” he said.', 'Whether Kazakhstan is a destination or simply a stopover on a longer migration west remains to be seen. ', 'Arvanaghi is bullish on North America and thinks the hashrate there will grow over the next few months.', '“Texas not only has the cheapest electricity in the U.S. but some of the cheapest in the globe,” he said. “It’s also very easy to start up a mining company ... if you have $30 million, $40 million, you can be a premier miner in the United States.”', 'Wyoming has also trended toward being pro-bitcoin and could be another mining destination, according to Arvanaghi.', 'There are, however, a few major limitations to the U.S. becoming a global mining destination.', 'For one, the lead time to build the actual physical infrastructure necessary to host miners is likely six to nine months, Carter told CNBC. “The U.S. probably can’t be as nimble as other countries in terms of onshoring these stray miners,” he said.', 'The move logistics may also prove difficult. There is a shipping container shortage, thanks to the tail winds of the Covid pandemic. ', 'But perhaps the biggest question is the reliability of the Texas power grid. A storm that devastated large swaths of the state in 2021 has reignited a debate over whether Texas should winter-proof its systems, a potentially costly project that might affect taxes or other fees for those looking to tap into the state’s power grid. More recently, ERCOT, the organization that operates Texas’ grid, asked consumers to conserve energy amid what officials called an unusual number of “forced generation outages” and an upcoming heat wave.', 'Tesla CEO Elon Musk has bashed bitcoin mining, claiming that it is bad for the environment. It’s not a new criticism.', 'For years, skeptics have maligned the world’s most popular digital token for polluting the planet, while supporters have extolled the virtues of bitcoin and its role in accelerating the rise of renewable energy. ', 'It is unclear whether the China mining exodus will make or break the case for bitcoin enthusiasts in the debate around the token’s carbon footprint. The dominant narrative, to date, has been that much of the world’s bitcoin is mined with Chinese goal. ', '“From a narrative perspective, it’s definitely an improvement,” said Carter. “But China also has the most abundant stranded hydro resources in the world.”', 'The country offers significant energy vectors from wind, solar and especially hydropower in the south. Xinjiang’s grid, for example, is 35% powered by wind and solar energy inputs.If all the miners do end up leaving China, it will mean less fossil fuel-powered mining, but it will also mean that the network’s share of renewable energy-powered mining will drop. This is why the question of where these migrant miners end up could prove critical to bitcoin’s future. “It’s the biggest story of the year for bitcoin,” said Carter. ', 'De La Torre says they’re looking to expand operations using green energy, a trend that is already years in the making. He says that hydro plants are generally cheaper than fossil fuels in most parts of the world.', '“Mining is price sensitive, so as to seek out the lowest cost power and the lowest cost power tends to be renewable because if you’re burning fossil fuels...it has extraction, refinement and transport costs,” explained Blockstream CEO Adam Back. ', 'Each year, investment bank Lazard releases a breakdown of energy costs by source. Its 2020 report shows that many of the most common renewable energy sources are either equal to or less expensive than conventional energy sources like coal and gas. And the cost of renewable power keeps going down.', 'But there are limitations to running crypto mines purely on renewable energy.', 'Though solar and wind are now the world’s least expensive energy sources, both power supplies face limitations at scale, so there is concern over the viability of miners turning exclusively to wind or solar energy.', 'For the time being, there isn’t that much mining capacity worldwide that is ready to absorb the Chinese miner diaspora. While they scramble to find a new home, we could see hashrate go offline – and stay offline. ', 'In practice, that would mean all the remaining miners are more profitable for a period of time. ', 'Having more geographic dispersion would even out the global balance of power, and it would also reduce the ability of any one sovereign nation to co-opt or control the network.', 'We may also see special crypto economic zones pop up in the next few months.', '“You will see jurisdictions adopting a very favorable stance and creating the equivalent of special zones to encourage miners to host locally,” said Carter. “We’re seeing it at the state level here. You’re also going to see it at the country level, you might even see subsidized electricity for mining.”', 'Correction: A storm devastated large swaths of Texas in 2021.

76,A brewing U.S.-China tech cold war rattles the semiconductor industry,2020-09-18T13:11:32+0000,"['As trade tensions mount between the U.S. and China, the U.S. semiconductor industry fears a tech cold war could disrupt the global supply chain. Now companies on both sides of the Pacific are trying to develop strategies to mitigate risk — whether it’s hoarding supplies or looking at shifting the location of production facilities.', ' Last week Trump administration announced that it is considering imposing export restrictions on Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, China’s largest manufacturer of semiconductors. That’s the latest crackdown by Washington as it tightens restrictions against Chinese tech companies such as Huawei, preventing them from obtaining chips without a special license.', 'The issue prompted SEMI, an industry group, to draft a letter for Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross explaining how blacklisting SMIC could hurt the U.S. tech industry, Reuters has reported. “We urge the Department to carefully consider the immediate and long-term detrimental impacts to U.S. industry, economic and national security that may result from the addition of SMIC to the Entity List,” said the group, which has 2,400 members worldwide, including SMIC and U.S. chip equipment makers Lam Research Corp  and Applied Materials.', 'While some U.S. firms such as Intel and Micron Technology still make chips in the United States, the industry’s center of gravity has shifted to Asia, where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) has more than half of the overall market for contract manufacturing chips and an even stronger hold on the most advanced chips. Firms, including iPhone maker Apple, Qualcomm and Nvidia all rely on TSMC and other Asian foundries to manufacture their chips.', 'Untangling the global supply chain in this interconnected industry is not feasible – at least in the foreseeable future, industry experts concur. Components for a chip could travel more than 25,000 miles before completion and can cross borders more than 70 times before a final product is delivered to the end customer, explains Syed Alam, Accenture’s global semiconductor practice lead.', 'Industry sources believe the best way to address the issue is to bring back more domestic manufacturing, develop a robust industry ecosystem, invest more in R&D and maintain America’s lead in advanced product design. An amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act shows Washington recognizes that boosting domestic manufacturing and R&D is key for national security and global competitiveness. The U.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity has been cut in half to just 12% over the past 20 years and is forecast to fall to 10% by 2023. ', 'The amendment was a compromised version of two bills that have bipartisan support. The CHIPS for America Act which stands for “Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors,” creates a 40% investment tax credit for semiconductor equipment, a $10 billion fund to match any chip manufacturing incentive programs at the state level, and $12 billion in R&D funding to be allocated over the next five to 10 years.', 'In addition, it provides support for semiconductor-based research grants to U.S. universities or private companies, either directly or through agencies like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). It also calls for the creation of a National Semiconductor Technology Center, which could serve as a clearinghouse and organizational control point for U.S.-based chip manufacturing, as well as a critical new research and development facility.', 'The other bill was the American Foundries Act, which authorizes the Department of Commerce to offer $15 billion in grants to states to assist in  the construction, expansion, or modernization of microelectronics fabrication, assembly, test, advanced packaging, or advanced research and development facilities. It also would give $5 billion in federal investments to promote semiconductor research at the Department of Defense, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The bill also mandates that the White House Office of Science and Technology, in coordination with federal research agencies and the private sector, develop a plan to guide funding for advancing next-generation semiconductors.', '“We believe these grants and incentives are critical for the U.S. semiconductor industry especially for state-of-the-art advanced technology,” says Jeff Rittener, chief government affairs office at Intel. “We need help from the U.S. government to create a level playing field.” As he explains over time U.S. manufacturing stateside has been shrinking and that puts the country at risk since America will be reliant on foreign sources on the brains that run modern technology.', 'These incentives are key considering chip factories can cost up to $15 billion to build, with much of the expense in the form of pricey tools. China and many other countries have spent billions of dollars bolstering their domestic chip manufacturing industry and they offer tax and financial incentives to lure foreign manufacturers. In the Made in China 2025 Plan, the Chinese government has committed $120 billion to shore up domestic semiconductor manufacturing with the goal of producing 70% of all chips need for local consumption.', 'According to a recent report from the Semiconductor Industry Association in partnership with the Boston Consulting Group,  robust federal incentives valued at $50 billion would create as many as 19 major semiconductor manufacturing facilities and 70,000 high-paying jobs in the U.S. over the next 10 years. Strengthening U.S. chip manufacturing will help ensure America out-innovates the world in the strategic technologies of the future — AI, 5G, quantum computing — that will determine global economic and military leadership for decades to come. ', '“The country that leads in advanced chip research, design, and manufacturing will have a big leg up in the global race to deploy new game-changing technologies, such as 5G, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing,” said John Neuffer, president and CEO of the Semiconductor Industry Association. “Leaders in Washington should seize this opportunity, level the global playing field to attract chip production, and invest boldly in domestic manufacturing incentives and research initiatives that will strengthen U.S. tech leadership for decades to come.” ', '“The U.S. has always had a tremendous lead in thought leadership and intellectual property in the semiconductor industry but now China poses a real threat since they are subsidizing a tremendous amount in R&D,” says Bob O’Donnell, president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research. Chinese government is currently making aggressive subsidized investments in building over 60 semiconductor manufacturing plants (commonly called foundries or “fabs”, which is short for fabrication sites).', 'Some companies are mulling over how to expand operations in the U.S. According to Rittener, Intel is investing in expanding at its locations in the U.S.  It has hired 3,000 new employees and is getting ready to open a new microprocessor plant in Chandler, Arizona.', '“Intel has also had conversations with the U.S. government about developing a foundry for advanced semiconductors,” Rittener says, “but there are no concrete plans yet.”', 'Other industry titans have already taken action. In May, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. – a big supplier for Apple and Huawei -- announced it was investing $12 billion to build  a second U.S. manufacturing plant in Arizona. The factory will be focused on producing so-called 5-nanometer chips, the latest in semiconductor technology being manufactured today. Construction will begin next year;  it’s expected to be operational in 2024.', 'For Huawei, the world’s biggest smartphone maker, the trade war has taken a toll. The company, which bought $20.8 billion worth of chips last year, has been hoarding chip supplies because of U.S. sanctions and gradually shifting design and chip production to mainland China.', 'The U.S. has accused Huawei of building backdoors into network infrastructure, ostensibly to aid Chinese government spying efforts, which Huawei has denied. Despite those denials, the Trump administration placed Huawei and 114 of its affiliates on its Entity List in May 2019, which meant US firms were unable to sell technology to the company without explicit US government approval. Since then the entity list has grown to include 150 companies. in May, the US Commerce Department issued an amended export rule to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei to “strategically target Huawei’s acquisition of semiconductors that are the direct product of certain US software and technology.”', 'That rule prevented foreign manufacturers of semiconductors who use American software and technology in their operations from shipping their products to Huawei unless they first obtained a license from the US. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world, reportedly halted orders for Huawei’s HiSilicon unit in May following the new U.S. rule.', 'Now industry observers worry about any retailiation from China. “Given such sanctions significantly impact Huawei, there could be retaliation from China,” said Sebastian Hou at CLSA, according to Ars Technica. He named Apple, Huawei’s competitor in the smartphone market, and Qualcomm as potential targets.', 'Others industry titans continue to diversify operations in other parts of the globe. Last week, Nvidia announced a $40 billion deal to buy Arm Holdings from SoftBank. Arm designs the architecture for mobile chips used in almost every mobile device in the world, from the Apple iPhone to just practically every Android device. For Nvidia, whose chips are widely used to support graphics and artificial intelligence applications, including for self-driving vehicles, the deal will help boost its data center business.', 'While large manufacturers have the financial wherewithal and industry connections to navigate through disruptions in the supply chain, many small and mid-size tech manufacturers in the U.S. do not.', 'One is Social Mobile, a Miami-based consultancy and OEM that specializes in making customized Android Enterprise devices for Fortune 500 companies. The company, which also has operations in San Francisco, Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China, started seeing disruptions from suppliers in February and the situation is getting worse.', ' “There has been a shakeup in the industry,”  says CEO Robert Morco. “There are longer lead times for procuring semiconductors and prices have also risen. In some cases it takes double the time to get supplies. Some suppliers are only making them available for key clients. That has forced many companies to go to the grey market for chips.”', 'According to Morcos, “the big guns will get through this, but it’s harder for small and medium-sized businesses. We are feeling the impact of this trend the most. We are the ones that are being affected by a lack of transparency, price gauging and the lack of product availability.”', 'To navigate the crisis, Morcos says Social Mobile is asking customers to place orders early due to delays. Looking ahead the company is looking at building a plant in the U.S. with some sort of government support. “There is a lot of local, state and federal interest in onshoring semiconductor manufacturing right now, so we feel we are in the right place at the right time,” says Morcos.', 'O’Donnell notes that many of his clients are looking at U.S.-China trade and geopolitical tensions and its making semiconductor companies nervous. “There is a lot of saber-rattling going on right now between China and Taiwan,” he notes.', '“This has tech companies in many industries rethinking their semiconductor roadmap,” says Alam. As he explains, the U.S. just doesn’t need to build more chip plants, it needs to build an entire semiconductor ecosystem and attract the talent it needs to maintain the industry’s competitive edge.', '“It would be great to bring more manufacturing home,” says Gene Sheridan, CEO of Navitas Semiconductor, a start-up in El Segundo, California, that manufactures next-generation gallium nitride power chips in Taiwan and the Philippines for companies like Lenovo, AUKEY and Anker.', '“Trade tensions as well as the pandemic reminds us of the inherent risk of manufacturing mostly abroad.”', ' ', ' ']"

Those services will be under a new division of the company called Walgreens Health.', '“This new Walgreens Health will make a difference and will began to transform us away from retail and just dispensing pharmaceuticals,” she said in an interview with CNBC’s Bertha Coombs. “It will be about the lives that we manage, and the lives that we touch and the lives that we can wrap physician and clinicians around in our buildings, both physically and digitally.”', 'Investors appeared receptive to Walgreens’ plan. Shares closed up 7.4% at $50.77 on Thursday. So far this year, shares are up more than 29%.', 'Brian Tanquilut, an equity research analyst for Jefferies, said Walgreens delivered on what many investors wanted Thursday by spelling out how it will become a proactive health-care player.', '“Right now, people are saying, ‘It’s a sound strategy and we’ll give you a little bit of credit for that’” he said.', 'Walgreen’s plan calls for opening hundreds of primary care clinics, shaking up its selection of front-of-store merchandise and taking a stake in several health-care companies.', 'The company expects that strategy to pay off in the coming years. Next year, adjusted earnings per share are expected to show flat growth on a constant currency basis, it said. But growth will accelerate so that adjusted earnings per share will rise about 4% annually over the next three years. Beyond fiscal 2024, the company’s growth algorithm will lead to adjusted earnings per share growth of between 11% and 13%.', 'Brewer pointed to the company’s fourth-quarter earnings as evidence that Walgreens is building on a firm foundation.', 'Tanquilut said the new vision for Walgreens is a notable pivot.', '“You are making the pharmacy a health center,” he said. “Instead of having a retail focus, the driver of value is no longer driving scripts [prescriptions] out of the pharmacy. It’s actually delivering care and making the patient loyal to the store.”', 'It recently decided to invest an additional $5.2 billion in VillageMD, a primary care company that will run clinics inside of Walgreens stores and is on track to go public in 2022. It also acquired a majority stake in home health-care company, CareCentrix, and specialty pharmacy company, Shields Health Solutions.', 'Along with ramping up on health-care services, Walgreens will step up its cost savings goal to $3.3 billion by 2024. It decided to raise that goal after shaving off $2 billion in costs, Chief Financial Officer James Kehoe said.', 'Brewer stepped into the top leadership role of Walgreens in mid-March after serving as chief operating officer of Starbucks and CEO of Walmart-owned Sam’s Club.', 'She said for her, the health-care mission is personal. At the company’s investor day, she recalled the final months of her mother’s life, when her family juggled medical bills, numerous doctors and kidney dialysis appointments. The experience, she said, was “incredibly confusing and unwieldly and burdensome.”', 'She said that distracted her family from what should have been the focus: enjoying the remaining time she had with her mom.', 'For so many Americans, she said that is the same experience — and one that Walgreens aims to solve by weaving together primary care with pharmacies and freeing up more of employees’ time to help patients.', 'Over the next few years, Walgreens leaders say consumers will start to see and feel the difference when they walk into neighborhood stores.', 'Walgreens said it will have 85 primary-care clinics in stores by the end of the year. They will be under the name Village Medical at Walgreens. It plans to have at least 600 of the doctor offices in more than 30 U.S. markets by 2025 and 1,000 by 2027. More than half of them will be in parts of the country that are medically underserved.', 'In some stores and online, it will add Walgreens Health Corners. The in-store spaces will be staffed by medical professionals, such as nurses and pharmacists, who can consult with patients and help them manage chronic conditions.', 'So far, Walgreens has opened 40 of them. It plans to have more than 100 by the end of this fiscal year and to ultimately have more than 3,000 across its stores.  ', 'Customers will be able to get other kinds of medical tests, such as for pneumonia, strep, HIV and sexually transmitted infections, Walgreens President John Standley said. He said the company already has pilots, including a testing pilot for HIV in two states that it expects to grow to $26 million in revenue by fiscal year 2024.', 'To free up pharmacists’ time to answer customer questions, administer vaccinations and give other medical tests, Walgreens is opening centralized centers that fill prescriptions and ship them to stores and people’s homes, Standley said. It already has two centers open in Dallas and Phoenix and plans to open an additional nine by the end of fiscal year 2022, which will bring the number of pharmacies served to around 3,900.', 'In the front of the store, the company’s merchandise will have “more a spin towards healthy for you,” Brewer said in a CNBC interview. Already, she said, Walgreens has seen consumers gravitate on their own toward supplements and beauty products with a wellness bent. She said it will add more private label products, too.', 'She said Walgreens will take a hard look at tobacco sales. It has continued to sell cigarettes, even after rival CVS Health dropped the products in 2014.', 'With the strategy, Walgreens is following a similar path as rival CVS Health — but with a major caveat. CVS is an insurance provider, too. It acquired Aetna in 2018 in a $69 billion merger.

78,Former Chewy CEO tries to push GameStop to become the Amazon of the video-game industry,2020-11-21T13:00:01+0000,"['The shift away from brick-and-mortar retailers in favor of online shopping has hurt GameStop over the past decade, pushing the company’s stock down nearly 40% in that time period.', 'But Ryan Cohen, the former CEO of Chewy, thinks the maligned video-fame retailer can turn itself around by shifting its focus away from physical stores in favor of a building robust e-commerce platform. Cohen thinks GameStop can use its brand and large customer base to make that transition. He has taken a large stake in the company to try and push it in that direction.', 'Business: GameStop is a retailer that sells video game hardware, physical and digital video game software, video game accessories, as well as mobile and consumer electronics products and other merchandise primarily through retail operations, with all stores engaged in the sale of new and pre-owned video game systems, software and accessories.', 'Stock Market Value: $828 million ($12.71 per share)', 'Percentage Ownership: 9.98%', 'Average Cost: $5.98', 'Activist Commentary: Cohen is not an activist but an extremely successful entrepreneur. Cohen is the co-founder and former CEO of e-commerce company Chewy, which he built up and sold to PetSmart in 2017 for $3.35 billion. Cohen remained CEO following the acquisition until March 2018, and in June 2019, Chewy went public at a valuation of $8.7 billion. This is Cohen’s first 13D filing, but what he lacks in activist experience he makes up for in strategic and operational qualifications in building and running a company in the digital era, giving him a ton of credibility here, even more so than the average activist with respect to certain areas.', 'On Nov. 16, 2020, Cohen sent a letter to the company’s board, urging them to immediately conduct a strategic review and to provide stockholders with a credible and publicly available roadmap for cost containment, prioritizing profitable retail locations and geographic markets and building the e-commerce ecosystem.', 'Cohen resorted to this public letter because his private attempts were not productive. GameStop sells video games and consoles and has been bearishly compared to Blockbuster. Cohen does not make that direct analogy, but he certainly paints the picture of a company that is on that same path if it does not change.', 'Sales have declined from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 (before the last console cycle) to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2019; EBITDA has dropped from $839 million in 2011 to only $111 million in 2019; net income has fallen from $339 million in 2011 to a loss of $470 million in 2019; and in the two most recent quarters alone, the company lost another $277 million. All of this happened while the size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle. Cohen sees a company that is stuck in a brick-and-mortar mentality and is unwilling to embrace the digital mindset necessary to grow with gamers.', 'However, Cohen also sees a company with valuable assets, including a strong brand and large customer base and a path to success and shareholder value. He believes the company can be the ultimate destination for gamers, but that destination must start with a strong e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high touch experience that excites and delights customers, including content and community. It needs to become the Amazon of gaming, with the added expertise and specialized customer service as a key differentiator.', 'To do this, Cohen urges the company to cut excessive real estate costs, streamline or sell non-core operations in Europe and Australia and hire the right talent. While Cohen does not specifically target CEO George Sherman, he does note that Sherman has substantial experience working for large brick-and-mortar retailers such as Advance Auto Parts, Best Buy and Target and is committed to a twentieth century focus on physical stores and walk-in sales despite the transition to an always-on digital world.', 'The company is at an inflection point to make this change. Cohen notes that the company will be able to temporarily mask some of its issues with the new console cycle that will appear to validate its adherence to an outdated business model that is overdependent on brick-and-mortar sales. However, it is also this new console cycle and additional sales that can provide the cash flow to finance this strategy change into the future as the global gaming market is expected to reach $174.9 billion this year and $217.9 billion by 2023. ', 'Cohen alludes to the fact that one board seat would not be acceptable to him as he wants the company to actually focus on a shift in mindset. This would require at least two — and probably three or more — new directors to the ten-person board, depending on who is replaced. While it looks like Cohen might have an ally on the board in James Symancyk, the CEO of PetSmart while Cohen was running Chewy, Symancyk also has a brick-and-mortar background and might not see it the same way Cohen does.', 'If this does end up going to a proxy fight, Cohen seems like the type of shareholder who will take it the distance if necessary. In that case, he would have two potential headwinds. First, the company recently added four new directors through settlements and nominations by shareholders. That could be enough to placate certain institutional shareholders and ISS if they do not see as dire of a situation as Cohen does in this ultra-fast-moving industry. Second, a large part of the shareholder base is comprised of index funds such as BlackRock (12.12%), Vanguard (8.12%) and State Street (4.0%), who are reluctant to back an activist without the cover of an ISS or Glass Lewis recommendation.

The pharmacy space is notoriously complex and competitive in the U.S., and Amazon Pharmacy is built in part on PillPack’s infrastructure, including its pharmacy software, fulfillment centers and relationships with health plans.', 'Amazon Pharmacy, announced Tuesday, is the company’s biggest push yet into $300 billion market, and threatens the dominance of traditional pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens, as well as other large retailers that offer pharmacy services, including Walmart.', 'Pharmacy stocks tumbled following the launch of Amazon Pharmacy. CVS shares fell 8.6% on Tuesday. Walgreens Boots Alliance dropped 9.6%. Shares of Rite Aid slid 16.2%. GoodRx, which helps consumers find discounts on prescription drugs, fell 22.5%. Amazon shares closed slightly higher.', 'For Amazon, the announcement is well timed. Americans are increasingly relying on getting their medicines via mail to avoid possible exposure to the coronavirus. That shift could be permanent, as more people than ever before are learning about new ways of receiving medication.', '“We wanted to make it easy for people to get their medication, understand the cost and get it delivered to the home,” said TJ Parker, Amazon’s vice president of pharmacy, who previously co-founded PillPack. “The hard work is to make it easy ... there were a number of complications behind the scenes.”', '“We think this new benefit will add tremendous value to our members,” added Jamil Ghani, vice president of Amazon Prime. “It’s relevant as folks try to do more from the comfort and safety of their homes.”', 'Customers over the age of 18 will have access to the pharmacy service this week in 45 states, not including Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana and Minnesota. Amazon expects to serve those states over time.', 'Amazon Pharmacy will accept most forms of insurance, but could offer savings for people without insurance as well. Customers can also use flexible spending accounts or health savings accounts to buy prescriptions on the service.', 'Before customers order medication for the first time, the site might ask them questions such as whether they’re pregnant, their date of birth and their gender as it was assigned at birth. That information is required by law to provide pharmacy care, and it helps pharmacists to do things like confirm prescriptions.', 'Doctors can send prescriptions directly to Amazon Pharmacy, or patients can request a transfer from an existing retailer, like CVS or Walgreens. Amazon says it has tools to verify that a physician legitimately ordered each prescription, and to tamp down on potential fraud.', 'Amazon Prime customers get free two-day delivery, although shipping might take up to five days the first time a customer orders, as it takes time to transfer a medication. Customers who don’t have Prime can get free delivery within five days, or they can pay $5.99 to upgrade to two-day delivery.', 'The medicines on offer include a mix of generic and brand-name drugs. Customers can get access to birth control, as well as commonly prescribed drugs like insulin, triamcinolone steroid creams, metformin for controlling blood sugar and sumatriptan for migraines.', 'Amazon will not deliver Schedule II controlled medications, including most opioids, and it won’t be replacing the Health & Personal Care store by offering vitamins and supplements.', 'Customers who have questions about their medications can reach a pharmacist or pharmacy technician at any time through online self-service or phone. Amazon will also screen for potentially problematic drug interactions for customers who are taking multiple medications at once.', 'Amazon’s Parker said that the storage and collection of customer health information is in compliance with federal HIPAA rules, and the company won’t share pharmacy data with advertisers or marketers without permission.', 'Amazon has leveraged its rich troves of customer data to build advertising into a key pillar of its overall business, and shows customers personalized ads and offers discounts based on what they have bought in the past. But consumers are likely to have a different set of expectations when they’re placing a prescription order versus browsing for a new pair of pants.', '“The information and experience you have inside the pharmacy is separate and distinct from the experience that you have on Amazon.com,” Parker said.', 'PillPack will continue to serve customers even after Amazon Pharmacy launches. That’s because PillPack is designed for a different use-case: It delivers medicines on a 30-day schedule to a population of patients that tend to be sicker and older than average, and often require multiple prescriptions.', 'Amazon Prime members have access to an additional pharmacy perk called the “prescription savings benefit,” which offers a discount of up to 80% on generic medications and up to 40% on brand-name prescriptions.', 'Amazon negotiated those discounts through a relationship with the Inside Rx savings program, which is part of Evernorth, a company that grew out of a merger between Express Scripts and insurance giant Cigna in 2018. Insurers use pharmacy benefits managers like Evernorth to negotiate drug rebates from drug manufacturers in exchange for better coverage.', 'Even for people who have health coverage, the Prime price might still end up being more affordable than the copay -- Amazon’s Parker said it happens “more frequently than people think” (although it won’t count toward a deductible).', 'Prime customers can also get a prescription savings benefit card to use at up to 50,000 pharmacies, including CVS, Walmart, Rite Aid and Walgreens. This might be preferable for customers who have an urgent need for medication and can’t wait two days for delivery.', 'Amazon’s Parker said the company does not currently have any brick-and-mortar pharmacies, and declined to speculate on its plans. But in future, the company could add pharmacies to Whole Foods and its chain of Amazon Fresh stores.', 'Correction: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of the Inside Rx savings program.']"

89,An $11 trillion global hydrogen energy boom is coming. Here’s what could trigger it,2020-11-01T14:52:28+0000,"['Some 130 miles south of Salt Lake City, engineers are working on what will become a giant cavity in the ground. It’s a geological formation known as a salt dome, a column of salt surrounded by sedimentary layers, and when it’s filled with hydrogen, it could become one of the largest renewable energy reservoirs in the world.', 'The historic wildfires that devastated California this year have highlighted concerns about climate change and how to make our society sustainable. The state aims to source all its power needs from clean, renewable energy by 2045, and Gov. Gavin Newsom recently said sales of new gas-powered passenger cars and trucks will end by 2035. Under a roadmap approved by the state regulator, California will need nearly 25 gigawatts in new renewable capacity, including some 8,900 megawatts of storage, by 2030. The Utah project could help meet those targets.    ', 'The Advanced Clean Energy Storage (ACES) project aims to build a storage facility for 1,000 megawatts of clean power, partly by putting hydrogen into underground salt caverns. Last year, Mitsubishi Power, a maker of gas turbines, and Magnum Development, which owns salt caverns for liquid fuel storage, announced the project will combine technologies such as renewable hydrogen, solid-oxide fuel cells, and compressed air energy storage. The storage facility would initially have enough energy to power 150,000 households for one year. Scheduled to be operational by 2025, the first phase of the Advanced Clean Energy Storage project will provide 150,000 MWh of renewable power storage capacity, nearly 150 times the current U.S. installed lithium-ion battery storage base, according to Mitsubishi Power.', 'The project will also help address a problem with renewable energy production: fossil-based energy must be used immediately because grids lack storage capacity, which can mean curtailment of renewables in times of low demand. Having large-scale renewable energy reserves on tap can accelerate the shift to clean power. If former Vice President Joe Biden is elected president next month, he may funnel up to $1.7 trillion over 10 years into measures to boost renewables and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles.', 'Green hydrogen is hydrogen produced with renewable power and zero emissions. With the cost of renewables like solar power falling, green hydrogen is being touted as one part of the energy mix that will lead toward decarbonization, with applications ranging from consumer and industrial power supplies to transportation and spaceflight. By 2050, U.S. demand for hydrogen could jump to 22 million to 41 million metric tons per year, up from 10 million today, according to a study released this month by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory.', 'After decades of false starts, hydrogen technology is poised to take off as falling production costs, technological improvements, and a global push toward sustainability converge, according to Bank of America. The firm believes this will generate $2.5 trillion in direct revenue — or $4 trillion if revenue from associated products such as fuel cell vehicles is counted — with the total market potential reaching $11 trillion by 2050.', 'Major firms such as BP, Siemens Energy, Shell and Air Liquide are interested in green hydrogen production, but part of the challenge is where to store energy so it can be ready when needed. That’s where a project like Advanced Clean Energy Storage can help.', '“California curtailed between 150,000-300,000 MWh of excess renewable energy per month through the spring of 2020, yet saw its first rolling blackouts in August because the grid was short on energy,” says Paul Browning, CEO of Mitsubishi Power Americas. “Long-duration energy storage projects like ours that are designed to shift excess energy from periods of oversupply, like California in the spring, to periods of undersupply, like California in late summer, are critical to ensure similar events are avoided as we continue to make significant strides towards deep decarbonization.”', 'Storing fuel in salt caverns isn’t new, but hydrogen’s growing role in decarbonization has revitalized interest in the concept. The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve has long stored emergency crude oil in underground salt caverns on the Gulf Coast, and notes they cost 10 times less than aboveground tanks and 20 times less than hard rock mines. The Reserve has 60 enormous caverns, typically 200 feet in diameter and 2,500 feet tall, and one “large enough for Chicago’s Willis Tower to fit inside with room to spare.”', 'Caverns can be created in salt domes by drilling into the salt dome and injecting the rock with water, which dissolves the salt. The resulting brine is extracted, leaving a large cavity. The next step is storing hydrogen in the cavern. Hydrogen electrolyzers can convert water into hydrogen by using renewable energy from solar and other sources. The hydrogen can then be stored, and reconverted to electricity when needed.', 'In the Advanced Clean Energy Storage project, some will power the adjacent Intermountain Power Project, a coal-fired plant operated by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power that will be converted to hydrogen and natural gas, which produces almost half the carbon dioxide of coal, by 2025. It’s scheduled to be all green hydrogen by 2045. If the initial phase of the project is successful, the salt dome’s vast capacity could be exploited further.', '“The formation has the potential to create up to 100 caverns, each one capable of holding 150,000 MWh of energy,” says Browning. “It would take 40,000 shipping containers of batteries to store that much energy in each cavern.”  ', 'Despite their storage potential, low operating cost and the fact that underground salt distribution is well known, only a handful of salt caverns have been created to store hydrogen. However, the concept is quickly gaining momentum in Europe, where the European Commission sees the share of hydrogen in Europe’s energy mix rising from under 2% as of 2019 to 13-14% by 2050.', 'Funded by the German government, the HYPOS alliance of over 100 companies and institutions aims to build a salt cavern in the Central German Chemical Triangle in Saxony-Anhalt with about 150,000 MWh of energy from wind power-generated hydrogen. Regulators are now reviewing the plans and when filling begins in 2023 or 2024, it could be continental Europe’s first hydrogen storage cavern, according to Stefan Bergander, a HYPOS project manager. Meanwhile, French gas utility Teréga and Hydrogène de France have agreed to launch the HyGéo pilot project in a disused salt cavern in southwestern France’s Nouvelle-Aquitaine region; it will store about 1.5 GWh of energy, enough for 400 households for a year.', '“Underground storage, in salt caverns or in porous media (i.e., in aquifers or in depleted oil and gas fields) is the only way to cope with big storage capacities,” says Louis Londe, technical director at Geostock, a French company specializing in underground storage. “Many hydrogen cavern projects for energy storage are blooming in Europe. At present, they are at the design stage. Not surprisingly, the leading countries are those where salt is the most present: Germany, U.K., Ireland, France, Netherlands.”', 'Europe has enough salt formations on and offshore to theoretically store about 85 petawatt hours of hydrogen power, according to a study published this year in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. The figure is hypothetical, and doesn’t take economics into account, but for example, 1 PWh of hydrogen is enough to supply today’s electricity demand in Germany for an entire year, says Dilara Gulcin Caglayan, lead author of the study and a scientist at the German research center Forschungszentrum Jülich’s Institute of Energy and Climate Research.', '“Our calculations show that without implementation of hydrogen salt caverns, there’s no cost-optimal pathway to achieve our climate goals,” says the institute’s deputy director Martin Robinius, a coauthor of the study. “By 2040, we will need a lot of hydrogen salt caverns, but if we don’t start building them now, we won’t be able to build them to scale to meet those goals.”', 'As part of its goal to be climate-neutral by 2050, the European Commission recently produced a hydrogen roadmap saying rapid, large-scale deployment of clean hydrogen is key for the European Union to lower greenhouse gas emissions by at least half by 2030, adding that “Investment in hydrogen will foster sustainable growth and jobs, which will be critical in the context of recovery from the COVID-19 crisis.”', '“The issue of storage is, of course, key to delivering energy transition and in this respect hydrogen and hydrogen technologies have a critical role to play,” says Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, secretary general of Hydrogen Europe, an alliance of about 250 companies and research organizations that has called for Covid-19 recovery investment of €55 billion ($65 billion) in salt cavern storage to 2030 to build hydrogen capacity of 3 million metric tons. “Large scale hydrogen storage facilities, mainly salt caverns and possibly some empty gas fields, need to be part of hydrogen infrastructure.”']"

', 'He declined to say whether Surface or Windows is more important to him than the other, but Windows licenses still generate considerably more revenue for Microsoft than Surface computers. Morgan Stanley estimated that Microsoft will generate $13.3 billion in Windows OEM revenue and $6.5 billion in Surface revenue in the 2021 fiscal year.', 'But the partners that license Windows haven’t always supported Microsoft’s moves to step on their turf with its own tablets and laptops. The CEO of Acer told the Financial Times Microsoft should “think twice” when it first introduced its Surface tablet in 2012. And Asus reportedly felt blindsided when Panay unveiled the Surface Book -- which was more like a traditional laptop computer -- in 2015.', 'When Panay speaks at Microsoft events about the latest Surface computers, he almost unnaturally enthusiastic and oddly specific about hardware components.

What do you want to accomplish? You can pick a device that suits you.”', 'In 2016, Microsoft announced a partnership with Lenovo, the world’s biggest seller of PCs, in an effort to prevent conflicts that might arise between the Surface business and Windows.', '“We came to a very simple approach...we call it a level playing field,” said Lenovo’s leader of worldwide strategic alliances, Christian Eigen, who has known Panay for 15 years. “It means Microsoft does not give, from an operating system point of view, any feature exclusively to Surface.”', 'The CEOs of Microsoft and Lenovo communicate four to six times per year, and teams lower down in the organizations talk 12 to 24 times per year, Eigen explained.', 'Microsoft also improved its communications with partners around Windows 11.', '“It was definitely, by far, more transparent and open and kind of cooperative development,” Eigen said.

That may not be enough to get people to ditch Windows 10 computers.', '“I don’t think they’re going to sell particularly well out of the gate,” Michael Cherry, senior analyst at Directions on Microsoft, said of the new Windows 11 PCs. Early adopters might buy them at first, but people won’t all suddenly have new computers running Windows 10, because of the chip shortage, Cherry said.', 'The PC market enjoyed a 13% year-over-year increase in unit shipments in 2020, the fastest growth in a decade, according to estimates from market research company IDC. And many of the computers people bought last year can upgrade to Windows 11 for free. The buying frenzy might not continue for much longer, even as many people continue remote work. While IDC forecasts 14% growth for 2021, it sees shipments rising less than 2% in 2022.', 'But Panos argued some Surface features are more compelling to customers now.', '″‘Why do you put cameras and microphones on your Surface?’ I’d be asked that question,” Panay said. “Can you imagine trying to ask that question today?” Now cameras and microphones enable people to meet virtually through their computers with coworkers, classmates and family members.', 'A new look for Windows counts for something, too. New Windows versions make a difference in people’s willingness to spend their money, Burd said.', 'Eigen, at Lenovo, said he’s hoping Windows 11 will accelerate the cycle of people replacing PCs. Young people might want to graduate from just owning smartphones, while older people might want to upgrade because the PC is easier to use with Windows 11, he said.', 'Panay’s optimistic. He said Windows 11 will end up being more popular than Windows 10, which exceeded 1.3 billion monthly active devices. He did not say when that would happen.

Apple’s Mac sales have continued to grow through the pandemic and were up 70% year over year in its fiscal Q2 as people worked, learned and played at home. That growth may slow as people continue to get vaccinated and head back to our commutes (and our clunky work-issued computers), but the iMac is so nice it may help push Mac sales for people who still need a computer at home.', 'Here’s what you need to know about it.', 'The iMac is just crazy, crazy thin. It’s sort of like a giant iPad with a big bottom chin sitting on a metal stand. It’s also surprisingly light, which means you can easily move it from room to room if you need to, so long as there’s an outlet nearby.', 'I love the variety of colors. Apple sent me the blue model, which has a deeper hue on the back than the sort of sky blue below the display on the front. It really looks and feels as if Apple is trying to make this the Mac that people show off around their house again, and I think some people actually will.', 'The screen is another highlight. It’s now 24 inches diagonally, a notable improvement from the 21.5-inch display on the model it replaces. It’s also nice and sharp with a 4.5K resolution and support for HDR content, which more clearly shows the deep darks and bright parts of a movie or TV show. I used the iMac as a computer in my office and also as a TV in my bedroom. I liked that the screen was big enough that I could watch stuff from bed as I would on a TV.', 'The iMac is fast and all the apps I use for work and play are supported. Most people who are casually editing photos and videos will find there’s enough power. Pros who want to edit and render video, however, will naturally gravitate toward Apple’s Pro machines, since there isn’t a big beefy graphics card in here. The same goes for games — you’re fine playing games that are a few years old, or any of the popular iPad or iPhone games that run on M1, like everything in Apple Arcade. But don’t expect to play something like Call of Duty: Warzone.', 'The speakers are also surprisingly good for how thin it is. I normally use a pair of $50 speakers on my desktop PC and this blows them away. There’s also a headphone jack in case you ever want to add a different set of speakers, or you can always use Bluetooth to pair up with a headset or AirPods.', 'There are two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports on the back of the entry-level $1,299 model, and the $1,499 version I tested has an additional two USB 3 ports (this is true for all more expensive models, too). That was enough for me to drop a few cables on the back for charging my iPhone, AirPods and more at my desk, while also using one of the Thunderbolt ports to add a second display. If you want to avoid dongles, consider getting the model with the additional ports. Speaking of ports, the charger uses a magnet, though it’s not branded MagSafe like the older MacBook and current iPhone 12 chargers. It’s just a power port that’s a bit safer since it’ll pop out if you trip on the cable.', 'The new Magic Keyboard, which matches the color of the computer you buy (as does the mouse) can be configured with a Touch ID fingerprint sensor for $50 more. You should do that while buying the iMac. It’s really convenient for making purchases (like you would on Apple’s laptops), for logging in in a split second, or for sharing a computer. Each family member just registers their fingerprints and then they can tap it to log in to their account when they jump on the computer.', 'Finally, the camera quality is noticeably better. Apple’s M1 chip offers better quality even compared with the 27-inch iMac it launched last summer, which uses the same camera hardware. It did a good job keeping my image clear and bright, even if the room was a little dark. But I’d love to see Apple add some of the smart tracking so that the camera could follow me around the room — if I’m pacing while talking to my editor over FaceTime. It’s a feature Apple introduced in the new iPad Pros this year, so maybe that will make its way over in future models.', 'All of this comes together to form a really capable desktop computer for the price. But there are still a few things I think could be improved.', 'The thing that stands out to me most here is the lack of a touchscreen. Apple has said Macs serve one purpose and iPads serve another. But I think a touchscreen would work well here. If you’re flipping through recipes, for example, you might want to touch the screen instead of using a mouse. Also, the iMac’s M1 chip lets you run iPhone and iPad apps if they’re supported by the developer. A lot of the ones you might want, like Netflix and YouTube TV (or any of Google’s apps for that matter) aren’t there. But many are designed to be used with touch. ', 'Maybe I’m crazy, but I’d love to see an option in macOS that lets you flip to the iPadOS for when you want to use it like a touchscreen, and then switch back to regular macOS when you don’t. Imagine just walking up and tapping Netflix and tapping a TV show. (I’d like to see macOS on an iPad Pro, too.) I can dream.', 'It’s kind of a bummer it doesn’t have an older regular USB 2.0 port. I know it’s old technology, but there are still tons of chargers and accessories that use that type without an adapter, including the Apple Watch.', 'I also wish the display supported more angles. You can adjust the vertical angle by tilting it back or forward, but you can’t raise or lower the display or turn it left to right. It’s just locked onto the stand. Normally this works fine, but if you have a shorter desk or sit up higher on your chair, you might want to know you can’t really adjust it to match your height unless you prop it up on some books.', 'My guess is most people are going to use the iMac with just the built-in screen, since it’s pretty big. But the M1 chip only supports one additional monitor, the same as with the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini. So if you’re like me and normally use three separate displays, you’re going to be limited. I found I was able to get up to three screens by using an iPad Pro with the Side Car app, however. But you won’t get three big screens over HDMI or Thunderbolt.', 'Lastly, it has a big chin under the screen. It doesn’t bug me at all, but I think people who are used to big screens without much of a border might find it a turn-off. That’s just a personal preference thing.', 'The new iMac is a fantastic desktop computer and worth buying if you need a desktop computer for you or the family. It will make a great home school computer for your kids, or an office desktop. ', 'But I also think you should consider buying a MacBook Air, my current favorite computer on the market given its power, battery life and price. Then, you can add a big screen at your desk, like this $400 one from LG, or something more expensive like this from Dell, and just plug the Air in when you want a big, bright display.', 'The catch is that a quality 4K display with the colors, brightness and accuracy of the iMac is going to set you back several hundred dollars or more. You’ll also miss out on the good built-in speakers, added ports and webcam. But you gain portability, since you can take your MacBook Air everywhere you go.', 'It’s a toss-up, but worth considering both options if you’re shopping for a new computer now.', 'Overall, I think Apple has a winner here with an all-around solid computer that checks most boxes for most people. I can’t help but wonder how many of these Apple would have sold if it launched at the beginning of the pandemic.', 'Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube. ']"

The halts were attributed to a global semiconductor shortage, which has posed a challenge to Tesla all year, and plagued the entire auto industry.', 'New battery electric models, notably Rivian’s R1T and Lucid Motors’ long-delayed luxury Lucid Air sedan, are now in production and selling to customers in the U.S., an indication that competition is heating up in key markets for Tesla.', 'At the same time, interest in electric vehicles is rising too, even in the U.S., a laggard in adoption compared to China and Europe.', 'According to a June 2021 survey from Pew Research, 39% of Americans say that “the next time they purchase a vehicle, they are at least somewhat likely to seriously consider electric.” About 7% of Americans said they have already purchased a pure battery electric or hybrid-electric vehicle.', 'That demand is only encouraged by rising fuel costs and environmental regulations.', 'For example, in China, government programs make it far quicker and cheaper to get license plates for electric vehicles than internal combustion engine vehicles. The Chinese government has also offered subsidies, tax breaks and invested in charging infrastructure to encourage EV production and adoption.', 'Meanwhile, President Joe Biden set a voluntary target for half of all new vehicle sales in the US to be electric models by 2030 — including battery electrics, plug-in hybrids, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The move is part of the Biden administration’s pledge to reduce U.S. emissions by in half by 2030.', 'Piper Sandler senior research analyst Alexander Potter, a bull with a $1,200 price target for shares of Tesla, wrote in a note on September 27:', '“Tesla’s share of the battery electric vehicle (BEV) market will almost certainly fall – because many peers haven’t started selling BEVs yet. But we fully expect Tesla’s share of the overall market to continue rising, and we stress that declining BEV market share should not be considered a bearish signal... After all, Tesla is competing against vehicles of all types – not just against other electric vehicles.”', 'Auto Forecast Solutions Vice President Sam Fiorani agreed. He said, “Tesla has such a head start on the competition in the EV market that it is unlikely for anyone to pass them anytime soon. The Cult of Tesla will keep buyers attached to the brand for years to come. Even Audi and Mercedes are finding it difficult to tap into the same type of aura.

The mission, called Demo-2, is technically the final test flight of the company’s spacecraft. Regardless of the nature of the mission, Demo-2 will be the first launch of NASA astronauts from the U.S. since 2011.', '“This is a new generation, a new era in spaceflight,” NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said.', 'See CNBC’s live blog for up-to-the-minute coverage, and watch the launch live here.', 'Ever since the space shuttle retired nearly a decade ago, the U.S. has paid Russia upwards of $80 million per seat to fly NASA astronauts to the International Space Station. But NASA awarded SpaceX and Boeing with contracts worth $3.1 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, to develop new spacecraft under a program called Commercial Crew. For SpaceX, the Demo-2 launch represents the final flight test of its Crew Dragon capsule, built to carry as many as seven people to orbit.', '“We need to have the capability of accessing space — not just for NASA, but for all of humanity,” Bridenstine said.', 'The historic importance of Demo-2 is drawing a wide audience, from Wall Street to Silicon Valley to the nation’s capital. VIPs scheduled to attend at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center include President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. SpaceX founder and CEO Musk  plans to watch from within the Mission Control room just a few miles from the launch site.', 'Morgan Stanley is telling investors to pay attention to Demo-2 because of what it means for the future of private spaceflight and the many companies working on technologies to support futures missions. ', '“Mark May 27th on your calendars. You don’t want to miss this,” Morgan Stanley said.', 'One of the key factors for launching remains the temperamental Florida weather. NASA and SpaceX continue to move forward with the launch as planned, with liftoff set for 4:33 p.m. ET Wednesday. As of Monday, the Air Force’s 45th Space Wing forecast that the launch has a 40% probability, given current weather concerns, which include rain and thick clouds. If NASA and SpaceX decide to postpone the launch, the mission has back-up times set for Saturday at 3:22 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m.', 'While thousands of people have come to Florida’s Space Coast to watch NASA launch crew, the agency made an unprecedented request given the coronavirus crisis. The head of NASA said “now is not the time” for large crowds to gather on the highways and beaches to watch the launch. ', '“Join us in this launch but do so from home. We are asking people not to travel to the Kennedy Space Center,” Bridenstine said.', 'NASA will broadcast 24 hours of nonstop live coverage of SpaceX Demo-2. The webcast will begin four hours before liftoff and continues until the spacecraft docks with the International Space Station the next day.', 'Here is what you need to know about SpaceX’s first astronaut launch.', 'Crew Dragon is the name of the SpaceX capsule that will carry NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley. It’s an evolved version of the company’s Cargo Dragon spacecraft, which has launched to-and-from the space station 20 times. Just as Cargo Dragon was the first privately developed spacecraft to bring supplies to the ISS, so Crew Dragon will be the first privately developed spacecraft to bring people. ', '“The investments that we have made into SpaceX and the investment SpaceX has made in itself have really resulted in something that is going to be very beneficial — not just for human space exploration, but beneficial for the economy,” Bridenstine said. ', 'Likewise, SpaceX President and COO Gwynne Shotwell told reporters that “NASA has been an extraordinary customer and extraordinary partner” for the company. While Shotwell didn’t know specifically how much SpaceX had spent of its own funds to develop Crew Dragon, she noted that “SpaceX invests heavily in our products.” Last year, Musk said SpaceX had invested on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars to fund Crew Dragon development.', 'NASA also expects that in addition to getting a way to send astronauts to space, it will be getting a cost-saving option as well. The agency expects to pay $55 million per astronaut to fly with Crew Dragon, as opposed to $86 million per astronaut to fly with the Russians.', '“We together have become stronger in engineering technical support for this nation,” NASA Commercial Crew program manager Kathy Lueders said.', 'Crew Dragon with its trunk stands just under 27 feet tall and 13 feet around. The spacecraft includes its own system of small rocket engines for directional control in space and a launch abort system in the event of an emergency. Its trunk is the large lower half that’s covered in solar panels, which can carry cargo.', 'The spacecraft is designed to carry seven people. It has a system of controls that is focused around touch screens, although NASA notes that Crew Dragon has a “robust fault tolerance built into the system.” As the astronauts will be wearing custom SpaceX spacesuits, the touch screens work whether or not the astronauts are wearing gloves. The spacesuits are largely designed to protect the astronauts in the event that the spacecraft loses pressurization, with life support and power systems connected through a point on the spacesuit’s leg.', 'Additionally, the astronauts are expected to have to manually control the spacecraft only for a short period. Even the very careful docking process when Crew Dragon reaches the ISS is expected to be done autonomously.', 'SpaceX’s Falcon 9 is the workhorse of the company’s growing fleet of rockets. It stands at nearly 230 feet tall and is capable of launching as much as 25 tons to low Earth orbit. ', 'Crew Dragon will sit in place of the rocket’s nose cone at the top. After launching the spacecraft on its way, the large lower portion of Falcon 9, known as the “booster,” will reenter the Earth’s atmosphere and attempt to land on the company’s drone ship in the ocean. SpaceX has landed its Falcon 9 rocket boosters 44 times.', 'Behnken, 49, and Hurley, 53, have been astronauts since being selected in NASA’s class of 2000. Each flew on two space shuttle missions, with Hurley notably flying on that spacecraft’s last mission in July 2011. Both are military veterans: Behnken served in the Air Force and Hurley in the Marine Corps.', 'For Demo-2, Behnken is the joint operations commander, which means he is responsible for tasks such as reaching the ISS and docking. Hurley is the spacecraft commander and will be responsible for Crew Dragon’s launch, landing and recovery.', 'The pair officially entered a preflight quarantine on May 13, although the astronauts said they’ve been self-isolating since mid-March. While astronauts typically enter a quarantine ahead of a mission, the protocol has been additionally strict for Demo-2 due to the coronavirus. NASA commercial spaceflight director Phil McAlister said earlier this month that “direct interaction with the crew is not permitted without appropriate protective gear.” Even interaction with VIPs the day before launch will be through a glass wall.', 'SpaceX has also taken extra precautions. Shotwell said that in the last two months, the company has been “ensuring that only essential personnel” were going near astronauts during training. SpaceX employees “are wearing masks and gloves,” she added.', '“We are social distancing as well. We’ve got at least half our engineering staff working from home,” Shotwell said.', 'Even the Mission Control room will look different than in years past, NASA said. The agency will use different rooms to keep people safely distant from each other, with NASA looking to add plexiglass between seats and stations for Demo-2.', 'Four hours before liftoff, Behnken and Hurley will suit up. About a half an hour later, the crew will walk out to their Tesla Model X, complete with NASA logos, and drive from the astronaut quarters out to the launchpad.', 'With 2½ hours to go, the astronauts will strap into their seats in Crew Dragon and begin checking that all systems are good to go. Then, with just under two hours until launch, the hatch to the spacecraft will be closed. ', 'SpaceX will begin loading the rocket with fuel 35 minutes before launch, which will initiate a final series of processes and checks.', '“We’ve worked closely with NASA since 2006 and all that work is culminating to this historic event,” Shotwell said. “My heart is sitting right here [in my throat], and I think it’s going to stay there until we get Bob and Doug safely back from the International Space Station.”  ', 'A few minutes after liftoff, the Falcon 9′s booster stage will return and attempt to land on the company’s barge stationed in the Atlantic Ocean.', 'If anything were to go wrong in the last half hour before the launch and even during the launch, Crew Dragon will abort and fire its emergency escape system. The company performed a full test of that system in January with no one inside the spacecraft. That test saw SpaceX trigger the system during the most intense part of the launch to show that it could be done at any time.', 'The Demo-2 mission has only just begun after Crew Dragon reaches orbit. As the final flight test for SpaceX’s capsule, NASA said Demo-2 “will validate the company’s crew transportation system, including the launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, and operational capabilities.”', 'Docking with the ISS will be a critical part of the mission. Although expected to be done autonomously, the docking and undocking process is essentially a high-speed dance in orbit, as both the ISS and Crew Dragon will be moving at tens of thousands of miles per hour. SpaceX created a virtual simulator of the docking process, so that viewers can try their hand at manually docking Crew Dragon. Notably, the virtual simulator use the actual interface that Behnken and Hurley would use when piloting the spacecraft.', 'Once Crew Dragon docks, Behnken and Hurley will become part of the crew on the ISS. In addition to performing test on Crew Dragon, the astronauts will join the rest of the ISS crew in conducting research and other tasks.', 'NASA is not sure how long the Demo-2 mission will last. McAlister said the mission has “an unbelievably complicated set of criteria and considerations” for its duration, which is currently set for between 30 to 119 days. The Crew Dragon spacecraft for future missions will be capable of staying in space for at least 210 days.', 'After undocking, Behnken and Hurley will point Crew Dragon back toward Earth. The capsule will reenter the Earth’s atmosphere and then use its parachutes to slow and splash down in the Atlantic. The astronauts will then be picked up at sea by SpaceX’s ship “GO Navigator” and then return to Florida’s Space Coast.', 'Demo-2 represents the final step before NASA certifies the SpaceX capsule to fly regular, long missions to the ISS. After those missions begin, SpaceX plans to use Crew Dragon spacecraft for other missions. Those include space tourism, as the company has so far unveiled two deals to fly privately paying people to space on Crew Dragon as early as next year.', 'Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.']"
101,Trump administration paying huge premium for mask-cleaning machines. Which don’t do the job.,2020-05-20T17:54:47+0000,"['It sounded like a great deal: The White House coronavirus task force would buy a defense company’s new cleaning machines to allow critical protective masks to be reused up to 20 times. And at $60 million for 60 machines on April 3, the price was right.', 'But over just a few days, the potential cost to taxpayers exploded to $413 million, according to notes of a coronavirus task force meeting obtained by NBC News. By May 1, the Pentagon pegged the ceiling at $600 million in a justification for awarding the deal without an open bidding process or an actual contract. Even worse, scientists and nurses say the recycled masks treated by these machines begin to degrade after two or three treatments, not 20, and the company says its own recent field testing has only confirmed the integrity of the masks for four cycles of use and decontamination.', 'Nurses in several places across the country now say they are afraid of being at greater risk of acquiring Covid-19 while using N95 masks, which they say often don’t fit correctly after just a few spins through a cleaning system that uses vapor phase hydrogen peroxide to disinfect them.', 'The nurses, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution from their employers or the government, said they believe the machines, which are made by the Battelle Memorial Institute and have been promoted by President Donald Trump, were rushed into service as a shortcut to acquiring and manufacturing protective equipment.', '“It’s a fairy tale,” said one nurse in Connecticut who works at a hospital where masks are run through the Battelle decontamination system. “It’s being done because we don’t have the policies in place to do what needs to be done, and people are going to be hurt because of it.”', 'As Trump has pushed to find silver-bullet solutions to the pandemic during an election year, the speedy decision to activate the machines reflects yet again the problematic decision-making of the White House task force. As a series of NBC News articles have shown, its leaders have looked past financial costs, potential harm to the public and the risk of getting ghosted by bidders in order to give Trump a steady stream of deals to announce, often with major companies.', '“They’re always swinging for the fences hoping that one time they’ll hit a grand slam” and not worrying if they strike out, said one administration official familiar with the work of the task force. “They’re gambling that they’ll win one time, and if they don’t they’ll just deflect, which is what we see inside all the time.”', 'In weeks of interviews, email exchanges and text messages over the last month with scores of people involved at all levels of the coronavirus response — senior White House officials to front-line responders, career federal officials to scientists working in the field, corporate CEOs to front-line responders — a picture of the task force’s methods has come into ever-sharper focus. Working without external oversight, it has pumped billions of dollars into hard-to-trace contracts for Covid-19 supplies that often don’t pan out as advertised.', 'White House officials have said often that the president is doing everything he can to protect the nation from the twin emergencies of the disease and its effect on the economy, and Trump and his lieutenants have routinely justified waiving safety and contracting rules by pointing to the need to speed supplies to the front lines of the fight. But critics say Trump has prioritized political ends at the expense of sound science and contracting practices that are designed to protect the public.', '“They keep saying these recycled masks are still safe after all these cycles, but we don’t know that,” said a nurse in Pennsylvania, whose hospital has used Battelle’s system. “What we do know is that there are not enough masks for medical workers and there are very real consequences if we get sick.”', 'Battelle stands by its 2016 study of its technology, which used manikins rather than human subjects to determine whether masks lost their fit or were permeated by particles after 20 uses, according to company officials who responded to NBC News’ inquiries in an email. But the company also said it has only verified the purity of masks for four uses in field testing at Massachusetts General Hospital since the machines were built to respond to a pandemic. That puts health care workers in the position of being the first living experimental test subjects.', '“To date, Battelle has received and tested samples representative of four actual use cycles from MassGen,” Will Richter, Battelle’s principal research scientist, said. “The goal of this assessment is to determine the impact of actual wear.”', 'The pursuit of an all-of-the-above approach to finding medical solutions and equipment to slow the spread of the virus has perversely wasted time, money and opportunity, according to critics within the administration who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity because they fear losing their jobs.', 'But some lawmakers, former government officials and a handful of current administration officials have spoken publicly in ways that echo and amplify those concerns.', '“It’s just outrageous,” Chuck Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska who served as defense secretary under President Barack Obama, said in a telephone interview with NBC News. “Over the course of the last few weeks, what this administration has done, how they have done it with contracts and everything, there’s no transparency, there’s no accountability.”', 'Battelle’s sanitizers were mobilized by a task force designed to execute on Trump’s demands, despite reservations about safety and cost.', 'On March 29, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, slammed the Food and Drug Administration for limiting a waiver of safety regulations for Battelle, which is based in his state. DeWine had lobbied heavily for the waiver in the first place and was upset that the use of Battelle machines was going to be restricted.', 'At the time, Trump was highly sensitive to criticism from the nation’s governors, having said that week that they should be “appreciative” of the use of his power to help their states. DeWine went to bat for Battelle, which needed looser rules so that its machines could be deployed outside its main facility and used on more than 10,000 masks a day, according to the FDA and DeWine.', 'The upbraiding of the administration drew headlines, and DeWine said Trump promised him the ruling would be changed. The president even pressured the FDA on Twitter. The broader waiver lifting the limit was announced by the FDA within hours, and DeWine showed his appreciation by thanking Trump and FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn for intervening.', 'FDA spokesperson Brittney Manchester said that Battelle had originally asked for permission to decontaminate 10,000 masks per day at a single site and that the initial emergency waiver written March 28 covered that. The FDA revised the language after it “learned” the company wanted to use its machines “at an unlimited number of sites with no ceiling on the number of [masks] that may be decontaminated per day,” Manchester said.', 'Spokespeople for Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who chairs the task force, declined to answer any of NBC News’ questions about the waiver for Battelle, the federal contract and the safety of masks cleaned by the company’s machines. But with the newly revised waiver in hand, Battelle worked with the task force so it could sell its machines to the government.', 'Technically, the Defense Logistics Agency, an arm of the Pentagon working with the task force, gave Battelle a “contract letter,” which allows for details of a deal to be finalized after the work starts. When DLA officials submitted a legally required justification explaining the parameters of the deal this month, they wrote that the “maximum dollar value” is now $600 million.', 'The company says it might not hit the cap.', '“As demand ebbs and flows at various sites across the country, Battelle will adjust its staffing accordingly and will bill the government only the actual costs incurred,” company spokesperson Katy Delaney said. “If the contract costs are less than the ceiling cost, then the government will not spend up to the ceiling.”', 'DLA spokesman Patrick Mackin said the $187 million of extra room is there for flexibility.“To date, the value of the contract remains at $413M,” he said in an email. “The maximum value of the contract is $600M in the event we need to make any adjustments in the support provided by Battelle during the period of performance.”', 'The task force’s deployment of mask sanitizers, several other versions of which have been given an emergency greenlight since Battelle’s went into service, are now part of a transition to a focus on boosting the economy, because the administration insists they reduce the need to supply fresh masks to health care workers. The president himself has said workers have all the equipment they need.', 'On May 6, Trump told a group of nurses at the White House that reports of PPE shortages are “fake news,” and on May 14, he said he was winding down an airlift program that brought equipment into the U.S. from overseas “because we’re very stocked up.”', 'But that’s inconsistent with the experience of many front-line workers, according to Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, which represents the second-largest number of nurses of any union in the country.', 'There’s still a shortage of PPE, she said, which means that health care workers have little choice but to use masks sanitized by the Battelle machines even though “they really believe that N95s should be used once and that’s it.”', 'It’s “not ideal” she said of the sanitization. “Is it better than nothing? Yes.”', 'In fact, Weingarten asked top union officials to create a supply chain for personal protective equipment and kept the operation a secret for several weeks until the first batch of masks, face shields and other items began to arrive earlier this month. She said she feared that the shipments would be seized or rerouted by the administration.', 'When task force leaders convened at FEMA headquarters on April 8, they faced a conflict over whether to proceed with Battelle’s contract despite the sharp price spike.', 'Trump clearly wanted the mask sanitizers to be deployed rapidly. It had only been 10 days since he tweeted his support for the FDA waiver, which allowed masks cleaned by the machines to be used in health care facilities and freed the company from existing federal quality-assurance regulations.', 'But from April 3 to April 8, the price had skyrocketed from $60 million to $413 million. An Ohio-based nonprofit corporation that pays top executives more than $1 million a year and spent $350,000 lobbying Congress and federal agencies from Jan. 1 to March 30, Battelle raised the price for each machine from $1 million to $6.8 million “due to the inclusion of operating costs for six months, shipping, and logistics tails to be covered up front,” according to a summary of the decision-making meeting that was circulated to task force members and obtained by NBC News.', 'The “logistics tail,” a term the military uses to describe the chain of goods and people supporting combat troops in war, broadly refers to the costs of providing supplies and administrative support for a project. The additional $353 million over six months for the logistics tail, which includes the price of employing and training technicians, is equivalent to the retail value of 278 million new N95 masks.', 'In addition to operating the machines, maintaining them and shipping masks back and forth to health care systems, Delaney said “each site requires things like portable restrooms, showers, protective equipment and in some cases very large tents to house the operations.”', 'Battelle has performed countless billions of dollars worth of work for the federal government since its participation in the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. Much of its work is classified because the company manages eight nuclear labs for the Department of Energy. Battelle also offers private-sector customers in various industries a wide variety of services, including assisting with FDA approval for e-cigarettes. While it enjoys the tax exemptions of a nonprofit, it is a well-established player in the elite spheres of energy and defense contracting, and employs more than 27,000 people.', 'The company had a powerful customer in the president, and the seven-fold difference between the original estimate on April 3 and the price on April 8 appears to have bothered only one of the senior officials with a seat at the task force’s decision-making table, according to the summary of the debate.', 'That was Air Force Brig. Gen. John Bartrum, a consultant to the HHS department who oversees the agency’s financial resources, and he raised a formal objection to the task force’s board. He said the government should consider buying 10 of the machines and supporting operational costs for $80 million or $100 million. He advocated for taking time to re-evaluate whether it made sense to go in for the full load, according to the summary of the April 8 meeting.', 'His concern was consistent with those of a wide variety of federal experts on budgeting, contracting, epidemiology, disease testing, vaccine and drug-therapy development, and public health who have pushed higher-ups to step back and reconsider White House priorities — or at least take more care with taxpayers’ money.', 'For example, Dr. Rick Bright, who was the head of the federal agency in charge of developing vaccines, testified before Congress last Thursday after filing a whistleblower complaint alleging he was moved from his position in retaliation for objecting to the president’s insistence on purchasing hydroxychloroquine. The drug, which the White House pushed the task force to acquire in tens of millions of doses and which Trump said Monday he has been taking himself, has not been proven to treat Covid-19, and the FDA has issued warnings about its misuse.', 'But many experts’ voices are being drowned out by the task force’s rush to please a president whose response to the threat of coronavirus was slow and whose recommended remedies have included ingesting disinfectant.', 'Inside FEMA headquarters, Bartrum was met with resistance by the supply chain unit of the task force, which had recommended the deal in the first place, on the basis that the machines would allow front-line workers to use the same mask up to 20 times. The figure cited was based on Battelle’s study of its own product. The supply chain unit chief, John Polowczyk, has been known to brag that he has a “blank check” from the president and doesn’t care what his group has to spend to acquire goods, according to the person familiar with the task force’s work.', 'Polowczyk wasn’t present for the meeting, which included senior HHS department, Pentagon, FEMA and National Security Council officials, according to the minutes obtained by NBC News. Members of the president’s National Security Council staff joined the discussion by videoconference.', 'Bartrum was outgunned. The task force board — FEMA Director Pete Gaynor and HHS Department Assistant Secretaries Robert Kadlec and Brett Giroir — sided with Polowczyk’s team and ordered the purchase to move forward, according to the summary. (Kadlec also clashed with Bright over hydroxychloroquine.)', 'In a concession to Bartrum, the board said federal agencies should work with Battelle to see if there might be a way to deploy the machines in phases. Two days after the meeting, Battelle and the Defense Department announced the $413 million deal. Over the course of less than two weeks, Battelle had won the emergency waiver from the FDA, struck a deal with the task force, renegotiated that agreement to bring in nearly seven times as much money and released the news to the public.', 'In justifying the contracting decisions, which ended up raising the cap by another $187 million, Pentagon officials wrote that “under normal conditions, an acquisition with this level of complexity and dollar value would take approximately one year to complete under full and open competition procedures based upon Agency experience.”', 'If anyone on the task force questioned the company’s statement about the number of times its cleaning machine could treat masks for safe use was reasonable, it was not recorded in the summary of the meeting. Bartrum declined NBC News’ request for an interview through an agency spokesperson.', 'Retired Adm. Ken Carodine, who worked on logistics at the Pentagon, said in a telephone interview that defense-contracting officials frequently negotiate with companies that bid for work at one price and then jack up the total almost overnight.', '“The goal is to never leave,” he said of the practice defense companies use in raising prices to cover employing their workers on government projects for as long as possible. “If anybody should understand the cost of building personal protection equipment and understanding what the entire cost cycle looks like, it’s Battelle.”', 'Carodine lamented that Pentagon officials routinely refer to defense contract changes of hundreds of millions of dollars as “budget dust” and said that Trump removed a key safeguard with his recent firing of inspectors general who had the power to investigate aspects of the coronavirus response.', '“The last person who’s going to take a look is the inspector general,” he said.', 'Five days after the deal became public, an NIH-led study concluded that the hydrogen peroxide vapor method of decontamination is only safe for three cycles.', 'The study, conducted out by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is run by Dr. Anthony Fauci, used different methods than Battelle’s, according to Dr. Seth Judson, a University of Washington internal medicine resident who worked on the evaluation. The NIH version employed special technology to measure exposure of the virus inside masks and tried to replicate how they would maintain their fit on real people, as opposed to the manikins used in Battelle’s study.', '“Since the exposure and testing procedures are different, it is difficult to compare the results, but I think the quantitative testing on people reflects a closer to ‘real world’ situation,” Judson said in an email to NBC News. “Health care workers such as myself may wear these masks for long periods of time, and degradation is seen as masks are repeatedly donned and doffed.”', 'Battelle agrees that its 2016 study, which did not convince the FDA to approve its technology for commercial use until the president stepped in, didn’t use the same methodology as the NIH version.', '“The 2016 study simply reports visual inspections of masks,” Richter, the company scientist, said. “Filtration studies are performed using a TSI 8130A, the industry standard for aerosol performance evaluation. … Testing continues to build a data bank on different makes and models” of masks.', 'After that study was published, Battelle said, it won approval for a real-world test of its technology.', '“The overall conclusion from this study was that three cycles of decontamination did not adversely impact the fit performance,” the company said.', 'Battelle’s system is already in use by over 400 hospitals across California alone, according to state records, and several other companies have won FDA waivers to deploy mask-sanitizing machines since Battelle was granted its exemption.', 'Front-line health care workers in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Idaho and Virginia who have used masks decontaminated by the Battelle system told NBC News they are concerned about their own safety.', '“We are worried about how effective our masks are and if we’ll end up catching Covid,” said one Virginia nurse, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. More “young healthy health care workers are getting it than the general population because we are exposed to a higher viral load.”']"

', 'Scott Hilton, a longtime colleague of Marc Lore’s and former chief revenue officer of Walmart’s e-commerce business, is Wonder’s chief executive, a person familiar with the investment said. Chad Lore also holds a top role, while Marc is serving in an advisory capacity, said the person, who requested anonymity since the business is still in an early stage. ', 'Marc Lore, 49, is most known for creating innovative e-commerce businesses and selling them to corporate giants like Amazon and Walmart.', 'He helped found Quidsi, the parent of Diapers.com, and sold it to Amazon for $545 million in 2010. Six years later, Walmart paid $3 billion to acquire his next venture, Jet.com. Lore stayed on for four years, helping Walmart by overseeing its e-commerce division and accelerating the big-box retailer’s growth.', 'On its app, Wonder pitches itself as a “new home dining experience with a kitchen that comes to you.” ', 'It is being piloted in the northern part of Westfield, an affluent suburb that is home to many New York City transplants. Residents often move to the close-knit town in order to trade a cramped apartment for a spacious home to raise a family. Yet it’s likely that these families haven’t lost their craving for the fine dining options that are a convenient perk of city life. ', 'That’s the need Wonder is trying to fill. Its vans are outfitted with mobile kitchens, and a trained chef travels on each truck, ingredients in tow, to finish off meals once the vehicle arrives at each house. ', 'Wonder’s goal is to deliver food that’s still piping hot when it reaches the front door. It tackles the pitfalls of takeout like limp french fries. And its salads aren’t soggy, since the vegetables were only tossed in the dressing moments before.', 'Jay Zuckerman, a 47-year-old father of two who resides with his wife in the pilot area, said his family has used Wonder about six or seven times for dinner over the past few months. ', 'Each time, Wonder’s chefs have placed the meal on a foldable tray table at their door, packaged in more elegant containers than one would typically receive from a delivery elsewhere. ', '“I thought it was such a different experience, and the timing could not have been more appropriate and needed during Covid,” said Zuckerman, a fashion industry executive. “It was like ordering from a gourmet restaurant, but you don’t have the issues of waiting, and you don’t have the issues of the food not tasting good because of transportation. It was a very high-end experience.” ', 'And it’s priced, accordingly.

One member of the group joked about seeing if Wonder would deliver to a blanket in Mindowaskin Park, a nearby grassy area that is within the designated zone.', 'But there are complaints, too. At the top of the list is the overwhelming presence of Wonder’s vans, which could be a sign that the business is ready to expand.

A spokesperson for Wonder declined to comment to CNBC about the demand it is seeing and about its expansion plans.', 'Before the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. consumers were eating more of their meals away from home. But that behavior sharply changed when states began implementing lockdowns last year. Using their stockpiled groceries, consumers cooked their own meals. They also ordered takeout and delivery, eating their meals at the kitchen table instead of inside a restaurant.

The company has already shipped tens of thousands of its chips to customers including Microsoft and Dell.', 'The Series E funding round, which comes less than a year after Graphcore raised a $150 million extension to its last round, values the company at $2.77 billion, up from $1.5 billion in 2018.', 'Graphcore CEO and co-founder Nigel Toon told CNBC in July: “We’re now at the point where we’re not really looking for venture investors in the business. We’re more interested in companies that would be long term investors and holders of the stock, perhaps, in the public markets, if we ever reach that point.”', 'At the time, Toon said going public is “ideally what we would like to do” but he stressed “lots of water still has to flow under the bridge before we get to that point.”', 'Total investment in Graphcore now stands at $710 million and the four-year-old company has $440 million of cash on hand.', 'The latest funding round was led by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board while other new investors included private equity investor Baillie Gifford, venture capital investor Draper Esprit, as well as funds managed by Fidelity International and Schroders.', 'On Tuesday, Toon said in a statement: “Having the backing of such respected institutional investors says something very powerful about how the markets now view Graphcore. The confidence that they have in us comes from the competence we have demonstrated building our products and our business.”', 'He added: “We have created a technology that dramatically outperforms legacy processors such as GPUs, a powerful set of software tools that are tailored to the needs of AI developers, and a global sales operation that is bringing our products to market.”', 'Graphcore was founded in June 2016 in Bristol, England, by Toon and Simon Knowles, who sold their previous chip company, Icera, to Nvidia for $435 million in 2011. The pair formed the initial idea for Graphcore in a small pub called the Marlborough Tavern in Bath in January 2012.', 'Today, the company employs around 450 people in Bristol, Cambridge, London, Beijing, Oslo, Palo Alto, Seattle, and Hsinchu in Taiwan.

Sixty-eight percent of that went to e-commerce and delivery businesses. Meal kits alone raised $6.2 billion, and e-commerce companies raised $5.3 billion within the food tech category. The largest deal last year was an $800 million round of funding for the Chinese group-buying app for groceries, Xingsheng Youxuan.', 'The world also saw how a crisis could disrupt the normal production, processing and distribution of food. Farmers had to dump milk and produce that couldn’t be shipped or stored, and conversely brick-and-mortar groceries had empty shelves after shoppers hoarded supplies.', 'Kukutai said that drove interest in growing food in controlled environments, such as vertical farms, where yields are predictable. These indoor farms are often built closer to the urban centers where much of the produce they grow will be consumed.', 'Agtech companies raised around $5 billion across 416 deals in 2020. The top 10 largest deals in agriculture tech included four rounds for indoor farming businesses, ranging from a $140 million round for Plenty to a $203 million round for Revol Greens.', 'Venture capitalists haven’t always been attracted to “agrifood.” Funds historically saw these businesses as capital-intensive and unlikely to generate big returns, although there were rare exceptions, such as Trinity Ventures’ investment in Starbucks years before its IPO in 1992.', 'In 2011, just $3 million in venture funding went to companies in agriculture tech, across a scant 42 deals, and $1 million in venture funding went to companies in food tech across 22 deals.', 'But that era has ended.', 'Historic deals that followed Starbucks’ lead attracted more and more venture investors to these sectors. For example, Monsanto acquired the weather data company Climate Corp. in 2013 for over $1 billion, and more recently, Beyond Meat made its public market debut. The plant-based meat company has seen its shares increase by more than 180% since its IPO in 2019.', 'Finistere was an early backer of Plenty, and other start-ups in their portfolio today are working on making meat in a lab from cultured cells (Memphis Meats), monitoring the health of hives in an apiary without disturbing any bees (Apis), and helping farmers identify threats to their crops early, using sensor-equipped drones and data analytics (Taranis).', 'CNBC asked Kukutai what trends are likely to wax or wane in 2021 where food and farming tech are concerned.', 'He worked for decades in agriculture before becoming an investor, and he grew up in New Zealand, where water pollution and cattle emissions are a growing concern. He said that 2020 may have been the year we reached “peak cow.”', 'The investor expects venture funding for alternative proteins and nondairy milk to remain strong throughout 2021. “Dairy and meat are still fundamental,” he noted. “But the way we produce them has a big environmental penalty.”', 'Alternative protein start-ups raised 2.6 times the money they did in 2019, clocking $3.1 billion in funding in 2020 compared with $858.7 million the year before.', 'Similarly, plant-based milks are soaring in popularity, with millennial and younger consumers decreasing purchases of traditional dairy along with beef, poultry and pork for environmental and health reasons.', 'Strong consumer demand should help keep investor interest and capital commitments high and lead to some attractive mergers and acquisitions for rising brands, Kukutai predicted.', 'Swedish vegan food makers Oatly recently filed to go public. The company’s oat-based milk is used as a dairy alternative by Starbucks, and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz was an early investor.', 'Finistere and Pitchbook’s 2020 Agrifood Tech Investment Review also notes that new kinds of alternative protein are in the works, made from cultured cells in a lab, rather than protein from plants or farmed insects.', 'By contrast, the investor said he expects funding to slow down in the second half of 2021 for many meal-kit, e-commerce and delivery businesses. His own fund has backed players in this space, including Good Eggs and Farmer’s Fridge.', 'Online ordering habits will continue well after the pandemic, now that people have gotten used to them, Kukutai said. But many businesses in this subsector managed to pull funding forward in 2020 to meet skyrocketing demand. They should be able to get through the next year of operations without raising more.', 'Instead, he’s expecting possible IPOs, SPACs or even M&A deals among some of these in 2021.', 'In agriculture, Kukutai predicts that a renewed focus on climate change and carbon emissions will influence what investors choose to fund over the next year.', 'The largest venture round in ag-tech last year saw Indigo raise around $500 million for tech and services that help farmers capture carbon through regenerative agriculture practices and then sell carbon credits.', 'New climate-related reporting requirements and pressure from ESGs — funds that score companies based on environment, social and governance criteria, not just financials and growth potential — are forcing every kind of business to measure their environmental footprint carefully, reduce their impact where they can, and buy carbon offsets to become compliant with regulations otherwise.', 'While that means different things to different companies, in farming it’s all about carefully monitoring and controlling what you grow and the environment it grows in, the investor said.', 'In 2021, food producers are able to use more targeted technologies in the field — for example, irrigation systems that can sense what’s needed at the plant level and in the root system, and data from satellites, drones and other sensing platforms that help them predict, plan and protect what they grow.', 'As they begin using internet-connected devices in the field, they are also building large libraries of data to enable more accurate predictions on everything from yield to weather. All the tech gives farmers better control of their crops and businesses.', '“When you control the environment, there is a lot you can do to make better tasting food,” Kukutai said. “And from a safety point of view, you can also protect plants from pathogens and bugs getting into them. That means less fertilizer and other inputs to treat them, which also means you’re preventing runoff of nitrogen, too. The more targeted and controlled you can be, the more virtuous.”']"
106,Microsoft unveils four Surface computers and a new folding phone,2021-09-22T16:00:01+0000,"['Microsoft announced five new Surface products on Wednesday, including a laptop, three tablets and a new folding phone.', 'Microsoft doesn’t make a lot of money from hardware. Just 4% of the company’s revenue in the second quarter came from devices. The global PC market is led by Lenovo, HP, Dell and Apple, according to Gartner’s estimates.', 'While these enhancements might help maintain Surface revenue growth, it’s more likely they’ll promote the forthcoming Windows 11 operating system and Office productivity applications, both of which are more meaningful parts of Microsoft’s business, and inspire the work of fellow device makers.', 'Windows 11 comes out on Oct. 5, and the new PCs and phone Microsoft announced will launch at the same time. Pre-orders begin Wednesday in select markets. That means the devices are launching after the back-to-school shopping rush but will be coming in time for the holidays.', 'Here’s a rundown of the new Surface devices:', 'Microsoft announced its first Surface Laptop Studio computer, which draws inspiration from its all-in-one Surface Studio 2 desktop, which still hasn’t been refreshed since 2018. The $1,600 Surface Laptop Studio will replace Microsoft’s existing Surface Laptop and offers a new design.', 'It has a special hinge that lets you tilt the 14-inch display at an angle that covers the keyboard, which brings the screen closer and makes it easier to write on. Or, you can flip it over and use the Laptop Studio like a tablet. Unlike the Surface Laptop, however, the screen doesn’t detach.', 'Customers can conceal and charge the new $130 Surface Slim Pen 2 beneath the Surface Laptop Studio’s keyboard. The new Surface Pen has a finer point than the model it replaces and contains a motor that gives haptic feedback in response to events in some programs. A haptic trackpad on the computer provides a more pleasant clicking experience than previous Surface machines.', 'Microsoft also announced its flagship Surface Pro 8 tablet. The company reportedly delayed the release last year. The Surface Pro 8 starts at $1,100, compared with the $750 starting price of the Surface Pro 7, which came out in 2019.', 'The new model has a 13-inch display, which is larger than the 12.3-inch display on its predecessor, although the tablet is now slightly wider and heavier. The display has an adaptive color feature that adjusts the white balance to make viewing more comfortable. It’s been available on Apple’s MacBooks for years. The screen also has a dynamic refresh rate of up to 120Hz, which can help save battery life and makes scrolling smoother.', 'An optional $180 detachable keyboard has a spot to stow away and charge the new Slim Pen. Consumers can configure the new system with 11th-generation Intel Core chips and as much as 32GB of RAM. Microsoft said Pro 8 gets as much as 16 hours of battery life, compared with up to 10.5 hours on the Pro 7.', 'Microsoft’s first Surface Duo smartphone was a flop. It launched last year with buggy software and specs that were behind similarly priced phones. The new Surface Duo 2 delivers some of the features missing from last year’s model, like several new cameras, 5G support, near-field communications for mobile payments and stereo speakers. And it comes with the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip used in other flagship phones like Samsung’s latest Galaxy devices.', 'Like last year’s version, the Surface Duo 2 opens up to reveal two 5.8-inch screens that can be used together. You might run one app on one screen and another on the opposite display, for example. Or, you can stretch a single app across both displays and take advantage of 8.3-inches of space.', 'The displays have a 90hz refresh rate, which should make scrolling and moving around apps smoother. Another new feature: when closed, the phone will show small notifications along the hinge.', 'It still isn’t as water-resistant as other phones and doesn’t have wireless charging.', 'The Surface Duo 2 starts at $1,500, which is $100 more than the original. It will ship in white or black.', 'Microsoft refreshed its Surface Go 3, a miniature version of its Surface Pro tablet. It starts at $400, without the keyboard, and can be configured with up to an Intel Core i3 chip, which Microsoft says is 60% faster than the chip used in last year’s Surface Go 2.', 'The company said the Surface Go 3 gets up to 11 hours of battery life, while the older version got up to 10. A variant with built-in LTE connectivity will become available in the next few months but, notably, 5G support is missing.', 'Lastly, Microsoft announced a new Wi-Fi-only version of the Surface Pro X, a tablet that was first launched in 2019 with LTE cellular support. It’s the first version to come with just Wi-Fi and it costs $900, down just $100 from the original model, even though it has the same chip and lacks any other notable hardware changes.', 'But, Windows 11 will enable the device to run specific 64-bit apps through emulation. That could mean people will be able to run more apps than they could when the first model launched.', 'WATCH: Microsoft announced $60 billion stock buyback program']"

', '“For every one shot we’ve administered to date in America, we have now committed to do three shots to the rest of the world,” the president said. ', 'The EU has committed to donate over 500 million vaccine doses.', 'The WHO previously set a December deadline for vaccinating 40% of the world’s population, and hopes to vaccinate 10% of the population in every country by the end of September.', 'However, a widening inequality in global vaccination rates may prevent these goals from being met, with poorer countries lagging far behind wealthy ones.', 'The U.S. has fully immunized 54% of its population, and the 27 countries of the European Union have fully vaccinated 61% of their combined population, according to public health authorities. ', 'Yet in Africa, less than 3.5% of the continent’s eligible population is fully immunized against the virus, according to the WHO. The global health body has repeatedly opposed the distribution of booster shots in wealthy countries, requesting that they redirect their surplus vaccines to lower-income nations.', 'However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday authorized booster shots for people 65 and older as well as other vulnerable Americans. The FDA’s decision was in line with the recommendations of its vaccine advisory committee, which had cautioned against boosters for the general population.', 'Biden echoed the WHO’s call to aid poorer countries, urging global leaders on Wednesday and in his address to the United Nations Tuesday to step up their efforts to help vaccinate the world.', '“Nothing is more urgent than all of us working together to defeat Covid-19,” Biden said at the Wednesday summit. ', 'Through the new partnership, the U.S. and EU will work together to bolster the supply and delivery of vaccinations around the world. Biden proposed another virtual summit sometime “in the first quarter of 2022” to assess its progress.', 'The partnership will build on the efforts of a manufacturing and supply chain taskforce established after the U.S.-EU Summit in June, which pledged to resolve issues regarding global vaccine production.', 'The taskforce met in Washington, D.C., last week to identify its current priorities, including monitoring global supply chains for Covid vaccines, addressing disruptions in such supply chains and boosting vaccine production, according to a White House statement Wednesday. ', 'Biden also highlighted on Wednesday that the U.S. will provide an additional $370 million to countries for the administration and delivery of vaccines. So far, the Biden administration has invested more than $15 billion toward the global Covid-19 response.', 'More than $380 million will also be given to the Global Vaccine Alliance, the organization overseeing daily operations for the COVAX vaccination project, Biden said at Wednesday’s summit.']"

109,That sweater you don’t like is a trillion-dollar problem for retailers. These companies want to fix it,2019-01-12T19:00:53+0000,"['As online sales boom, there’s an inevitable side effect: More merchandise is getting returned, boosting costs and complexity for retailers. ', 'The shift can be staggering. ', '“Shoppers return 5 to 10 percent of what they purchase in store but 15 to 40 percent of what they buy online,” David Sobie, co-founder and CEO of Happy Returns told CNBC.', 'Not being able to see an item in person accounts for part of the difference, but consumers also shop differently online than in-store, Sobie said. They may order multiple sizes or colors to try on at home, and then ship or take back what they don’t want, with shipping paid for by the retailer, both ways in some cases.', 'With costs mounting, understanding why shoppers return items and dealing with the logistics is a key issue that retailers are only beginning to tackle. A number of new businesses are sprouting up to try and wrangle the problem for retailers. These companies say higher rates of online shopping and more lax return policies are factors contributing to the rise of returns. However, there are more options for what to do with the returns, which can help to keep tons of unwanted items out of landfills and save retailers’ profit margins. ', 'Average return rates vary by category, but clothing and shoes bought online typically have the highest rates with 30 to 40 percent returned.', 'Eric Moriarty, vice president of B-Stock Solutions, a liquidation marketplace said as e-commerce becomes a bigger percentage of retail sales, more returns will be coming back.', '“In 2018, it will be somewhere in the area of $400 billion worth of inventory ... with $90 [billion] to $95 billion returned post-holiday,” he said.', 'In the next several years, as e-commerce grows globally, “the amount of returns is going to be over a trillion dollars a year,” Tobin Moore, CEO and co-founder of reverse logistics technology company Optoro, said.', 'Another factor adding to rising returns is more relaxed return policies. As retailers fight for market share in an increasingly competitive industry, return policies are allowing longer windows to bring back items. Also, retailers are often accepting online returns in stores, even if the items were never sold at the store. ', 'According to a Happy Returns survey, nearly three-quarters of Americans say returns are their least favorite part of shopping online, so an easy return system is crucial for retaining shoppers.', 'More items are returned during and after the holiday season than any other time of year. UPS estimates 1 million returns were made daily during December leading up to Christmas, largely from consumers that shopped early to take advantage of promotions and faster shipping options.', 'But once the returned goods are back in the hands of a retailer, less than half are resold at full-price, according to Gartner Research. That translates to retailers losing out on 10 percent of sales during the holiday season, a trend that has not improved over the last couple years, and is expected to get worse.', 'While returns are a big problem for retail, only about 30 percent of the country’s largest retailers quantify its full cost and only 23 percent use some kind of technology or software to better manage it, according to Optoro.', 'In aggregate, “retailers are losing billions and billions of dollars on the way returns are managed,” Moore said. “A lot of retailers can add 5 percent to their bottom line by better optimizing the management and resale of their returns.”', '“Many retailers end up throwing away over 25 percent of their returns,” Moore said. “Holistically, that ends up being over 5 billion pounds of goods that end up in landfills a year from returns.”', 'He estimates over the next several years that could swell to 10 billion pounds of returns in landfills around the world.', 'For the 75 percent that doesn’t go to a landfill, the condition of the returned item, the timing of when it’s returned, and its location are all key factors in determining what comes next. Some merchandise is inspected and immediately restocked. Some has to be sent for refurbishing or repackaging. Other goods go to a liquidation channel where the items are repurchased by a reseller or consumer. There are occasional scenarios where returned goods are taken apart and components are recycled, or even “upcycled,” like turning shoes into a racetrack, Moore said.', 'Return scenarios have gotten more complicated. More relaxed return policies can mean shoppers return items after a season ends, making it hard to sell a winter coat in March, for example. ', 'Plus, the internet offers retailers an “endless aisle.” That means many items are sold online only. If those purchases are returned to a store, the retailer will have a few choices: ship it back to a distribution or processing center; try to resell it as a one-off item in the store; liquidate, donate or recycle it or throw it away.', 'About 70 percent of high-end apparel can typically be restocked and resold, Moore said. If it’s a consumer electronics item or home and garden item that was sealed and isn’t anymore, or has any data on it, it has to be repackaged, refurbished and wiped of data. Only around 30 percent of those returned items can go back into stock immediately.', 'According to a spokesperson for Amazon.com, “once we receive a returned product we conduct a thorough inspection to determine if it can be sold to another customer as either ‘new’ or ‘used.’ If sellable as new, it goes back on the shelf. If we determine it can be sold as used, the team takes the necessary steps to ensure it is a quality product that customers will be happy with once purchased. We work hard to reduce the amount that goes to liquidation.”', 'Best Buy uses a number of methods to minimize the cost of returns, including selling open box items on its website and hosting a sales event for open box merchandise right after Christmas. The retailer also has a small number of Best Buy Outlets where open box and slightly damaged major appliances are sold.', 'B-Stock is another channel Best Buy uses to liquidate merchandise.', '“Retailers are looking for new ways to make money and find margin,” B-Stock’s Moriarty said. “There are macro trends making returns increase over time, and there are better mouse traps out there today that make it less costly to handle a return.”', 'B-Stock builds individual online marketplaces for retailers or brands to sell returned, liquidated or excess merchandise in bulk quantities to certified resellers. Moriarty said the volume of inventory sold on its site grew 100 percent from 2017 to 2018. In addition to Best Buy, B-Stock clients include Walmart, Amazon, Macy’s, Lowe’s, GameStop, and J.C. Penney, among others. While B-Stock offers the option for warehouse storage of merchandise at CH Robinson warehouses throughout the country, B-Stock never takes financial ownership nor logistics control of the inventory being resold.', '“Typically, our clients get a 30 to 80 percent price increase from how they used to do it,” Moriarty said, even in the online auction website format B-Stock sets up for the retailers. Retailers can restrict where a reseller can sell items. For example, they can require resellers to export the merchandise. Moriarty said much of the inventory is resold on Amazon, eBay or in other small local stores.', 'Optoro sells software platforms to retailers and brands that identify the best option for maximizing the value or lowering the cost of returned items on a case-by-case basis. Options could include restocking, refurbishing, liquidating, donating or recycling. Its clients include Target, Under Armour, Jet, BJ’s Wholesale Club, Staples, and Groupon. Optoro also has its own liquidation channels, Blinq.com, for liquidation resale to consumers, and Bulq.com, for liquidation resale to resellers.', '“We can increase a retailer or brand’s return recovery amount, in many cases, by 25 percent. If it is items that are not going back in stock, we can double or triple the recovery in some cases,” Moore said.', 'Happy Returns offers technologies and logistics at nearly 300 U.S. locations to allow online purchases to be returned in person when the retailer doesn’t have a physical store. Direct-to-consumer brand start-ups like Everlane, Untuckit and Rothy’s work with Happy Returns, which has put its so-called return bars in malls, on college campuses and even stores like Sur La Table and Paper Source. Happy Returns packages it up for the shopper, sorts the returns by retailer, then ships in bulk to return hubs less expensively than the postal service offers.', '“In aggregate, Happy Returns sees a cost savings upwards of 25 percent for our retailers,” said Happy Returns’ Sobie. He attributes this to the combination of hard cost savings of its network compared to shipping and the soft savings of lowering customer service inquires.', 'While there are technologies to reduce returns like 3D body scanning and other fit innovations, “it’s not working,” Sobie said.', 'Keeping shoppers happy is harder to quantify, but extremely valuable.', '“Returns is a battleground for customers,” Moore said. “It’s a way to win more customers, to get them coming back and to get data so that you know how to better stock items and better make items for your customers as well.”']"
110,"Here’s how Apple’s AirTag trackers compare to Tile, and why the company is so upset with Apple",2021-04-27T12:52:01+0000,"['Apple’s $29 AirTag lost item tracker begins shipping on April 30. I walked through what it’s like last week, but I recently bought a similar tracker from Tile.', 'Tile has been in the lost item tracking business for several years, and now counts Apple as its closest competitor.', 'I took both devices for a test drive to show you how they differ and to help explain why Tile is so upset that Apple is moving in on its turf.', 'Tile trackers aren’t new. They’ve been around for years and have been leading the market. Owners seem to love them. They’re convenient because you can attach them to bags, keys or other items, and then see where they are on a map on your phone.', 'Like AirTag, Tile trackers don’t use GPS. Instead, they rely on a network of other Tile devices that communicate with each other over Bluetooth. So, the more Tile devices there are out there, the greater your chances that someone with a Tile passes by yours and alerts your phone of your lost item’s location. Tile has sold more than 35 million devices, not including products from more than 30 partners with its technology built-in, which make up its network that spans 195 countries.', 'Apple’s AirTag is similar, except it taps into not only other AirTags but also Apple’s existing network of iPhones and Macs, which is nearing a billion devices. That gives Apple an advantage over Tile from the get-go, since it has a bigger network at launch, even if lots of people don’t buy an AirTag.', 'Here are a few of the things I like about Tile that you don’t get with Apple AirTag:', 'But the biggest difference is the experience. AirTag is a lot more seamless since you just pull the battery tag and click “connect” on your iPhone.', 'With Tile, you need to download a separate app, instead of using Apple’s Find My, which comes pre-installed on all of its devices, then give the app permission to use your location twice during setup. It’s something Tile has complained to Congress about because the company thinks Apple’s own product has the advantage here.', 'And while Apple’s Find My network is open to other companies that want to support it, it’s not in Tile’s best interest to do so.', 'Tile, for example, lets you find lost devices nearby and far away for free. But its subscription services, including Premium ($2.99/month or $29.99 a year) and Premium Protect ($99.99 a year), rely on its network, not Apple’s. That’s why it probably isn’t as excited to launch devices that support Apple Find My as companies that aren’t in the tracking space at all.', 'The Premium plan can help you get smart alerts if you leave something behind, includes a free battery replacement, lets you share a tracker’s location with friends, shows a 30-day location history and more. Premium Protect includes those features and offers up to a $1,000 item reimbursement if you can’t find it, so it’s kind of like an insurance program for your stuff.', 'AirTag owners who use an iPhone 11 or iPhone 12 model also get another advantage from AirTag. Those phones can locate the AirTag right down to its exact location using an ultra-wideband signal. You just hold up your phone and it points you in which direction to walk to find your lost item. Tile doesn’t have access to this part of the iPhone, even though it developed support for its trackers, so it can’t offer this feature. It’s one of the complaints the company has had with Apple rolling out its own tracking product and it brought this up just last week with Congress.', 'Another differentiator: AirTag also has privacy controls. It will alert you if someone else’s AirTag seems to be with you, instead of with them, for too long. That might help prevent people from using them to track you.', 'It’s up to you which one to buy. I like the sticker and form factors of Tile and that I can ring my phone by pressing a button on it. It also works on Android, which is a big benefit. Apple’s AirTag is a hair faster to set up, has ultra-wideband, and it has a bigger network that might make it easier to find your lost device since there are more people with iPhones and Macs than Tile trackers.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

Belarus authorities argued it was a security threat that required the landing of the plane.', 'The 27-member states of the EU stepped up sanctions against Belarus in the wake of the incident, but the tensions between the two sides continue to simmer.', 'Lithuania, Latvia and Poland, which share a land border with Belarus, have reported an increasing number of migrants and refugees, notably Iraqi and Afghan citizens, coming from their shared neighbor. Lithuania has started building a fence on its border with Belarus, while Poland has declared a state of emergency.', 'The three countries have accused Belarus of flying in migrants from the Middle East to then send across their borders.', 'This is a “real headache for the EU,” Bob Deen, senior research fellow at the think tank Clingendael, told CNBC. He added that the Belarus regime “is exploiting a weakness of the EU and weaponizing refugees.”', 'Migration is a weak point in European policymaking.', 'The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, has recently presented a plan to bolster its response to migration issues. But so far the bloc mostly relies on help from third nations to stem large inflows of migrants and refugees. This makes the EU highly dependent on countries like Turkey and Belarus.', 'Sergio Carrera, head of justice and home affairs at the think tank CEPS, told CNBC there is a “vulnerability” in the EU with its dependence on other nations.', 'The bloc “needs a robust policy to deal with this,” he said.', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged Wednesday the need for a stronger and more united approach.', '“Look at what happened at our borders with Belarus. The regime in Minsk has instrumentalized human beings. They have put people on planes and literally pushed them towards Europe’s borders. But as long as we do not find common ground on how to manage migration, our opponents will continue to target that,” she said at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.', 'The commission has supported Lithuania, Latvia and Poland in dealing with the issue, but experts want to see more.', '“There are other countries observing [that],” Vytis Jurkonis, project director at the think tank Freedom House, told CNBC last month.', '“Today it’s Belarus, tomorrow could be Russia,” he said, suggesting that other nations could use migrants and refugees as a way to destabilize the EU.', 'Added to this, there are concerns in Brussels regarding the close ties between Belarus and Russia.', 'Russia conducted a large-scale military exercise in September alongside Belarus.

112,Target’s holiday sales could get a boost from Chip and Joanna Gaines’ new collection,2017-10-23T05:01:00+0000,"['Last holiday season marked a turning point for Target.', 'After several quarters of choppy performance, sales and profit fell in the holiday quarter, forcing the retailer to take a deeper look at its operations. The result: it launched a new strategy to spend $7 billion over three years to build new stores and remodel existing ones, and improve both its digital and in-store experience.', '“We are going into the fourth quarter with a lot of optimism and a lot of confidence,” said Rick Gomez, Target’s chief marketing officer. His tone is upbeat compared to the retailer’s most recent guidance for the key fourth quarter. Target expects the quarter’s comparable sales to be in line with the performance of the first and second quarter, or a range of negative 1.3 percent to positive 1.3 percent.', 'The retailer needs the holiday to be a bullseye, as it gets about 30 percent of its annual sales in the fourth quarter, and it’s hinging hope on Chip and Joanna Gaines.', 'The founders of the Magnolia company certainly seem to draw a crowd to their hit HGTV show “Fixer Upper” and their Silos market in Waco, Texas. The lovable home-renovation-and-design couple’s exclusive Target “Hearth & Hand” collection launches Nov. 5.', 'Target Chief Merchandising Officer Mark Tritton expects “Hearth & Hand” will prompt additional shopping trips and boost traffic to both the stores and website.', '“The initial response has been exponential,” Tritton said. He characterized site visits to the web page built to announce the collection as “off the charts. Two to three times traffic for anything else we have done.”', 'In fact, Target is building a new physical space to house the brand’s tabletop, home decor, and “giftable” items, like a dollhouse and toy workbench, in 550 stores, and configuring a smaller, slightly different set-up in the others. ', '“Hearth & Hand” is one of the eight Target brands that will be available for the first time this holiday season. Big exclusive brands are key components for Target’s success. One example is the 15-month-brand Cat & Jack. The children’s apparel brand is already worth $2.1 billion, said  CEO Brian Cornell.', 'The big box retailer is again getting rid of its $35 minimum for free shipping, though for a slightly shorter period of time. This year, free shipping runs from Nov. 1 until Dec. 23, while last year it ran from Oct. 25 until Jan. 1.', 'Helping shoppers with gifts is high on Target’s priority list this year, with offers like the new “GiftNow” option online. Mike McNamara, Target’s chief information and digital officer said that it’s perfect when you aren’t sure exactly what to get, but you want to at least try to pick something. Shoppers give an “electronic gift box” and then the recipient can choose to accept the selected gift, or change the color or size for instance, before it’s shipped.', 'The retailer also has 1,700 gift ideas for consumers, most under $15, and most unique to Target.', 'Target has also increased the number of stores fulfilling online orders this holiday season to 1,400 from 1,100 last year. That means nearly three-quarters of its stores are able to ship products with the goal of getting goods to shoppers faster and more efficiently.', 'McNamara is trying to capture that “Tar-jay” magic online for the holidays and beyond. “If we can focus on just ‘being Target’ online, I know we can win in fourth quarter and the year.”', 'While Target had 10 Days of Deals each of the last two holiday seasons, interest waned in 2016 over the year prior. So this year, the retailer is going to offer Weekend Deals starting in mid-November, but it was mum on specifics other than to say it would vary from “household essentials to holiday must-haves.”', 'Toys are a key part of Target’s holiday plan, with half of the retailer’s total annual toy sales coming in the fourth quarter. The big box retailer will have more than 1,400 new and exclusive toys — down from 1,800 last year — and 70-plus board games shoppers can only get at Target like Bob Ross: The Art of Chill, Netflix “Stranger Things” toys and lots of Star Wars products. ', 'Family pajama sets have been a hit for Target, thanks in part to the desire to share photos on social media. In 2016, holiday pajama sales grew double-digits over the year prior. This year, Target’s expanding the family options to include matching pjs for the family dog and children’s dolls.', 'Correction: This story was revised to state that Target’s free shipping offer runs from Nov. 1 to Dec. 23.']"
113,Jeff Bezos unveils lunar lander to take astronauts to the moon by 2024,2019-05-09T20:42:57+0000,"['WASHINGTON — Jeff Bezos, chairman of Amazon and founder of Blue Origin, unveiled his space company’s lunar lander for the first time on Thursday.', '“This vehicle is going to the moon,” Bezos said during an invite-only presentation to media and space industry executives.', '“We were given a gift — this nearby body called the moon,” Bezos said. He added that the moon is a good place to begin manufacturing in space due to its lower gravity than the Earth. Getting resources from the moon “takes 24 times less energy to get it off the surface compared to the Earth,” Bezos said, and “that is a huge lever.”', 'The Blue Moon lander can bring 3.6 metric tons to the lunar surface, according to Bezos.', 'Bezos also unveiled the company’s BE-7 rocket engine at the event. The engine will be test fired for the first time this summer, Bezos said. It’s largely made of “printed” parts, he added.', '“We need the new engine and that’s what this is,” Bezos said.', 'BE-7 photo', '“It’s time to go back to the moon and this time stay,” Bezos said.', 'Blue Origin, established nearly two decades ago, has remained relatively quiet about the rockets, engines and capsules it is developing. With its Latin tagline of “step by step, ferociously,” Blue Origin has been working on multiple space systems at the same time. Bezos invests more than $1 billion in the company each year, through sales of his Amazon shares.', 'Vice President Mike Pence earlier this year directed NASA to return U.S. astronauts to the surface of the moon within the next five years. NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine answered by saying the agency will meet the White House’s directive, which represents an acceleration of NASA’s existing lunar exploration timeline. NASA’s fiscal 2020 budget request included a massive increase in funding of the the Advanced Cislunar and Surface Capabilities (ACSC) program. Under ACSC, the agency would first send robots to the surface without crews, later following up with astronauts. Despite internal hesitancy, NASA is considering commercial alternatives such as Blue Origin for getting astronauts to the moon’s surface.', '“I love Vice President Pence’s 2024 lunar landing goal,” Bezos said, adding that Blue Origin can meet that timeline “because we started this three years ago.”', 'Ahead of the event, Blue Origin tweeted a cryptic photo of famed explorer Ernest Shackleton’s ship and a date, May 9, in the caption. A teaser for Thursday’s event, the photo appeared to hint that Bezos’ announcement would focus on sending cargo and even astronauts to the south pole of the moon. That’s because Shackelton lends his name to a crater on the moon’s surface, which NASA named after the explorer in 2006 due to its potential as a lunar outpost. Located at the moon’s south pole, the Shackleton crater is believed by many to have deposits of frozen water.', 'Bezos offered only few details two years ago about Blue Origin’s lunar ambitions. In a program the company called “Blue Moon,” it would send a couple tons of cargo to the surface of the moon, to begin building the infrastructure of a lunar base. The first mission was proposed for 2020, in partnership with government programs like the Boeing-built NASA Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. But in May of last year, Bezos indicated Blue Origin may develop Blue Moon on its own.', 'Blue Origin’s most visible program has been its New Shepard rocket system, which the company is developing to send tourists to the edge of space for 10 minutes. New Shepard has flown on 11 test flights, with its capsule, built to carry six passengers, reaching an altitude of more than 350,000. The capsule features massive windows, providing expansive views of the Earth once in space.', 'The company plans to send its first humans onboard a New Shepard rocket sometime in the next year. But it has yet to begin selling tickets. Blue Origin told CNBC last year that it will only offer tourists a ride to space “after our first human flights.”', 'Additionally, New Shepard has served as a test bed for the company to develop its own reusability system. Like SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets, the largest part of the New Shepard rocket — the first stage “booster” — comes back and lands on a concrete pad shortly after launch.', 'Reusing rockets is a key development in the space industry as companies look to reduce the cost of sending humans, satellites, experiments and more to space. Blue Origin is building an immense rocket system, called New Glenn. Similar to New Shepard, the company plans to land New Glenn’s rocket booster on a ship in the ocean', 'Bezos’ ultimate ambition is to help humanity expand across the solar system, with a human population of more than a trillion living and working in space. Morgan Stanley highlighted Bezos’ investments in space as a “force” in the industry who brings financial muscle unlike any other. Blue Origin is one of several space companies which Morgan Stanley said “will up the ante” this year.']"

Kuo is known for accurately predicting Apple hardware releases before they are official because he keeps such close tabs on the company’s supply chain.', 'In 2022, Apple’s high-end “pro” models could include a new design with a “punch-hole” display for the front-facing camera, instead of the notch on current devices. These phones could also be equipped with a 48-megapixel wide-lens camera, Kuo wrote. That would mean much sharper images.', 'Apple could also release new lower-cost iPhones next year, Kuo wrote, including a less expensive iPhone SE with 5G connectivity. The current model SE retails for $399. Apple is also working on a “more affordable” iPhone with a 6.7-inch screen, Kuo said. Apple’s current phone with that size screen, the iPhone 13 Pro Max, retails for $1,099 or more.', 'Kuo warned that all these predictions depend on Apple’s and its suppliers’ development process and that he had previously predicted some of these devices would release sooner.', '“We predict that the new 2H23 iPhone will support under-display fingerprint,” Kuo wrote, using a term for the second half of 2023. “However, the foldable design may be the most critical selling point for high-end smartphones by then, so we still need to monitor the contribution of the under-display fingerprint to the shipment of the new 2H23 iPhone.”', 'Apple investors are curious whether this year’s iPhones can continue to grow sales despite new models with marginal improvements such as better battery life. The iPhone 12 has been a hot seller. IPhone revenue was up 50% year-over-year last quarter.', 'Ultimately, Kuo expects 16% year-over-year growth in terms of the number of iPhones shipped in 2022, which would be mostly iPhone 13 sales, and 5%-7% growth in 2023.', 'This year, preorders for the iPhone 13 reflect higher demand than last year’s preorders for iPhone 12 models, Kuo said. Apple’s new iPhones will hit store shelves Friday, and preorders opened last week for customers who want to receive their devices on the first day. The delivery estimates on Apple’s website for preordered iPhones are a useful tool to gauge consumer demand for the new devices, Kuo wrote.', 'Preorder demand is higher for the more expensive new models, the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max, which start at $999 instead of $699 for the mainstream models, Kuo said.', 'Although Apple has warned about issues getting the parts that it needs to build its devices in the current quarter, Kuo believes that Apple has increased production for its high-end devices and that supply is better than last year because the company addressed a shortage of telephoto camera parts.']"

They go from ship to ship, port to port, through quite a journey.”', 'Distributed ledgers are groupings of data shared across multiple locations without the need for central administrators and other middle men.', 'The original blockchain was built to serve as the distributed ledger for bitcoin transactions. But various blockchain experts believe the technology can provide transparency for a multitude of different industries, not just the financial services.', '“We’re not talking about a new currency here, we’re not talking about money. We’re talking about data aggregation,” EY’s Crawford added.', 'Maersk said the blockchain platform would enable the shipping giant to maintain a smoother relationship with the insurance market.', '“It is a priority for us to leverage technology to streamline and automate our interaction with the insurance market,” Lars Henneberg, head of risk and insurance at Maersk said in a statement Wednesday.', '“Insurance transactions are currently far too tedious and frictional. The distance between risk and capital is simply too far. Blockchain technology has the potential to facilitate the desired development that is long overdue.”', 'Marine insurance has traditionally relied on physical contracts being shipped to and fro, from one port to another, in order to be eventually signed, according to EY.', 'The global research firm has worked closely with software security company Guardtime to develop the blockchain platform.', 'Guardtime said it expects to roll out blockchain to the wider insurance industry after its initial marine insurance deployment.', '“Initially, we focused on marine insurance as it is well-suited to a blockchain solution as it has a complex international ecosystem, with multiple parties, multiple jurisdictions, high transaction volumes and significant levels of reconciliation,” Guardtime CEO Mike Gault told CNBC in an emailed note prior to the announcement.', '“But down the line we expect it to be rolled out across other areas of insurance markets — as there are clearly shared benefits and attributes. In fact, blockchain can be applied to any commercial or specialty line of business with high-value assets.”', 'The blockchain solution was built on Microsoft’s cloud platform,  Microsoft Azure.', 'Cloud technology allows firms to store data and software via the internet rather than locally on a hard drive.', 'A proof of concept for EY’s digital ledger was completed in March.', '“When we built the proof of concept, we built a prototype on Azure to make sure the whole thing worked and is secure, and now what we’re doing is building it,” EY’s Crawford noted.', '“We provide that cloud service which we believe is one of the strongest ones on the market, and that’s why we chose Microsoft to work with.”', 'Guardtime said Microsoft’s cloud offered a secure network on which to build the blockchain.', '“For any new system to be implemented it needs to be built using the right model, one that is robust, scalable and can co-exist with existing IT infrastructure or systems,” Guardtime’s Gault said.', '“That’s what Azure and the cloud technology enables us to do, without comprising performance or flexibility, which is why it was so important to partner with Microsoft.”', 'Mark Russinovish, chief technology officer at Microsoft Azure, said that blockchain had the potential to be “transformational.”', '“Microsoft believes blockchain is a transformational technology with the ability to significantly reduce the friction of doing business, especially streamlining business processes shared across multiple organizations,” he said.', 'He added: “Marine insurance is a prime example of a complex business process that can be optimized with blockchain.”', 'Insurers MS Amlin and XL Catlin also collaborated with EY on the project, as well as insurance industry body ACORD (Association for Cooperative Operations Research and Development).', 'The blockchain solution is set to be implemented from January 2018 onwards.', 'The race to create large distributed ledger network has become increasingly competitive.', 'IBM for instance announced it would partner with food giants like Nestle and Unilever in August, and use blockchain technology to trace the movements of food to avoid tackle contamination faster.', 'EY told CNBC that its decision to make the announcement ahead of time was due to a host of other players making similar moves.']"
120,Elon Musk says SpaceX’s Starship rocket will launch ‘hundreds of missions’ before flying people,2020-09-01T14:56:17+0000,"['SpaceX is developing its next-generation Starship rocket to one day launch dozens of people to space, but CEO Elon Musk emphasized that the rocket has many milestones to go before it can take passengers.', '“We’ve got to first make the thing work; automatically deliver satellites and do hundreds of missions with satellites before we put people on board,” Musk said, speaking  Monday at the virtual “Humans to Mars” conference.', 'Starship represents the company’s top priority, as Musk wants to build a fully reusable rocket system that can launch cargo or as many as 100 people at a time. While SpaceX’s current Falcon fleet of rockets is partially reusable, as the company can land and reuse the rocket’s boosters, Musk hopes Starship transforms space travel into something more akin to commercial air travel. ', 'The rocket’s enormous size would also make it capable of launching several times as much cargo at once — for comparison, while SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets can send as many as 60 Starlink satellites at a time, SpaceX says Starship will be able to launch 400 Starlink satellites at a time.', 'The company has rapidly built up its facility in Boca Chica, Texas, where it has now conducted short flight tests of early Starship prototypes. But the Starship development program has suffered several explosive setbacks in the past year. Musk recently shifted the company’s focus to Starship, saying in June that progress on the rocket must accelerate “dramatically and immediately” – and three months later, Musk’s urgency appears to be getting results.', '“We’re making good progress,” Musk said. “The thing that really impedes progress on Starship is the production system ... A year ago there was nothing there and now we’ve got quite a lot of production capability. So we’re rapidly making more and more ships.”', 'When Musk unveiled the Starship prototype in September 2019, he was hopeful that SpaceX could get the rocket to orbit by March of this year – and even flying people in 2020. But his tone has shifted since then, as he warned Monday that the first Starship launches to orbit “might not work,” saying that SpaceX is in “uncharted territory.” He now expects Starship’s first orbital flight test won’t come until next year.', '“Nobody has ever made a fully reusable, orbital rocket,” Musk said.', 'He also said that SpaceX has not done much work yet on the design of the cabin or interior of Starship for passengers. Notably, Musk highlighted that SpaceX has experience making “a complex life support system that can deal with a wide range of environments,” as the company’s Crew Dragon capsule successfully transported a pair of NASA astronauts to-and-from the International Space Station on a mission this summer.', 'Work at the Boca Chica facility is continuing toward Starship’s next flight test, with Musk saying the company will begin construction of the first Super Heavy booster prototype “this week.” Super Heavy is the large bottom half of Starship rocket, which has most of the engines and is used during for the beginning of a launch.', 'SpaceX has continued to raise private funding for its programs, with the company most recently seeking nearly $2.1 billion in an equity round of investment. SpaceX’s equity fundraising in the past two years totals about $3.75 billion, with its valuation reportedly climbing to $46 billion.', 'In the near term, SpaceX plans for Starship to fly missions to low Earth orbit and then to the Moon. But Mars remains Musk’s long-term goal. The company will reach the red planet “given enough time,” Musk said, but “the question is: How long it will it take us?”', '“And getting to Mars, I think, is not the fundamental issue. The fundamental issue is building a base, building a city on Mars that is self-sustaining,” Musk said. “We’re going to build a propellant plant, an initial Mars base – Mars Base Alpha – and then get it to the point where it’s self-sustaining.”', '“I want to emphasize that this is a very hard and dangerous, difficult thing, not for the faint of heart,” he added. “Good chance you’ll die, it’s going to be tough going, but it will be pretty glorious if it works out.”', 'Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.']"
121,"Amazon, Panasonic, and recycling start-ups prepare for battery wave tsunami ",2020-12-12T15:00:02+0000,"['Inside every smartphone and tablet lies a dense brick with a dark and complex history: its battery. The lithium that ferries charge back and forth likely started out in South American salt flats, where months of evaporation consumes millions of tons of water in some of the world’s driest regions. The cobalt that buffers the material against the ravages of daily recharging probably came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where children have allegedly been maimed and killed extracting it from the ground. To gather the assorted atoms and fashion them into a working battery may have required thousands of people from perhaps a dozen countries. Then, after a few years of use, spent devices often end up in landfills and incinerators. ', 'As lithium-ion batteries stand poised to jump from handheld devices into cars, trucks, and homes, entrepreneurs and academics are racing to find a way to reuse the hard-won materials. Investors are betting millions that a Nevada company, Redwood Materials, can mine electronic waste for metals. A competitor, Li-Cycle, aims to crack the logistical puzzle of transporting batteries. Others are developing the technology to rejuvenate dead batteries without breaking them down fully. By attacking the problem on all fronts, the teams work toward one goal: transforming exhausted batteries into a valuable resource.', '“We’re spending all of this money making batteries, making chemicals, and then we’re burning them at the end of the cycle,” says Tim Johnston, Li-Cycle co-founder and executive chairman. “That’s not right.”', 'Industry insiders speak with excitement and trepidation of a looming battery “tsunami.” Globally people already toss out more than 500,000 tons of lithium batteries today, according to Ajay Kochhar, Li-Cycle co-founder and president, mostly in the form of small electronics. But as the world transitions to an electric economy, its appetite for lithium-ion bricks is projected to increase tenfold by 2030. Most of that explosion will be driven by electric vehicles, which carry batteries weighing more than 1,000 pounds. “We’re at the tip of the iceberg,” Kochhar says.', 'Kochhar and others see that problem as an opportunity to replace today’s fragile and problematic supply chain with a more “circular” system, one that builds the next generation of batteries from the materials of the last generation. And they won’t be recycling just for the sake of recycling. The market for recycling lithium-ion batteries alone could be worth $18 billion annually by 2030, Statista estimates, up from $1.5 billion in 2019.  ', 'One start-up leading the U.S. market is Redwood Materials, the latest venture of Tesla co-founder JB Straubel. During the 16 years he spent working as Tesla’s CTO, Straubel realized that there was no plan for processing the cars at the end of their lifespan. And unlike a phone, a half-ton car battery can’t just languish at the back of a junk drawer. Most electric vehicles are currently in their prime (Straubel drives what he believes is the oldest Tesla on the planet — a Roadster prototype from the late 2000s), but the tsunami will begin when early electric cars will start retiring en masse in the next five years.', 'Since launching in 2017, Redwood Materials has been preparing for that first wave. Located in Carson City, the start-up’s two facilities currently handle all the waste materials and defective batteries coming out of the nearby Tesla Gigafactory, co-owned by Panasonic. Panasonic scrap alone provides about one gigawatt of material annually and a dozen other partners contribute a similar amount, for a total equivalent of about 20,000 tons of material per year. The company also recently partnered with Amazon to dispose of batteries from the retail giant.', 'After sorting recent arrivals, the company uses proprietary processes involving a combination of burning batteries to melt their contents and submerging them in liquids that leach out desired elements (although the exact procedure is tailored to fit the battery type). In the end, a PR spokesperson said, the techniques recover 95% to 98% of a battery’s nickel, cobalt, aluminum, graphite, and more than 80% of its lithium. Much of those materials are sold back to Panasonic to make new Tesla batteries.', '“Redwood Materials has assembled an excellent team that is working collaboratively with us to tackle a wide range of waste streams, and to develop raw materials that we can then use in our cell making processes,” says Celina Mikolajczak, v.p. of battery technology, Panasonic Energy of North America.', 'The company is currently working on increasing the capacity of its Carson City facilities with the help of $40 million in funding from Capricorn Investment Group and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, an environmental investment fund including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.', 'Johnston and Kochhar came to found Li-Cycle in a similar way, launching it in 2016 after working together at Hatch, a global engineering firm specializing in battery chemicals. They’ve structured their business around a ‘hub and spoke’ model.', 'Because batteries are fire hazards, they can be expensive to transport safely. To keep distances down, Li-Cycle intends to collect batteries at local “spoke” facilities, which shred the bricks into three components: plastic casings, mixed metals (such as foils), and the active materials like cobalt and nickel at the battery’s heart — a dark dust known as “black mass.”', 'Li-Cycle can sell these materials directly or ship the black mass to a central “hub” factory and immerse it in liquids at room temperature that Johnston says extract the metals at 90% to 95% efficiency — even lithium, which many processes struggle to capture efficiently.  ', 'The company currently has two spokes running, one in Ontario, Canada and one in Rochester, New York, which can break apart a combined 10,000 tons of lithium-ion batteries each year. Li-Cycle recently announced plans to build their first hub, also in Rochester, which will be able to separate 25,000 tons of black mass (from 65,000 tons of batteries) annually into lithium, cobalt, nickel, and other elements starting in late 2022. Like Redwood Materials, the company hopes to expand as quickly as possible, having raised about $50 million in funding so far.', '“This is a big space, and we need an army of recyclers,” Kochhar says.', 'But looking ahead, researchers note that the long-term margins of scavenging batteries for their atomic parts may prove punishingly thin. The chemical structure of batteries shifts from year to year — Panasonic slashed the cobalt content in Tesla batteries by 60% between 2012 and 2018, for instance. These changes may require continuously tweaking the recycling process while also making it less lucrative (Cobalt is the most expensive, and valuable, battery element).', 'A more efficient route may be to recycle batteries at a higher level, salvaging their larger molecular structure as opposed to their atoms. Steve Sloop, a chemist and founder of a battery research firm called OnTo Technology, likens a battery to an apartment building. Rather than knock it down for wood and brick, why not renovate? “A lot of energy is invested in making [batteries],” he says. “We’re trying to save that investment.”', 'In the case of lithium-ion batteries, that means replacing the lithium, a little bit of which gets stuck to the battery’s molecular scaffolding during every charge and discharge. When the battery runs out of freely flowing lithium, it dies. In September, Sloop published a case study describing how his lab automatically disassembled and shredded recalled Apple batteries, soaking their active materials in a lithium-rich bath to restore them to pristine condition. The final product marked the first full fuel cell re-assembled from an industrial source.', 'And OnTo Technology is just one group pursuing this “direct recycling” strategy. The Department of Energy funds a research consortium called the ReCell Center, which supports similar projects. The center is currently organizing an informal competition between several different types of “re-lithiation” to see which performs best, according to Linda Gaines, a transportation systems analyst at Argonne National Laboratory, which is leading the effort.  ', '“Re-lithiation has come a long way,” she says. “It really is at the stage where we can think about scaling up.”', 'Scaling up will be the major challenge all these initiatives face. In the lab, reducing batteries to atoms, or replacing lithium, is relatively easy. But how to collect, transport, sort, disassemble, process, and redistribute the millions of tons of materials that are coming is anything but.', '“This is a new technology that’s coming to market,” says Gavin Harper, a materials scientist at the University of Birmingham who is involved with ReLib, a UK battery recycling project. “We haven’t seen the problems and the challenges and also the opportunities that it’s going to create.”']"

Four months later, the sellers are still active and more than half of them have had new complaints about expired products, even as regulation begins to catch up.', 'Since Amazon bought Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017, it’s become an ever-bigger player in the $800 billion grocery market. It offers free 2-hour grocery delivery with Amazon Fresh and cashierless Amazon Go convenience stores in four cities. A full-size cashierless supermarket store recently opened in Seattle and another is set to open in Los Angeles this year.', 'But there’s also an entire section of food sold through Amazon’s regular e-commerce platform. It’s called Grocery & Gourmet, and it launched in 2006, selling 14,000 “dry” grocery products. Today, it has hundreds of thousands of items, sold by millions of third-party sellers.', 'The downside to the convenience created by Amazon’s huge marketplace is that some of these food items are falling through the cracks of Amazon’s strict regulations. The CNBC analysis found expired hot sauce, beef jerky, granola bars, Doritos, coffee creamer and baby food.', '3PM Solutions, a data analytics firm that specializes in e-commerce, analyzed Amazon’s 100 best-selling food products for CNBC in October. Of the sellers that had over 1,000 customer reviews in the last year, 40% had more than five customer complaints about expired goods.', 'Almost four months later, 3PM found that all these sellers are still active, and at least 50% of them have had more customer complaints of selling expired products since the initial story in October. Amazon told CNBC that this happens in very isolated incidents.', '3PM says it noticed a pattern among 150 million customer reviews of more than 2 million third-party sellers.', 'Tweet', '“When a consumer gets an expired product, it not only damages their faith in the brand and the work that the brands put into building a great product, but it also damages the consumer’s trust in Amazon,” said former Amazon product safety program manager Rachel Johnson Greer, now an Amazon Marketplace Strategist for Cascadia Seller Solutions. “So hopefully Amazon will fix this and will make it easier to find these expired products and to manage food, not only for the consumer, which they should be doing before anyway, but also for themselves and the brand.”', 'When Congress passed the Food Safety Modernization Act in 2011, Rachel Johnson Greer’s job at Amazon was to bring its food storage and handling procedures into compliance. She told CNBC she saw tubs of gummies melted together on the top shelves of warehouses that had reached 120 degrees, and instances where Tide laundry detergent was stored next to oatmeal that had absorbed the chemical smell.', 'In a statement, Amazon told CNBC that, “We work hard to provide customers with a great shopping experience, and that includes receiving products in the condition they expect and with sufficient shelf life. We require selling partners to abide by strict product quality guidelines and our teams have robust proactive systems in place to prevent expired goods from being shipped to customers.”', '“We also use a combination of artificial intelligence and manual processes to monitor over 20 million pieces of customer feedback we receive weekly for any concerns,” the Amazon spokesperson said. “If one arises, we work quickly to investigate, take the appropriate actions and use this information to improve our systems. Appropriate actions include warning, suspending or terminating a bad actor’s account. If customers have a concern with a potentially expired product, we encourage them to contact our Customer Service directly for a full refund of their purchase.”', 'This problem persists, in part, because regulation is sparse. The Food and Drug Administration told CNBC that ”’best-by” or “sell-by” dates are not required under federal law, with the exception of infant formula. The FDA calls expiration dates “manufacturer quality dates” that “are not indicative of the safety of the product.” ', 'Amazon is also regulated differently than its brick-and-mortar competitors. If a traditional grocery store sells a defective product, the store can be sued alongside the company that made the product, and that liability means conventional retailers are careful about the products they stock. But Amazon has successfully avoided liability in court by arguing it’s a platform for the sale of goods, rather than a seller.', '“Historically, courts have found that Amazon is not liable for items sold by the third party sellers on the platform. The legal theory is that Amazon was just providing the space like a flea market and the individual sellers were actually liable for the goods they sold and not Amazon,” said trademark lawyer Josh Gerben.', 'A bill introduced in the House on Monday may change this. A group of four representatives, two Republicans and two Democrats, introduced the SHOP SAFE Act, outlining a plan to create liability for online marketplaces like Amazon if they don’t have specific safeguards in place.', 'In January, the Department of Homeland Security issued a report that requires Amazon and other e-commerce platforms to turn over information about third-party sellers and warns the online platforms could face “civil fines, penalties, and injunctive actions” for selling counterfeit or pirated goods.', '“Amazon takes product safety really seriously. The problem is just how big Amazon is. And it just is really difficult to police a system that big effectively,” Greer said.', 'Watch the video to see how expired food ends up on Amazon, and what’s being done to cut back on the problem.']"
124,It’s time to stop appeasing Putin – here’s how to deter the emboldened Russian president,2018-12-01T11:00:25+0000,"['MUNICH – There are few better places in the world than here to reflect on the need to end Western appeasement of Vladimir Putin and his growing list of international crimes. The latest was last Sunday’s Russian attack on Ukrainian naval vessels in the Black Sea – and its purpose of asserting Kremlin control over its still-sovereign neighbor.', 'This Bavarian city of beer halls and baroque beauty has another claim it would rather shake, one that made its name synonymous with appeasement. On Sept. 30, 1938, when the perils posed by Adolf Hitler were already apparent, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, French Premier Edouard Daladier, and Italian leader Benito Mussolini signed the Munich Pact, which handed Nazi Germany large parts of Czechoslovakia in the name of peace.', 'There’s an unwritten rule among serious historians and journalists: No one and nothing should be compared to Hitler and the Third Reich, a singular personality and episode of evil. No direct comparison is reasonable or useful. Russians suffered more fatalities than any other people from what became known as the “Munich Betrayal” and the world war that was to come.', 'Still, there is a Munich lesson for how to respond to Putin today. Appeasement’s price is always high. It encourages malevolent actors to escalate their ambitions as they calculate what they wish to achieve against reduced risk and resistance.', 'Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008, and the de facto annexation of its two breakaway provinces, was followed by the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, the first forceful changing of European borders since World War II. Then there was Moscow’s intervening in Syria to prop up murderous dictator Bassar al Assad in 2015, which was followed by Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.', 'Western intelligence services – mostly caught by surprise by these events – have been gaming what the Russian leader might do next. It was a safe bet that it would fall within his campaigns to rebuild regional influence or to undermine the United States, its European allies, and their democracies and primary institutions, NATO and the European Union, while blocking their ability to accept new members from Moscow’s neighborhood.', 'Part of the answer came last weekend.', 'Two aspects of Russia’s military action were significant. First, it was the first time that Putin had so brazenly used his own conventional military forces against Ukraine, where he has acted mostly in the shadows or through proxies. Second, by firing upon Ukrainian vessels, he must have factored in a potential chain of events that might have led to a wider war.', 'President Donald Trump’s tweet on Thursday that he wouldn’t meet with Putin this weekend on the margins of the G-20 in Argentina was encouraging but insufficient.', 'In an interview with the German-language Bild Zeitung, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko this week warned, “The only language [Putin] understands is the solidarity of the Western world. We can’t accept Russia’s aggressive policies. First it was Crimea, then eastern Ukraine, now he wants the Sea of Azov.”', 'Here’s a brief guide to what has happened and what should be done, providing context and a range of responses recommended by Atlantic Council experts:', 'In 2003, Russia and Ukraine reached agreement on cooperation in the shared waterways of the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait, which runs between Russia and Crimea as the only entrance to the sea.', 'After Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, it used its new control of both sides of the strait to build a $3.7 billion bridge connecting Crimea to mainland Russia. Its low height of 115 feet cut off access of larger ships to the Ukrainian ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk, resulting in a sharp decline of port revenues.', 'In May of this year, following the bridge’s completion, Russia moved naval vessels, including warships from its Caspian Flotilla, to the Sea of Azov. Since then, Russia has detained some 150 Ukrainian and foreign merchant ships and interrogated their crew members, according to a Ukrainian official and port authorities, deterring more ship traffic and further cutting revenues.', 'Last Sunday, Russian forces opened fire and seized three Ukrainian naval ships after rebuffing their attempt to travel from the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov through the Kerch Strait. Russian troops detained 24 Ukrainian crew members, six of whom were injured, and have now transferred them to Moscow for criminal prosecution.', 'The United States, European allies, the European Union, and NATO have condemned the Kremlin’s aggression against Ukraine. Without more than that, however, Putin won’t be deterred.', 'Atlantic Council experts favor a three-pronged, diplomatic, economic, and military response, including but not limited to the following:', '- Diplomatically, the U.S., NATO, the EU, and other western allies should not only condemn the Russian actions but also detail how they violate specific international conventions. There should be demands that Russia apologize, punish those responsible, and immediately release the Ukrainian sailors.', 'Russia should permit Ukrainian shipping free access to the Sea of Azov, in accordance with the 2003 agreement. The NATO and EU should jointly send a fact-finding mission to the Sea of Azov.', '- Economically, the United States and Europe should more stringently enforce the already existing sanctions imposed following Russia’s annexation of Crimea, since that is the source of the problem. They should then prepare new sanctions on Russian financial institutions and shipping interests, to be implemented if Russia doesn’t reverse course.', 'To impose even greater costs, the U.S. should push Germany to suspend the ill-conceived Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea. Once operational, Nord Stream 2 — which bypasses Ukraine — will cost Ukraine a 3 percent drop in GDP. Russia’s multiple provocations undermine European efforts to obtain guarantees of continued gas transit through Ukraine after Nord Stream 2 comes on line.', '- Given the more direct Russian military involvement, it’s also time to increase surveillance and other monitoring of the Sea of Azov by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and Western drones. A stronger message would be to widen NATO and U.S. military presence in the eastern Black Sea by increasing freedom of navigation operations.', 'Finally, the U.S. and allies should provide additional defensive naval armaments to Ukraine, including coastal defense surface-to-ship missiles, patrol boats, radar, and additional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets.', 'Critics might argue that such actions would be provocative.

126,SpaceX is set to launch four nonprofessional astronauts to orbit: Here’s what you should know,2021-09-15T16:04:59+0000,"['KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. — Elon Musk’s SpaceX is set to make history with a launch of four civilians in what would be the first full crew of nonprofessional astronauts to fly to space.', 'The mission, known as Inspiration4, is scheduled to lift off Wednesday night, with a five-hour window that opens at 8:02 p.m. ET.', 'The mission is the creation of SpaceX and billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, 38-year-old founder and CEO of Shift4 Payments. Isaacman purchased the multiday flight from SpaceX for an undisclosed fee, with the goal of raising awareness and funding for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.', '“This is significant and historic because it’s going to be the highest that any humans have gone into orbit since the Hubble [Space Telescope] servicing missions,” SpaceX senior director of human spaceflight Benji Reed told reporters Tuesday. The last Hubble servicing mission was in May 2009. “Another historic part for SpaceX is that this will be the first time that we have three [Dragon capsules] in orbit.”', 'Isaacman and the Inspiration4 team have worked with SpaceX to train since announcing the flight in February. He noted that the crew on Tuesday met with company leadership — including Musk, who “gave us his assurances again that the entire leadership team is solely focused on this mission.”', 'Asked how he felt with less than 24 hours to liftoff, Isaacman said he had “no jitters, excited to get going.”', 'SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule was developed with heavy investment from NASA, which has flown 10 of its professional astronauts on the spacecraft. While the space agency has comparatively minimal involvement in the Inspiration4 launch, NASA director of commercial spaceflight Phil McAlister told CNBC that private missions were one of the goals set when contributing government funds to SpaceX’s vehicle.', '“We are seeing a sort of renaissance in commercial orbital human space transportation,” McAlister said. “For the first time in human history, you can go to a private company and purchase a ticket to orbit. You’ve never been able to do that; historically, you had to go to a government agency.”', 'One of the key factors for launching on Wednesday night remains the temperamental Florida weather, which will affect the timing of liftoff and the capsule’s splashdown a few days later.', '“We look at not only the launch weather but we have to look at the return weather,” Reed said.', 'The U.S. Space Force’s 45th Space Wing forecast that the weather has a 80% probability of being clear to launch during Wednesday’s five-hour window. If SpaceX decides to postpone the launch, the next available opportunity would be Thursday.', 'SpaceX will broadcast steady live coverage of the launch, from four hours before liftoff to until the spacecraft reaches orbit.', 'Isaacman gathered a unique group of individuals for the mission through three ways: from St. Jude’s staff, through an entrepreneurial competition, and via a charity lottery.', 'Isaacman, the Inspiration4 commander, founded his payment processing company in 1999 when he was 16. He’s also an avid pilot, with a variety of ratings in commercial and military jets. He has flown in more than 100 airshows and is co-founder of Draken International, a private aerospace company that helps train pilots for the U.S. military.', 'Hayley Arceneaux, a cancer survivor and now a physician assistant at St. Jude, is the mission’s medical officer.', 'She survived osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, at age 10 and will be the first person to fly in space with a prosthetic body part — as a significant portion of her leg is metal. At 29, Arceneaux will also become the youngest American to fly in space.', '“From a medical officer perspective, I’m so excited about the medical research that we’re going to be doing — we’re going to be collecting a lot of swabs to learn about the microbiome, how that changes in flight; we’re going to be performing ultrasounds to evaluate for fluid shifts; as well as performance and cognitive tests and studying radiation effects of going to our high altitude,” Arceneaux told reporters.', 'Sian Proctor, 51, the Inspiration4 pilot, joined the crew after winning an online business competition through Isaacman’s company.', 'She is a geoscientist and science communication specialist, with a passion for space exploration that extends back to her childhood: She was born in Guam while her father worked for a NASA ground station during the Apollo missions. Proctor is an analog astronaut, having completed multiple Earth-based missions that simulate the isolation of living in space. In 2009, Proctor was a finalist for NASA’s 2009 astronaut selection.', '“It’s really special for me to hold that title [of pilot] because I’m going to be the first Black female pilot of a spacecraft,” Proctor told reporters. “There have been three Black female astronauts that have made it to space, and knowing that I’m going to be the fourth means that I have this opportunity to not only accomplish my dream, but also inspire the next generation of women of color and girls of color and really get them to think about reaching for the stars.”', 'The fourth member of the crew is mission specialist Chris Sembroski, who donated to the St. Jude fundraising campaign and was selected from among nearly 72,000 entries.', 'Sembroski, 42, is an Air Force veteran who served in Iraq.', '“I’ve been just thinking about how lucky I am to be a part of this crew, to be a part of this mission. From watching a Super Bowl commercial and making a donation, to not winning that and then having my friend win it, and then through his generosity give that spot to me, I think that just really puts me in a very special spot,” Sembroski said. “Not only do I feel very lucky to be here, but I have a huge responsibility to pay that forward and show that generosity toward others.”', 'The four crew members have spent much of the last six months training with SpaceX to prepare for the mission. Reed noted that the Inspiration4 members studied over 90 training guides, took a multitude of lessons to learn how to fly the spacecraft, and did numerous simulation flights — including 12- and 30-hour simulations.', 'Isaacman also said the crew has “been tearing up the skies in some fighter jets” during training and prep, “which I put at relatively higher risk than this mission, so that we’re nice and comfortable as we get strapped into Falcon.”', 'Proctor praised SpaceX’s training process.', '“Since the announcement, when we were here [at Kennedy Space Center] last, every day has been the best day of my life and it’s only getting better,” Proctor said.', 'The primary goal of Inspiration4 is to raise funds and awareness for St. Jude. The Inspiration4 team aims to raise $200 million for the research hospital. Just over $30 million has been donated to date, with another $100 million coming from Isaacman.', 'SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule will fly to an orbital altitude of about 575 kilometers, where the Inspiration4 crew will float for about three days before reentering the atmosphere and splashing down on either the Gulf Coast or the Atlantic Coast of Florida.', 'Four hours before liftoff, the astronauts will suit up. About a half an hour later, they will walk out to their Tesla Model X rides, which will drive from the NASA astronaut quarters to the launchpad.', 'With 2½ hours to go, the astronauts will strap into their seats in Crew Dragon and begin checking that all systems are good to go. Then, with just under two hours until launch, the hatch to the spacecraft will be closed. ', 'SpaceX will begin loading the rocket with fuel 35 minutes before launch, which will initiate a final series of processes and checks.', 'A few minutes after liftoff, the Falcon 9′s booster stage will return and attempt to land on the company’s barge stationed in the Atlantic.', 'If anything were to go wrong in the last half hour before the launch or during the launch, Crew Dragon will abort and fire its emergency escape system. The company performed a full test of that system in January 2020 with no one inside the spacecraft. That test saw SpaceX trigger the system during the most intense part of the launch to show that it could be done at any time.', 'While NASA’s role in the mission is minimal compared with astronaut launches to the International Space Station, the agency is still involved. NASA is supporting Inspiration4 on a fully reimbursable basis under agreements with SpaceX, with the services in total worth about $1 million.', '“We are providing some services and some equipment, that just make more sense for NASA to provide,” McAlister said.', 'Reed thanked NASA for its partnership with SpaceX, as the agency was heavily involved in the development of the company’s Crew Dragon capsule.', 'SpaceX developed its Crew Dragon spacecraft and fine-tuned its Falcon 9 rocket under NASA’s Commercial Crew program, which provided the company with $3.1 billion to develop the system and launch six operational missions. Commercial Crew is a competitive program, as NASA also awarded Boeing with $4.8 billion in contracts to develop its Starliner spacecraft — but that competing capsule remains in development due to an uncrewed flight test that experienced significant challenges nearly two years ago.', 'Crew Dragon is the SpaceX capsule that will transport the passengers, with this specific spacecraft being dubbed “Resilience” by prior NASA astronauts. It is an evolved version of the company’s Cargo Dragon spacecraft, which has launched to the space station more than 20 times. Just as Cargo Dragon was the first privately developed spacecraft to bring supplies to the ISS, so Crew Dragon is the first privately developed spacecraft to transport people. ', 'NASA is now benefiting from its investment in Crew Dragon, which the agency certified for operational use last November.', '“This is the culmination of what we envisioned for the Commercial Crew Program 10 years ago,” McAlister said. “It’s actually in the original charter for the program, that the objective of what we were trying to accomplish was to achieve a system capable of crew transportation to the International Space Station, but also to enable a commercial capability for other customers.”', '“The program wouldn’t be fully successful, unless we had these kinds of missions [like Inspiration4],” McAlister said.', 'Crew Dragon with its trunk stands just under 27 feet tall and 13 feet around. The spacecraft includes its own system of small rocket engines for directional control in space and a launch abort system in the event of an emergency. Its trunk is the large lower half that’s covered in solar panels, which can carry cargo.', 'The spacecraft is designed to carry as many as seven people. Its control system is focused on touch screens, although NASA notes that Crew Dragon has a “robust fault tolerance built into the system.” With the astronauts wearing custom SpaceX spacesuits, the touch screens work whether or not the astronauts are wearing gloves. The spacesuits are largely designed to protect the astronauts in the event that the spacecraft loses pressurization, with life support and power systems connected through a point on the spacesuit’s leg.', 'SpaceX made one major change to Resilience, which was to add a “cupola” window in place of the spacecraft’s docking adapter in the nose cone.', 'Reed noted that SpaceX’s manifest of Crew Dragon missions “is getting busier by the minute,” with a growing backlog of private trips planned. He said SpaceX is “gearing up to be able to fly” three to six times a year.', 'Musk’s company has announced several private missions already, including a deal with Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa to fly on the company’s Starship rocket on a trip around the moon in 2023. SpaceX also has space tourism deals with Axiom Space, which aims to fly four people to the International Space Station on a 10-day trip early next year, and Space Adventures, which plans to fly four tourists on a five-day “free-flyer” trip to orbit by 2022.', 'SpaceX’s Falcon 9 is the workhorse of the company’s growing fleet of rockets. It stands at nearly 230 feet tall and is capable of launching as much as 25 tons to low Earth orbit. ', 'A few days before the Inspiration4 launch, SpaceX performed a static fire test of the full Falcon 9 rocket on the launch pad.', 'Crew Dragon sits in place of the rocket’s nose cone at the top. After launching the spacecraft on its way, the large lower portion of Falcon 9, known as the “booster,” will reenter the Earth’s atmosphere and attempt to land on the company’s drone ship in the ocean. SpaceX has landed its Falcon 9 rocket boosters 84 times.']"

The two Asian firms combined control more than 70% of the semiconductor manufacturing market.', 'The U.S., which was once a leader, lags behind in this space after monumental shifts in the business models in the semiconductor industry.', 'But a global semiconductor shortage and geopolitical tensions with China have bolstered Washington’s scrutiny of the supply chain, which is concentrated in the hands of a small number of players, and has created a drive to bring manufacturing back to American soil to regain leadership.', 'The U.S. has earmarked billions of dollars and is reportedly looking at alliances with other nations.', 'Semiconductors are critical to everything from cars to the smartphones we use. And they have also been thrust into the center of U.S.-China tensions.', '“One characteristic of US policy is that it has heavy emphasis on China. This has now become a national imperative to enhance self-sufficiency in semis production, accelerated by the recent chip shortages and the ‘tech war’ against China,” Bank of America said in a note published Wednesday.', 'The key to understanding the geopolitics of semiconductors, which countries dominate and why the U.S. is trying to boost its domestic industry, lies in coming to grips with the supply chain and business models.', 'Companies like Intel are integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), which design and manufacture their own chips.', 'Then there are the fabless semiconductor firms, which design chips but outsource manufacturing to so-called foundries. The two biggest foundries are TSMC in Taiwan and Samsung Electronics in South Korea.', 'Over the last 15 years or so, companies began shifting to this fabless model. TSMC and Samsung took advantage as they began to invest heavily in leading-edge manufacturing technology. Now if a company like Apple wants to get the latest chip for their iPhone produced, they have to turn to TSMC to do it.', 'TSMC has 55% foundry market share and Samsung has 18%, according to data from Trendforce. Taiwan and South Korea collectively have 81% of the global market in foundries, highlighting the dominance and reliance on these two countries as well as on TSMC and Samsung.', '“In 2001, 30 companies manufactured at the leading edge however as semi manufacturing grew in cost and difficulty, this number has fallen to just 3 firms” — TSMC, Intel and Samsung, according to a note from Bank of America published in December.', 'However, Intel’s manufacturing process is still behind that of TSMC and Samsung.', '“Taiwan and South Korea have become leaders in wafer fabrication which requires massive capital investment; and part of their success over the last 20 years is due to supportive government policies and access to skilled labour forces,” Neil Campling, head of technology, media and telecoms research at Mirabaud Securities, told CNBC by email.', 'While TSMC and Samsung are the dominant manufacturers of semiconductors, they still rely heavily on equipment and machinery from the U.S., Europe and Japan.', 'The companies that make these tools required by foundries are known as semiconductor capital equipment vendors or “semicap” for short.', 'The top five semicap equipment vendors make up nearly 70% of the market, according to Bank of America, citing Gartner data. Three of the five are U.S. companies, one is European and one is Japanese.', 'Netherlands-based ASML is the only company in the world that can make so-called extreme ultraviolet (EUV), which is required to make the most advanced chips such as those manufactured by TSMC and Samsung.', 'So, the U.S. is not necessarily falling behind in the semiconductor industry as a whole. Some of its firms are integral to the supply chain. But one area it has lagged in is manufacturing.', 'Under President Joe Biden, the U.S. is looking to regain leadership in manufacturing and secure supply chains.', 'In February, Biden signed an executive order which involves a review of the semiconductor supply chain to identify risks. As part of a $2 trillion economic stimulus package, $50 billion was earmarked for semiconductor manufacturing and research. A bill known as the CHIPS for America Act is also working its way through the legislative process and aims to provide incentives to enable advanced research and development and secure the supply chain.', 'Meanwhile, U.S. firm Intel last month announced plans to spend $20 billion to build two new chip factories and said it will act as a foundry. This could offer a domestic alternative to the likes of TSMC and Samsung.', 'Part of that scrutiny on the supply chain has been prompted by a global chip shortage that’s hit the automotive industry. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated demand for personal electronics like laptops and games consoles just as industrials and automakers wound down production. But a rebound in production plus heightened demand for chips in various sectors has triggered a shortage.', 'The concentration of production in the hands of TSMC and Samsung has worsened the problem.', 'The semiconductor supply shortage “has probably made the U.S. administration realise they aren’t in control of their own destiny,” according to Mirabaud Securities’ Campling.', 'But there are also geopolitical factors at play, informing U.S. policy.', '“Over the longer-term, the Biden administration wants to continue to encourage both foreign and U.S. semiconductor manufacturers to expand capacity in the U.S., to reduce dependence on manufacturing in geopolitically sensitive areas such as Taiwan, and create high paying engineering jobs in the U.S.,” Paul Triolo, head of the geo-technology practice at Eurasia Group, told CNBC by email.', 'Part of the U.S. policy in the semiconductor space involves forming alliances. Earlier this month, the Nikkei reported that the U.S. and Japan will cooperate on supply chains for critical components like semiconductors. The two sides will aim for a system where production is not concentrated on specific regions like Taiwan, the Nikkei said.', '“The U.S. is trying to cut China out of the equation,” Abishur Prakash, a geopolitical specialist at the Center for Innovating the Future, a Toronto-based consulting firm, told CNBC via email.', '“It is trying to redesign how the world’s chip industry works in the face of a rising China. This is not necessarily about self-sufficiency, although Washington would welcome this. Instead, it is about building up critical sectors — from AI to chips — that are insulated from geopolitics. And, because several nations share U.S. concerns about China, the U.S. is taking a chunk of the world with it.”', 'China meanwhile is trying to push self-sufficiency amid U.S. moves to cut it off from key supplies. Over the past few years, China has tried to boost its semiconductor industry through huge investments and incentives like tax breaks.', 'But China remains well behind everywhere else and that goes back to the supply chain. SMIC is China’s largest foundry, a competitor to the likes of TSMC and Samsung. But SMIC’s technology is several years behind that of its Taiwan and South Korean rivals.', 'And even if it wanted to advance, it’s extremely difficult due to U.S. sanctions and actions. Washington put SMIC on a blacklist known as the Entity List last year. That restricts American companies from exporting certain technology to SMIC, holding back the chipmaker due to the key role U.S. firms play in the semiconductor supply chain. Roughly 80% or more of SMIC equipment comes from U.S. vendors, according to Bank of America.', 'Last year, Reuters reported that the U.S. pressured the Netherlands government to stop the sale of an ASML machine to SMIC. The Dutch firm is the only company that makes the so-called extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machine that is needed to make the most cutting-edge chips. That machine has still not been shipped to China.', '“If China wants to manufacture leading edge chips, it is virtually impossible without equipment from the US or allies,” Bank of America said in its December note.', '“We remain skeptical about a meaningful progress in China’s progress due to US restrictions as it is materially behind in IP (intellectual property) and has limited access to IP given the US restrictions,” Bank of America said in a separate note last week.', '“Our team expects a delay of around 5+ years before it makes a more significant progress.”']"
130,Canada’s PM Trudeau is facing a national energy crisis that’s at the tipping point,2019-03-12T12:30:17+0000,"['Far north of Texas, another great North American oil reserve sits, waiting — some say — to be further exploited. The province of Alberta is Canada’s main oil producer: 97 percent of the country’s proven reserves — 166.3 billion barrels — can be found in its oil sands. The reserve, buried beneath a layer of muskeg and forest in the northeastern part of the province, holds a reservoir of heavy crude oil known as bitumen, mixed with sand, clay and water. That oil is recovered by either mining or drilling: Both methods are more expensive than the means used to recover conventional oil reserves.', 'The Alberta oil sands already produce 3.6 million barrels of oil per day, and plans are to increase that to 3.9 million by 2027, but the province is facing a problem of oversupply. The infrastructure is in place to produce the oil, but the oil sands only have access to the North American market via crude-by-rail. The price differential between the unrefined bitumen produced in Canada and what American refineries can get for the synthetic crude they make out of it isn’t favorable to the Canadian market.', 'The bottom line: “Low oil prices have put the Alberta economy in crisis,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the Chamber of Commerce in November.', 'Difficulties attracting investment and the price gap, which reached a record low late last year, are stymying efforts to ramp up production and boost exports beyond North America to lucrative markets in Asia.', 'A second oil pipeline that would run through neighboring British Columbia to the west coast could solve that problem and get the oil revenue-dependent province back on track. That’s what the convoy that arrived in the Canadian capital two weeks ago drove 2,000 miles to demand from the federal government.', 'The United We Roll truckers’ convoy numbered around 170 vehicles when it left Red Deer, Alberta. The motley band of semis, pickup trucks and cars driven by Alberta oil workers and supporters they picked up along the way arrived in Ottawa a few days later and staged several peaceful protests before departing.', '“Alberta’s hurting. We’re hurting for jobs, and it shows,” convoy member Mike Jepson told the CBC. Alberta’s economy is heavily dependent on oil, and a spike or drop in the price of oil results in thousands of job losses, both in the oil sector and elsewhere. As of January 2019, unemployment in the province sits at 6.8 percent. The province’s leadership, under Premier Rachel Notley, has been criticized for failing to prioritize diversifying the economy to provide some protection from volatile oil prices.', 'The convoy members think that building the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion (TMX) is key to Canada’s future economic competitiveness. Notley and Trudeau, her federal counterpart, have both said the same. But others say that making large capital investments in oil production is shortsighted. “It’s sad for anyone looking at Alberta to see how long it’s not been diversifying,” said McGill University economist Chris Barrington-Leigh.', 'One thing is certain: The province can’t continue as it is now.', 'The TMX would follow the path of the existing Trans Mountain Pipeline, increasing throughput from 300 barrels per day to 890,000. It would cross British Columbia and travel almost 700 miles to terminate at a shipping site in Vancouver, as CNBC reported in June 2018. At that time, the federal government purchased the project at a cost of $4.5 billion CAD from Kinder Morgan Canada in June 2018. The costs of building the TMX are estimated to be $7.4 billion CAD, money that Ottawa is seeking from private backers. No backers for the project have yet emerged.', 'Kinder Morgan backed out of the pipeline venture because it was too risky. Vocal protests in British Columbia and a series of court challenges have delayed and complicated the project.', 'The protests surround the possible environmental impacts of the pipeline — everything from oil spills to the impact of increased shipping on the resident killer whales — to questions over indigenous sovereignty.', '“Most land in British Columbia is unceded,” said Simon Fraser University marine ecologist Anne Salomon. That means British Columbia’s indigenous peoples, who didn’t sign historical treaties, “have constitutionally protected rights to engage in decisions about their territories and resources,” she said. The courts supported those rights in a 2018 decision that represented another setback for the TMX project.', 'The federal government remains committed to the pipeline. A new round of First Nations consultations is currently playing out, while the National Energy Board returned an environmentally-minded “Reconsideration Report” on Feb. 22 that supported the pipeline.', '“I think there’s lots of both political capital and actual capital at stake here,” said Jackie Forrest of the ARC Energy Research Institute, “and a lot of incentive for them to see the project through.”', 'The pipeline saga is connected to a hard turn to the right in mainstream Canadian politics. The United We Roll protests framed themselves as being under the same banner as France’s Yellow Vest movement, although protesting a national carbon tax rather than diesel pricing.', 'But over the course of their eastward trip, it became clear that the intent of the movement’s supporters was more diffuse. Politically extreme viewpoints, including racist and anti-immigration messaging, became linked with the convoy.', '“This anticarbon tax, anti-immigration, openly racist right wing movement is showing the world that Canada is not immune to this tide of far right politics,” said University of Saskatchewan political scientist Charles Smith. United We Roll shows that this far right movement is materially tied to Canada’s oil sector, he said.', 'In the short term a pipeline could attract investment capital to the oil sands, but it wouldn’t necessarily represent a change in oil sands output right away. Forrest said the growth outlook would likely be similar to what’s currently expected over the next four to five years, because of existing investments. Widely cited estimates from the Conference Board of Canada, a think tank, place the value of the pipeline at $18.5 billion in revenue for provincial and federal governments over the 20-year period.', 'But the pipeline may prove to be a bad investment, say experts. “These are damned expensive pieces of capital to put into play,” said University of Wyoming oil economist Charles Mason.', 'Right now Canada is the world’s fifth-largest crude oil producer. Ninety-nine percent of its crude oil exports go to the United States. The existing market for Canadian crude oil is likely to change because of the U.S. energy renaissance, he said. Currently, American refineries are configured to optimally handle heavier crude, such as that which comes from Canada and Venezuela.', 'But in-country oil production in North Dakota and the Permian Basin is likely to change the focus of investment toward processing for the “light, tight” crude oil that’s produced in-country via hydraulic fracturing. This leads him to think demand for heavy crude from Canada and Venezuela will shrink over the next 20 years.', 'That’s an argument for Canada developing alternative markets in places like Asia. But Mason also questions if predictions for those markets are overly optimistic.', 'Other future costs are more difficult to quantify, but easier — at this late date — to predict. “If you take into account the social costs of releasing fossil fuels, there’s no way it’s economical [to build the Trans Mountain pipeline],” said McGill University’s economist Barrington-Leigh.', 'Those costs could come home to roost in the form of a much feared oil spill on the coast. Tanker traffic will more than double because of increased throughput. There still isn’t full understanding of the potential impacts of an oil spill, said Salomon, and proponents of the TMX, including Forrest, say that everything possible will be done to mitigate that possibility.', 'But an oil spill isn’t the only threat to coastal ecosystems, which the City of Vancouver directly links to more than 300,000 jobs in every field from tourism to fishing. The financial impact of burning fossil fuels themselves, though “often not accounted for in tradeoff analyses,” needs to be taken into consideration on an infrastructure project such as this one, Salomon said.', 'Warming and acidifying oceans — consequences of climate change, which is directly linked to burning fossil fuels — impact Canada’s fisheries, she said. For some species fished in Canada, like the Pacific herring and the Atlantic cod, impact estimates are as high as 30 percent to 60 percent stock loss in the next 50 years.', 'The Stockholm Environment Institute estimates expanding Canadian oil sands production “could increase global emissions by 50 million to 150 million tons of CO2 annually by 2030.” Currently, oil sands production accounts for about one quarter of the country’s greenhouse-gas emissions each year.', '2030 is the same year by which the 2018 International Panel on Climate Change report warns warming could exceed the crucial 1.5 degree Celsius threshold, leading to devastating environmental and human consequences. If a pipeline is built, which will ramp up production over the longer term, it will be next to impossible for Canada to meet its Paris Climate Agreement commitments and help keep warming below this level, Barrington-Leigh said.', 'Expanding oil sands production in Canada could also drive down global oil prices in the long term, the institute said. Current predictions of a global slowdown in demand could lead to a global oversupply crisis. It’s already true that demand trends in developed nations are steady or downward, Forrest said: Developing nation markets are where demand is on the rise.', 'Barrington-Leigh sees another path forward. Years of an oil boom have left Alberta in a great position to innovate, he said. Oil proponents like Forrest say that innovation could be channeled into making the oil sands greener — and the financial boost afforded by a pipeline and access to the Asian markets could fund that innovation. But more focus on oil is just the Dutch disease, Barrington-Leigh said.', 'The problem for the private sector remains uncertain. With a pipeline project surrounded by a complicated web of intergovernmental conflict and no clear federal leadership on a way forward that creates jobs for Albertans while also helping to diversify the province’s economy, Barrington-Leigh said there’s no way to attract investment.', 'For now, political tensions over this issue keep rising during Alberta’s provincial election and Canada’s federal election year.']"

The new strain of virus, called COVID-19, has killed more than 1,300 people, mostly in China, and infected over 64,000 people worldwide.', 'India reported three confirmed cases in the state of Kerala, out of more than 1,700 people tested around the country as of Thursday, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research. That included 654 people evacuated from Wuhan, all of whom had tested negative.', '“We started taking action on this in the middle of January, at least two weeks before the World Health Organization declared it as an emergency of international concern,” Vardhan told CNBC’s “Street Signs.”', 'Those measures include thermal screening for passengers coming from mainland China, Thailand, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea at airports and seaports, taking down their detailed history and then sharing that information with state-level and district-level surveillance officers to keep tabs on them through an integrated disease surveillance program, the health minister explained. More than 2,000 flights have been screened, he said.', '“We’ve got very good coordination with all our state governments. The whole issue is being monitored at the highest level in the country and also with the state governments,” Vardhan said. ', 'He said some 15,000 people have been “kept under watch as a matter of abundant precaution,” and those showing early symptoms were being kept in isolation at hospitals.', 'India also set up 15 laboratories to test for the virus, and Vardhan said the country has the potential to build up to 50 labs if the need arises. New Delhi has also issued travel advisories, telling people to refrain from traveling to China. The minister also said existing visas — including already issued electronic visas — for foreign nationals traveling to India from China are no longer valid and that screenings were also being conducted at the border.', '“Every concerned ministry is actively involved in ensuring that we plug every possible loophole, which can allow the entry of the virus in a big way in the country,” Vardhan said. “We are sure that (if) we could handle Ebola in 2014, (if) we could handle other diseases, we can handle this coronavirus quite well.”', 'Local airlines, including national carrier Air India, have also temporarily canceled flights to China.', 'Two Indian nationals on board a cruise ship in Japan also contracted the pneumonia-like virus, the Indian embassy in Tokyo confirmed on Wednesday. Both of them worked as crew members aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship that is currently quarantined off the coast of Yokohama and were receiving treatment in Japanese hospitals along with other infected individuals.', 'Six passengers and 132 crew members aboard the ship were Indian nationals and the embassy said it was working with local authorities over potentially early disembarkation for those who tested negative for the virus. Indian media reported some crew members had posted a video on social media requesting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to bring them back.', 'Vardhan said that as soon as the quarantine period is over next week, India will work with Japan to make “adequate arrangements” to bring those people back to the country.', 'The cruise ship, operated by Carnival’s Princess Cruises and carrying more than 3,700 passengers and crew, has been quarantined in Japan since early February after a previous guest tested positive for the disease six days after disembarking.', 'While the economic impact in China and others, at least for the current quarter, is expected to be significant, economists have said that India would be less affected.', 'ANZ economists said in a recent note that’s likely due to the relatively small percentage of Chinese tourist arrivals to the country as well as a small share of Indian exports that go to China.', '“However, India’s imports from China are close to 14% and delays in shipments can have a bearing on economic activity in the former,” the economists said.']"

UPS said it initially plans to use them in smaller markets and create a series of short routes or one long route to meet customer needs.

The company will operate the eVTOLs under its Flight Forward division, which is also exploring drone delivery.', 'The new type of aircraft, which looks like a cross between a plane and a helicopter, “unlocks new business models that don’t exist today,” Bala Ganesh, vice president of the UPS Advanced Technology Group, told CNBC. “For example, you can see a future where it’s carrying, let’s say 1,000 pounds, 1,500 pounds to rural hospitals,” and landing on a helipad instead of an airport.', 'Vermont-based Beta Technologies will design and build the eVTOLs, which are set to be delivered to UPS in 2024, pending certification from the Federal Aviation Administration. Beta will also provide landing pads and rechargeable batteries. UPS holds an option to purchase up to 150 more eVTOLs. The price of the transaction was not disclosed. The eVTOLs can fly up to 250 miles at 170 mph on a single charge.', '“We’ve also thought about for some urgent moments, like for example bypass New York traffic, and then move it into directly to our 43rd Street building so that we can get around congestion,” Ganesh said. “It’s not going be a fit for all the packages but for certain use cases: Willingness to pay, and urgency, we could potentially think about going into those areas.”', 'The eVTOLs would be used similarly to small fixed-wing aircraft that have a capacity of 500 to 3,000 pounds. UPS said it initially plans to use them in smaller markets and create a series of short routes or one long route to meet customer needs. The eVTOLs will have an operation advantage over small planes, according to Ganesh, because they’re designed to accommodate shipping containers, which allow for faster movement of packages in many cases.', '“The smaller aircraft typically are not containerized. They don’t have any kind of container, so it’s loading a package into these aircraft, then its lands, and then has to be unloaded loaded into a truck or another vehicle and then driven to another location, resorted again, reloaded into the package car that delivers it, ” Ganesh said.', 'Beta Technologies founder Kyle Clark said his team has worked with UPS to help transform how the company handles moving packages.', '“We’re combining simple, elegant design and advanced technology to create a reliable aircraft with zero operational emissions that will revolutionize how cargo moves,” Clark said in a statement. “By utilizing vertical takeoffs and landings, we can turn relatively small spaces at existing UPS facilities into a micro air feeder network without the noise or operating emissions of traditional aircraft.”', 'Sustainability has become increasingly important since Carol Tome became CEO of UPS last June. In its 2020 annual report, UPS said its goal is to reduce greenhouse gases from its ground business by 12% and source 25% of its electric needs from renewable sources by 2025.', 'UPS announced in January 2020 a commitment to purchase up to 10,000 electric vehicles from Arrival Group, which is headquartered in London and Charlotte, North Carolina.

Some, made with phosphonates, even contribute to algal blooms. “It was shocking to learn these chemicals are not the cleanest, because they end up in our water supply. We wanted to make those safer and cheaper at the same time,” he said.', 'Solugen introduced its BioChelate water treatment made from simple sugar — a dark brown liquid that Hunt keeps in a vial on his desk — in 2020. It now sells BioChelate to a network of water treatment service providers who haul and pump it into to their customers’ pipes and water systems, while monitoring their water quality to keep it clean.', '“If you use our chemistry, you protect the inner linings of water infrastructure,” Hunt said. “This keeps your pipes from rusting and corroding, from getting blocked up with lime, or letting biofilms like legionella live in the water. All of this prevents the pipes from having bursts and catastrophic leaks. It works on anything that is a metal surface.”', 'Investors love the fact that Solugen is already operational, not just making forward-looking statements about how they’ll save the planet, said Seth Bannon, founding partner of early investor Fifty Years, which also participated in this funding round.', '“Solugen is the first synthetic biology company with a demonstrated ability to scale both their sales and their own manufacturing,” he said, contrasting it with Zymergen, whose stock recently cratered nearly 70% when the company disclosed it was having trouble scaling its manufacturing and expanding sales.

They essentially look the same as their predecessors.', 'What’s new this time is the chip that runs them. Now they’re powered by Apple’s M1 chip instead of Intel processors. Tuesday’s announcement marks the end of a 15-year run where Intel processors powered Apple’s laptops and desktops, and a big shift for the semiconductor industry.', 'Apple is the fourth-largest PC maker measured by shipments, according to a Gartner estimate, so its plan to use its own chips in its entire lineup of laptops and desktops, first announced in June, is a blow for Intel.', '“We believe Intel-powered PCs—like those based on 11th Gen Intel Core mobile processors—provide global customers the best experience in the areas they value most, as well as the most open platform for developers,” Intel said in a statement.', 'Apple’s chips are based on ARM technology, as opposed to the x86 architecture that Intel’s chips use. ARM was originally designed for mobile devices, and chips built with ARM designs are consistently more efficient, leading to longer battery life. On a laptop, that could mean several extra hours away from the plug.', 'But that’s only one reason why Apple is switching out the brains of its laptops. Here’s a rundown of why Apple made the move:', 'Apple’s strategy of owning core technologies. Apple CEO Tim Cook has frequently said that the company has a “long-term strategy of owning and controlling the primary technologies behind the products we make.”', 'For a computer hardware company, there are few technologies less essential than the silicon processors that the machines run on.', 'Apple has invested heavily in its silicon department, including major purchases, starting with a $278 million purchase of P. A. Semi in 2008, which started the department, and most recently, $1 billion for part of Intel’s modem business in 2019. It’s been building its own A-series chips for iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches since 2010. Now it’s essentially bringing the same technology to laptops and desktops, meaning that all Apple computers basically run on the same framework.', '“Apple Silicon is totally in keeping with the strategic goal of Apple to really control an entire stack,” CCS Insight research director Wayne Lam said. “Now in computing, they own everything from silicon to the software to how the user moves the mouse around, so it’s tremendously integrated.”', 'Controlling its own technologies helps Apple integrate its products more deeply. It also means that it runs its own schedule — chips take 3 years to develop, Apple senior vice president Johny Srouji said last year — and has more control over costs.', '“Apple thinks they can innovate faster than the standard business model of Intel or Qualcomm doing the development on chips and then they build on top of it,” Lam said.', 'Intel is falling behind in manufacturing. Apple proudly said on Tuesday that the M1 chip in the new Macs uses 5-nanometer transistors.', '“Five-nanometer is the leading edge of process technology right now and there are only a few products out at this point,” Gartner research director Jon Erensen said. Currently, Intel is shipping chips with 10-nanometer transistors.', 'In general, the more transistors a chipmaker can fit into the same space, the more efficient the chip is. Currently, Intel ships chips only with 10-nanometer transistors.', 'Intel famously controls its own factories, called “fabs,” around the world, compared to Apple, which contracts with companies in Asia to manufacture chips to its own specifications. But Apple’s chip manufacturing partner, TSMC, can make 5-nanometer chips while Intel can’t.', '“Intel’s had some challenges over the last couple of years on the manufacturing side. And I think those challenges have opened a window or opportunity for ARM-based designs for come in. Apple is one of the the best ARM-based processor designers out there,”  Erensen said.', 'Earlier this year, Intel CEO Bob Swan said that it was considering outsourcing its manufacturing, like what Apple does.', '“With the challenges that Intel has had moving to 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer while foundries like TSMC and Samsung have pushed more aggressively, it’s taken one of Intel’s key advantages and leveled the playing field a bit,” Erensen said.', 'More battery life, potentially better performance, and laptops that work like phones. Apple says that the M1 Macs are better products than the older models, mainly because Apple claims its chips enbable better performance and longer battery life than it could achieve using Intel’s chips.', 'It’s clear that the new Macs will have improved battery life. Apple’s previous chips have been used in smartphones and tablets, which have significantly smaller batteries.', 'During Apple’s launch event on Tuesday, the company emphasized how it mainly evaluates chips on performance per watt, not raw performance.', 'On the entry-level MacBook Air, Apple says that it can manage 15 hours of web browsing on one charge, nearly 30% more than the advertised 10 to 11 hour battery life of the previous Intel-based model.', 'The new Macs also work more like phones or tablets, Apple said, with features like the ability to wake up from sleep instantly. The new M1 Macs can even run iPhone apps, if the developer takes a few steps to make them available on Apple’s App Store.', 'However, analysts warn that Apple’s performance claims, like that it is faster than comparable PCs, will need to be tested once the computers hit shelves next week.', '“Performance of the new M1 chip is nearly impossible to gauge as the company didn’t provide any detailed substantiation around any of the performance claims made,” Moor Insights founder Patrick Moorhead said.', 'Apple did not stop selling Intel laptops on Tuesday, and its highest-end laptops are still Intel-based, suggesting that there are still performance advantages to some Intel chips.']"

The Swedish retailer joined the likes of Nike, Birkenstock and PopSockets, which decided selling on Amazon wasn’t worth the hassle, and opted to pull out instead.', 'The moves have sparked fears that Amazon will soon see more big brands flee the site. Even if brands end their relationship with Amazon, shoppers can still purchase their products on the site via third-party sellers. And unless companies can develop an e-commerce strategy to compete with Amazon’s customer-obsessed mindset, experts say ditching Amazon has the potential to backfire.', 'Amazon continues to dominate online shopping. It controls 38% of the e-commerce market in the U.S., far ahead of rivals like eBay and Walmart, which only claim single-digit percentages, according to eMarketer.', 'Brands that attempt to replicate the services they lost by ditching Amazon may find it impossible. Amazon’s logistics and shipping operations, site traffic and mountains of shopper data are hard to match, even if you’re a well-known brand like Ikea.', 'And yet, that hasn’t stopped Ikea from venturing out on its own. Ikea told CNBC in a statement that it’s moving away from Amazon as the company is “keen on exploring new areas” to reach consumers.', '“Ikea worked on a pilot project with Amazon in the U.S. for Smart Lighting in 2018. The project was a trial and after it ended, it did not go live,” the company said. “We will continue to dialogue with different partners to test new ways to meet our customers now and in the future, whenever and wherever they want.”', 'Several days after this article was published, an Ikea spokesperson shared a new statement with CNBC, noting that the company continues to work with Amazon on smart home projects: ', '“We are curious and keen on exploring new areas to get insights on how to reach and serve more of the many people,” the new statement said. “Ikea explored the possibilities to launch a pilot with Amazon in the U.S. but cancelled the project before the launch. Approximately 30 products were in the scope of the project and the plan was to run the pilot for a limited time. The project was cancelled as Ikea was not ready for [third-party] retail testing at that time. Amazon and IKEA are collaborating in the area of the smart home and will continue to work closely together on assuring compatibility within our product range.”', 'Among the strategies it has considered are developing its own marketplace that would function similar to Amazon’s, according to the Financial Times. Ikea declined to comment on its plans to launch an online platform.', 'Amazon’s marketplace is the company’s not-so-secret weapon that prevents it from relying on brands to fill the site with products. Even if a first-party vendor decides to leave the site, their product is probably still available on Amazon, by way of a third-party merchant, said James Thomson, a former Amazon manager and now partner at brand consultancy Buy Box Experts.', 'For example, a quick scan of Ikea products available on Amazon shows that there are often several third-party sellers for a single listing that offer the item at a similar price to the brand and with Prime shipping. For many Amazon shoppers, that’s likely a good enough reason not to look elsewhere.', '“To say the brand has won by walking away, they haven’t won at all,” Thomson said. “Amazon has a massive security blanket called the third-party marketplace. Those products sell at huge volumes, they’re Prime eligible and most customers don’t know any better.”', 'To be sure, Amazon’s marketplace is not without its problems. The marketplace, which now accounts for more than half of Amazon’s overall sales, has also been proven to host counterfeit, unsafe and even expired goods.

PopSockets, which sells grips that attach to the back of cellphones, still has some products available on the site, the Amazon spokesperson said.', 'The marketplace was also the primary reason why Birkenstock left Amazon in 2016, followed by Nike last November. Birkenstock said at the time that Amazon had become overrun by counterfeits and unauthorized sellers, which it felt had the potential to “jeopardize” the brand. Nike initially agreed to sell on the site under the premise that Amazon would crack down on counterfeits and third-party distributors. When that didn’t happen, Nike decided to cut ties.', 'As a result of how the marketplace works, brands are no longer just Amazon’s selling partners. They’re often competing against third parties and even Amazon itself. Amazon has greatly expanded its private-label business, which includes products developed by Amazon or by third parties who exclusively sell the items on the site. It’s also widely believed that Amazon uses data from its marketplace to develop private-label brands.', 'Amazon’s aggressive private-label strategy was thrust front and center last year, when Allbirds called out Amazon for selling a nearly identical version of its $95 wool sneakers for half the price. While Allbirds never sold its shoes on Amazon, the move was viewed by the company as a clear attempt to “siphon off demand” from its product.', 'The Amazon spokesperson told CNBC its wool sneakers don’t infringe on Allbirds’ design. “This aesthetic isn’t limited to Allbirds, and similar products are also offered by several other brands,” the spokesperson said.', 'Justin Leigh, CEO of e-commerce advisory firm Ideoclick, said his company has worked with brands that have left Amazon. For some brands, the “frustration built to the point that they walked away without a strategy beyond just not doing business with [Amazon] anymore.”', 'Leigh said a brand like Ikea might find some success off of Amazon because there are “still things Amazon doesn’t do well and big, bulky items are one of them.” The site doesn’t lend itself particularly well to furniture shopping, since it’s hard to manage shipping, damages and returns on furniture, he added.', 'There are other retail areas that aren’t fulfilled by Amazon or the marketplace. Some luxury fashion companies, such as LVMH, which has brands like Louis Vuitton and Givenchy, don’t sell on the site. Amazon has realized it has to court high-fashion brands if it wants to feature those products on the platform, Thomson said, since there are few opportunities for third-party sellers to buy those items at a deep discount and resell them on the site.', 'Ultimately, if Amazon continues to clash with brands, more of them are likely to leave. But the exodus is also likely to be a slow drip rather than a flood. Bigger brands may take advantage of their consumer loyalty to move away from Amazon, but smaller businesses, as well as legacy brands that can’t compete with Amazon’s aggressive promotions and logistics network, are likely to remain for the time being.']"

The company has raised a total of about $45.5 million to date from investors including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.', 'The deal, announced Tuesday, expands on an existing partnership with Microsoft on Kano’s bright orange Windows-powered PC. It also sees Kano join the ranks of large IT players like Lenovo and Dell in obtaining original equipment manufacturer licensing from Microsoft.', 'That means Kano is now able to ship its PCs with Windows 10 Pro — a premium version of Microsoft’s operating system — to schools and has also formed a co-selling agreement with Microsoft.', 'Kano has received a tender from the Japanese government to sell 3 million of its devices in the country and is in talks to sell thousands of units in the United Arab Emirates. The firm’s PC retails at $299, cheaper than Microsoft’s Surface Go hybrid PC and on par with some of Google’s cheaper Chromebook computers.', 'It comes as demand for educational technology, or “edtech,” has surged amid the Covid-19 outbreak. Lockdowns across the world caused nationwide school closures in 190 countries at the peak of the pandemic in mid-April, impacting 90% of the world’s pupils.', 'Meanwhile, the global PC market has recently returned to growth after suffering its worst decline in sales since 2013. According to Gartner, worldwide PC shipments grew 2.8% in the second quarter, as demand for laptops and tablets increased and vendors recovered from coronavirus-related supply chain disruptions.', 'Kano started out in 2013 as a venture aimed at teaching kids how to build their own computers and code. It gained traction selling easy-to-build computer kits based on compact Raspberry Pi circuit boards that came with the open-source Linux operating system. ', 'While it hasn’t retired the Raspberry Pi kits altogether, CEO and co-founder Alex Klein told CNBC that the company has increased investment into the PC it built in partnership with Microsoft. ', 'Klein said the Linux-based computers created an “accessibility barrier” for some users but stressed his firm hasn’t forgotten the “punk rock spirit” it embraced in its early days of existence.', 'A big part of the deal, Klein said, is helping his company compete with Google in the multi-billion dollar educational computing market.', 'Google’s Chromebooks have swiftly become the top-selling computers in U.S. schools over the years. In 2018, they made up 60% of all laptops and tablets in K-12 classrooms, up from just 5% in 2012, according to data from consulting firm Futuresource. Microsoft accounted for 22% of the market in 2018, while Apple trailed behind on 18%.', '“We shouldn’t be putting Chromebooks in the hands of kids,” Klein said, referring to a warning from international non-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation that the devices enable spying on students. “They’re catching your data all the time.”', 'For its part, Google has said it’s committed to maintaining students’ privacy and doesn’t use their data for advertising purposes.', 'Speaking about Kano’s deeper ties with Microsoft, Klein said he was “inspired” by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s commitment to open-source technology. In recent years, the tech giant has bought the software development platform GitHub and built its Edge browser based on source code from Google’s open-source Chromium project.', 'As well as PCs, Kano also sells motion-sensing coding kits based on AT&T-owned Warners Bros’ “Harry Potter” franchise and Disney’s “Star Wars” series. Once assembled, the devices allow users to create code and interact with Kano’s software.', 'But Kano has yet to turn a profit. It racked up losses of £11 million in the 12 months to March 2018. The start-up also laid off around 15 employees late last year, though Klein says it hasn’t had to make any redundancies or furloughs during the coronavirus pandemic.']"
140,‘Intel is back:’ New CEO’s plan to make chips for other companies excites investors,2021-03-23T23:17:59+0000,"['In his first extended public remarks since becoming Intel CEO, Pat Gelsinger offered an underlying message: Intel, the American chipmaking giant, is getting its swagger back.', 'Intel, contrary to some industry expectations, said on Tuesday would not shift its decades-old strategy to become a chip design firm that outsources manufacturing. Instead, it will double down on manufacturing, and invest $20 billion in two new chip factories in Arizona.', '“Intel is back. The old Intel is now the new Intel,” Gelsinger said.', 'Investors had been hoping that Gelsinger, who started his career with over 30 years at Intel, could right the ship after years of challenges in which its most advanced chip development stalled and was passed by Asian rivals, like TSMC, which can currently manufacture smaller transistors and thus superior chips.', 'On Tuesday, Gelsinger was energetic when talking about esoteric semiconductor technologies, and a lot of his talk seemed to be aimed at getting Intel’s workforce fired up.', '“We’re bringing back the execution discipline of Intel. What I’ve called the Grove-ian culture that we do what we say that we’re doing to do,” Gelsinger said, referring to legendary CEO Andy Grove, who built Intel into a U.S. tech juggernaut during the 1980s and 90s. ', '“We have that confidence in our execution. That our teams are fired up. You know, if we said we’re going to do X, we’re going to do 1.1x every time we make a commitment,” Gelsinger said.', 'Investors loved it — the stock rose more than 6% in extended trading on Tuesday.', 'Gelsinger on Tuesday showed that he is wasting no time making big changes. The most significant shift in strategy is a new division called Intel Foundry Services that taps into one of the biggest trends in the semiconductor world.', 'Many top technology firms and chip makers have moved to a model where they design chips, but turn to Asian factories run by companies such as TSMC and Samsung to manufacture them.', 'Intel has only dabbled in manufacturing chips for other companies, instead preferring to design its own high-performance chips and manufacture them as well.', 'It’s going to keep manufacturing most of its high-end chips, but now, Intel will run those factories for other companies too — and they’re based in the U.S. and Europe, for customers like governments for whom that’s important.', '“I believe this is the first time Intel is actually, seriously doing what it needs to take to create a ‘real’ foundry,” said Patrick Moorhead, analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy.', 'The foundry strategy also highlights Intel’s position as a major American manufacturer, which many lawmakers have sought to protect with incentives as supply chain problems and chip shortages have revealed issues with having many of the fastest chips manufactured in places like Taiwan and Korea.', 'Intel’s announcement and its $20 billion investment in new factories on U.S. soil suggest that in a few years, companies that might have been forced to go to Asia to manufacture semiconductors could be able to get similar performance from chips fabricated in places like Arizona.', '“Today’s announcement by Intel is proof that our legislation investing in semiconductor manufacturing helps grow Arizona’s economy, creates good-paying jobs across our state, helps enhance our national security, and ensures our country continues to lead in innovation,” Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema said in a statement.', 'Gelsinger said that government incentives weren’t the only reason Intel is making this move.', '“This is the Intel strategy, period, full stop. It does not depend on a penny of government support, or state support, or any other investments to make it successful,” Gelsinger said. Intel said on Tuesday that it believed the foundry market could be worth $100 billion in 2025.', 'Intel suggested that there was a lot of demand for its foundry services, especially from big American technology companies. It said it’s received enthusiasm for its foundry services from companies including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Qualcomm. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella even appeared in a short video to endorse the plan.', 'Not on that list was Apple, which replaced Intel chips with its own chips in its latest line of laptops, spurring the most recent round of handwringing about Intel’s technical future. Intel is currently running advertisements comparing its chips to Apple’s.', 'But Gelsinger had so much swagger on Tuesday that he said he believes that Intel might be able to win that business back with its new foundry unit.', '“We’ll also pursue customers like Apple and say, ‘Boy, you know, is it possible to build and expand on your foundry capabilities as well?’” Gelsinger said.']"
141,Frequent travelers will love these new charging technologies,2019-06-23T14:00:19+0000,"['There are two kinds of new charging technologies that you need to know about. If you travel a lot, they’ll help you cut down on the number of chargers you need to bring with you. You might even want to just bring one for all of your devices.', 'And, better yet, one of the technologies, a USB specification called Power Delivery (PD), charges your devices as fast as possible, which means you’ll spend less time waiting for your phone, tablet or computer to get to 100%.', 'If you’ve used battery packs in the past and hate that they take forever to recharge, or if you’re tired of carrying several chargers for all of your gadgets, then you’ll like what you’re about to hear.', 'Charging has changed. let me explain.', 'The chargers that you use to plug your gadgets into the wall don’t have to be huge.', 'New gallium nitride (GaN) chargers are now shipping, and they include another new technology called Power Delivery.', 'Put simply, these wall chargers are the parts that your computer, tablet or phone use to plug into a wall. Normally, you might just use the one that comes with your computer, but they can either be really big and heavy, or they don’t charge your device as fast as it was built to. Apple, for example, still ships 5-watt chargers with its iPhones, even though you can charge it faster using up to an 18-watt charger. And this applies for all sorts of gadgets.', 'GaN allows the chargers to be smaller and Power Delivery allows them to deliver enough power to charge quickly.', 'Previously, you might have had to buy an iPad charger for your iPhone to get it to charge faster than the one that comes in the box. Or you could use your bulky MacBook charger for all three. But GaN chargers are super small, just slightly bigger than an iPhone charger, and they have the power to charge up to 30-watt or 45-watt devices, like a laptop. It can power your devices as long as they use the new USB-C standard.', 'What this all means is that GaN gives you the power you need in a small, compact charger that works with multiple devices and charges them quickly. So long as your product uses USB-C charging and supports Power Delivery (most new stuff does), you’re good to go. You don’t need to carry three chargers, just a single one that works with multiple products.', 'You can use a gadget like Anker’s 30W Ultra Compact Type-C Wall Charger. I bought one and use it everywhere I go to charge everything from my phone to a Nintendo Switch. The 30-watt rating is enough for MacBooks, the MacBook Air, the iPad, iPhones and Android devices. If you need something for a MacBook Pro or a similar Windows laptop that uses USB-C charging but needs up to 45-watts, a company named RAVPower has one.', 'While GaN paired with Power Delivery is great for when you have an outlet, sometimes you need to charge on the go. That’s where new Power Delivery battery packs come in. These, like the chargers, automatically charge your gadgets at the maximum speed possible, again thanks to the smarts built in to Power Delivery and USB-C.', 'Some battery packs don’t support up to 30-watts or 45-watts, however, which means they don’t have enough power to juice your laptop on the go. So, if you want something that can charge up all of your devices, look for ones that go up to 30-watts (MacBook, MacBook Air) or 45-watts (MacBook Pro, Dell XPS 13). And look for one with a lot of capacity. I like 10,000mAh or more in a battery pack, but up to 20,000mAh or more if I want it to charge a laptop, too.', 'Importantly, Power Delivery works two ways. So, while these higher capacity battery packs used to take 12 to 18 hours too charge fully, they now can charge in 4-6 hours. That means you have a pack that can juice up your iPhone 5 times, an iPad at least once or twice, or a full laptop charge, in your bag all the time.', 'I have a few models I like. OmniCharge sent me its new OmniCharge 20+, which I love. (It’s out of stock at time of publication on Amazon, but the company says more will be available in a week.) It charges itself quickly, has enough capacity to power up all of my gadgets, and even has wireless charging built in to the top so you can juice up AirPods or your phone without plugging it in.', 'A small display also indicates how much power it’s outputting or receiving, so you can tell if your gadget is getting as much juice as it can. The company also sells a smaller 12,800mAh pack for $69.99, which works well and still includes wireless charging and Power Delivery, but can’t fill your gadgets as many times. These don’t come with a Power Delivery wall charger, however, so you’ll want to buy something like the Anker product above also.', 'You might also consider the Anker PowerCore Speed 20000 PD, 20100mAh Portable Charger & 30W Power Delivery Wall Charger Bundle, which I bought for $99.99 and bring with me everywhere. It doesn’t have wireless charging, but it has plenty of juice and includes the Power Delivery wall charger for juicing up the pack as fast as possible, usually in about four to five hours.', 'All of this might sound a bit confusing, but I’ve tried to make it as simple as possible. If you carry a lot of gadgets or travel a lot, you need two things: A new GaN charger with Power Delivery and a new battery pack with Power Delivery. You’ll need to carry fewer chargers, and everything you own will charge at maximum speed. You’ll carry less weight, fewer chargers and save time.', 'Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.']"
142,Cuba-bound Carnival pioneers historic voyage,2016-05-02T14:35:45+0000,"['  On Sunday, the 704-passenger Adonia cruise ship is expected to  sail from Miami, Florida, to Havana, Cuba. In doing so, the  vessel is sailing into history — becoming the first U.S.  leisure ship to voyage between the United States and Cuba in more  than 50 years. ', '  The ship pulled out of the Port of Miami around 4pm ET,  accompanied by a large contingent of police in the water and the  Coast Guard in the air. ', '  The Adonia is part of Carnival’s Fathom brand, based around so called  “impact travel” where passengers not only take part in the usual  cruise activities like eating, drinking and sun-bathing, but have  the opportunity to learn from and work with locals in each port  of call. ', '  Passengers “will have free time and be able to go on your own a  bit, so I’m not sure it will feel that different” from a full  fledged leisure cruise, Carnival CEO Arnold Donald told CNBC in  an on-board interview. He said the cruise was completely sold  out, and there were about a dozen Cuban-born passengers on board.', '  Those factors are what makes this legal. American’s still cannot  legally visit Cuba as tourists, but they can if they qualify for  one of 12 categories, including “people-to-people” and “cultural  exchange” programs offered under Fathom’s umbrella.', '  As protesters rode along the side of the ship, passengers lined  the upper decks waving American and Cuban flags. Donald and  Fathom president Tara Russell gave a short speech to the  passengers, thanking the crew and employees that made the cruise  happen.', '  “We’re delighted to be here,” said Donald. “We’re humbled, it’s an honor, it’s a  privilege.” ', 'Other Carnival brands will be travelling to Cuba over time as port space becomes available, he said. ', '“This is not about going there like you would to another  Caribbean Island and just going to hang out at the beach. This is  not the purpose of this cruise,” said travel expert Stewart  Chiron, also known as “The Cruise Guy.” ', '  Still, the planned activities hardly seem to qualify as hard  labor. Passengers will spend their days on shore excursions,  where they will have options to experience dance and musical  performances, meet with business owners, students and artists  — all as part of their cultural exchange programs. The  experience does not come cheap, however: A balcony room for two  adults runs for nearly $9,000.', '  “It’s not cheap but we are still a better value if you were to go  by air and book your own travel,” Donald told CNBC.', '  The Adonia will travel to Cuba every other week with stops in  three ports of call; Havana, Cienfuegos and Santiago de Cuba.  During the off weeks, the ship will be in the Dominican Republic  on a similar impact travel trip. That trip however, comes at  nearly a third of the cost. ', '  Chiron explained that the cost is “disproportionate compared to  the same cruise on the same ship that is going to the Dominican  Republic.” However he added it’s worth the money, especially  considering the historical value. ', '  “Right now they are the only game in town so why leave money on  the table? It is going to provide a very unique experience that  no one else can offer,” Chiron said. ', '  The trip almost didn’t happen. Just weeks before the Adonia was  set to leave Miami for Havana, Carnival came under heavy pressure  from anti-Castro activists. At the time, the company said it  would hold off on the trip until the Cuban government allowed  Cuban-born Americans to travel to the island nation by sea — a prohibition against that had been on the books in Cuba for  decades. ', '  Yet with just days to spare, the countries government made a  concession — allowing Cuban born Americans to travel to Cuba  by sea, something they had been allowed to do by air for  years. ', '  With law changed, one can expect more cruise companies aiming  their ships towards Cuba. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is one  of those companies: The company’s president and (Cuban-born) CEO  Frank Del Rio said in a recent statement that Norwegian’s Oceania  brand “continues discussions with Cuban officials seeking  approval to commence cruises to Cuba later this year.”', '  Del Rio added that he has “every confidence that the Cuban  government would allow its natural born citizens to visit the  island nation by cruise ship as they have allowed Cuban Americans  to travel by air for years. I am very much looking forward to  sailing to Cuba soon aboard one of our ships in the company of  many fellow Cuban Americans and other fellow Americans who wish  to share in the excitement and passion that cruising to Cuba  brings.”', '  That said, there are lingering questions as to whether or not  Cuba itself can handle the influx of tourists and cruise ships.  Docking space is extremely limited throughout the island. That  means companies which hope to send larger cruise vessels to the  Island may have to consider using tenders to get passengers to  and from the actual port. ', '  “There will have to be a lot of tenders to be able to transport  passengers because they don’t have the docking facilities to  handle these large ships,” Chiron said. “Countries have spent  hundreds of millions of dollars building up their port  infrastructure so this type of a boom is not going to happen  overnight.” ', 'While Congress has not yet approved American tourism to Cuba, Donald says that Carnival is following the approved forms of travel dictated by the government. ', '“You can still have a great time within those confines,” he said. “You’ll get to experience all the beautiful things in Cuba, we make it easy. There’s no better way than to go on Fathom ... Cuba has been very cooperative.”', 'He also believes that a stop in Cuba will reinvigorate the line’s trips to the Caribbean, calling it “refreshing” for people who have been to the Caribbean before and are looking for something new.

The e-commerce giant has invested $700 million in Rivian, which has plans to provide Amazon with more than 100,000 electric delivery vans in 2021. Ford invested $500 million in Rivian, and the companies will partner to build new electric battery vehicles.', 'Meanwhile, UPS said Wednesday it is testing self-driving minivans with Alphabet subsidiary Waymo in the Phoenix area over the next six months.', 'In February, an autonomous minivan will transport packages from a UPS Store to a UPS sorting facility. A Waymo engineer will ride in the autonomous vehicle to monitor operations at least initially.

Automation upgrades will be made to three other facilities in the region to speed sorting and shipping of packages between Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, New York, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. All together the upgrades will help add more than 1,700 new jobs, UPS said.', 'Other facility expansions are also planned for this year.', 'As part of its three-year plan, announced in 2018, UPS is targeting $20 billion in capital expenditures.', 'FedEx has committed more than $17 billion to capex spending between 2018 and 2020, including an estimated $5.9 billion this fiscal year, according to its 2019 annual report.

Gyms have reopened, and outdoor runs and vacations beckoned during the summer months. What investors hadn’t anticipated was a 20% price cut in the company’s top-selling product and a ramp up in marketing spending.', 'Growth is slowing, and it’s less profitable growth.', 'Roughly $2.9 billion of Peloton’s market capitalization was lopped off on Friday, the day after the pricing announcement was made and the company reported a wider-than-expected loss in its fiscal fourth quarter.', 'For most of 2020, the company rode a wave of homebound consumers willing to spend thousands of dollars to burn calories when gyms were shuttered due to the pandemic. Such heightened demand resulted in supply chain snafus, forcing Peloton to shell out more money to speed deliveries. Nonetheless, growth was coming much easier than it could have imagined. Peloton’s quarterly revenue ballooned to more than $1 billion for the first time, as the year came to a close.', 'Just two years ago, Peloton counted 511,000 connected fitness subscribers. Now, the company boasts 2.33 million. These are people who shell out $39 per month to access Peloton’s digital workout content, in addition to owning one of the company’s at-home fitness machines.', 'Its stock has gone along for the ride, too. Peloton was one of the biggest gainers on the Nasdaq 100 last year, with shares rallying 434% in 2020. But so far this year, its share price has tumbled nearly 30%, closing Friday at $104.34, as investors stare down a new reality.', 'Wall Street has mixed opinions on where the stock might go next. According to FactSet, analysts’ average price target is $133.40. That’s solidly above its 52-week low of $68.06 last August. But a good measure below its all-time high of $171.09 in January.', 'What many can agree on, though, is that Peloton’s path to profitability is changing.', '“If you had told me yesterday that Peloton would guide to 1.3 million connected fitness net adds for fiscal 2022, I would’ve said the stock would be up 10%,” J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth said in a note to clients. “But the composition of how Peloton is getting there is different than expected. The reduction [in the Bike price] is bigger and sooner than we expected.”', 'Anmuth holds a price target of $138 on Peloton shares. He still expects international expansion and future product launches, including a rumored rowing machine, will help to fuel growth.', 'But Peloton is forecasting an adjusted loss of $325 million, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, in fiscal 2022, which just started. The company doesn’t expect to be profitable again until 2023.', 'In its latest quarter ended June 30, total gross margins fell to 27%, from nearly 48% in the year-ago quarter, as costs associated with a treadmill recall and extra expenses for shipping ate into profits.', '“Over the past year and a half, [Peloton] hasn’t really had to pull any levers,” Wedbush analyst James Hardiman said in an interview on CNBC’s “Tech Check” Friday. “And now, for them to continue to fuel this growth story ... they are going to have to play their cards exactly right for the current valuation to stick.”', 'Not only is Peloton slashing the price of its Bike, but it will hike marketing spending significantly in the coming months. It’s facing stiffer competition in the connected fitness space, from the likes of Hydrow, Tonal and Lululemon-owned Mirror.', 'Peloton hasn’t disclosed exactly how much it plans to spend, but sales and marketing expenses in its latest quarter climbed 172% from a year earlier.', 'In a phone interview with CNBC, Peloton President William Lynch said the company plans to use a range of paid media advertisements to raise awareness around its Tread, in particular.

Yet, Peloton is still far from doing so. And lowering the Bike price might not be enough of a catalyst to get it there, he said.', 'According to FactSet, Siegel has the lowest price target among Wall Street analysts for Peloton shares, at $45. That would imply Peloton’s value would be cut by more than half from where it is currently trading.', '“Lowering the cost of the Bike may grab new customers, but it shouldn’t extend their lifetimes,” Siegel said. “And if anything, one can make hypothesis that the lower the initial cost, the lower the barrier to churn [or drop the service].”', '“If competition remains elevated, which we believe it will, we worry marketing [costs] will see ongoing growth, rather than vice versa,” Siegel added.', 'Management explained that Peloton is cutting prices — of what is its least expensive product — in order to reach more customers who would not be able to afford the company’s equipment otherwise. The company also said it has built up enough manufacturing capacity in recent months to be able to afford the price reduction, as it achieves greater production efficiencies.', 'When questioned by analysts, Chief Executive John Foley commented during an earnings conference call that Peloton is acting on the offensive — not the defensive.', '“As we think about the competitive landscape, we think about democratizing access to great fitness, which has always been in our playbook,” he said.', 'Foley has also said that Peloton believes its treadmill business will one day be two-to-three times the size of what its Bike business is today. The company doesn’t currently break out revenue from cycles versus treadmills.', 'Peloton’s growth in the treadmill category has been on pause after the company recalled of its Tread and Tread+ machines due to reported injuries and one child’s death. The company, notably, faces several related lawsuits. And on Friday it revealed the U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security have subpoenaed Peloton for more information on the matter.', 'As Peloton resumes sales of the Tread — the less expensive of the two machines — analysts should be able to glean more insights into how consumers are responding. (It’s unclear when Tread+ sales will resume.)', 'Bank of America upgraded the fitness company’s stock on Friday, to buy from neutral, and raised its price target by $3 to $138 per share. The Wall Street firm said it is most bullish on the opportunity for Peloton to grow its treadmill sales in the years ahead.', '“Peloton indicated that Tread leads have been ‘incredibly strong’, and we trust that this enthusiasm on the launch is not unwarranted,” analyst Justin Post said in a research note. “Six months from now, we think [subscription] adds will be more important for the stock than margins.”', '—CNBC’s Michael Bloom and Crystal Mercedes contributed to this report.']"
146,That missing iPhone 12 charging plug is poised to provide a boost to one of Apple’s hottest growth areas,2020-10-23T14:26:07+0000,"['Your new iPhone 12 comes without a wall plug in the box.', 'Yes, that’s annoying. And yes, that means you’ll need to drop $19 on a plug that works with the new type of cable that comes with the iPhone 12 to enable faster charging. (Don’t worry, you can still keep your old iPhone’s plug and charging cord and it’ll work with the new iPhone 12.)', 'Despite Apple’s claim that the absence of the plug was a pro-environment move, it’s on track to see an uptick in its hardware accessories and wearables category thanks to the sale of the plugs and the new ecosystem it’s building around the iPhone 12′s MagSafe charging system.', 'That category, which includes products such as the Apple Watch, AirPods, chargers and other accessories, has already shown promising growth. Sales jumped nearly 17% to $6.45 billion in Apple’s fiscal third quarter. Apple is scheduled to report its fiscal fourth-quarter results on Oct. 29, but it won’t reflect sales of the iPhone 12 and related products, which went on sale Friday.', 'Accessories and wearables are following a similar story we’ve seen with Apple’s services business, which includes digital products such as streaming music and iCloud storage. With iPhone sales no longer showing growth, Apple has come up with new digital products to leverage more out of its user base of about 1 billion iPhone users. Apple generated $13.16 billion in services revenue for the fiscal third quarter, up nearly 15% from the year before.', 'Between the missing plug ($19), missing wired earphones (wireless AirPods start at $159) and the new MagSafe charger ($39) for the iPhone 12, Apple is poised to see a significant boost in accessory sales this quarter. On top of that, Apple has a new $99 version of the HomePod speaker that goes on sale next month and the Apple Watch is cheaper than ever, starting at $199.', 'Deutsche Bank analysts picked up on that potential growth in a research note earlier this week.', '“While [Apple] claims that they are not shipping earphones and a charging cube with the iPhone to save the environment (they are including a charging cord), the reality is that such a decision could drive a financial benefit for the company as well,” the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote.', 'Looking beyond the near-term sales of the iPhone 12, Apple’s new magnetic charging system, MagSafe, is laying the groundwork for even more accessories for the iPhone. There have long been rumors that Apple’s ultimate goal is to remove the charging port in the iPhone, like it did for the standard headphone jack, which will in turn drive iPhone owners to buy even more extras for their devices.', 'Maybe Apple is sincere when it says removing standard accessories from the iPhone box is good for the environment. When you’re shipping tens of millions of iPhones per quarter with less packaging and plastic, there’s sure to be a positive impact on the environment. But at that scale, it also drives iPhone customers to buy more high-margin extras from Apple so they can get the most out of their iPhone. And that keeps revenues growing.']"

One of the biggest impacts of that was Huawei being cut off from using Google’s Android operating system. That’s not a big deal in China where Google services such as Gmail and search are blocked. But overseas, consumers are used to Android.', 'And last year, Washington moved to cut Huawei off from the chips it required for its smartphones. These two actions have hurt Huawei’s sales. The Chinese firm’s fourth quarter global smartphone shipments fell 41% year-on-year, according to Counterpoint Research. In Europe, it saw a 62% plunge.', '“The rise of OPPO can be attributed to being a beneficiary of a big void left by Huawei.

The X3 Pro will directly compete with these devices.', 'But in more mature markets like Europe, Oppo will need to build a “high end image” like Apple and Samsung, according to Will Wong, research manager at International Data Corporation, which could be a challenge for Oppo.', '“Oppo needs to target those higher income consumers who like to have those high-end products. Launching the Find X3 series is important to build this high-end image,” Wong said.']"

His predecessor Steve Jobs founded the company, and returned from exile to bring Apple back from the brink of death and launch the products that defined Apple as a modern computing juggernaut: The iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad.', 'But Cook says that Jobs told him to be his own leader, and never to ask “what would Steve do?” He took that advice, building a rigorous operational juggernaut and turning Apple into the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.', 'Under Cook, Apple shored up the iPhone business and bolstered it with a constellation of new products that attract new customers and entrench current customers in Apple’s world. Since 2011, the company has released several new products, including the Apple Watch and AirPods.', 'Cook’s Apple is significantly bigger than it was when he took over, and it also faces new challenges, from navigating politics around the world to the perennial question about what its next big product is.', 'Ultimately, Apple’s board is happy with Cook and his performance. In September, Apple’s board granted Cook shares and performance-based awards that could give him more than 1 million Apple shares through 2026, his first stock grant since he took over.', 'Here’s Cook’s 10-year report card.', 'Cook had been acting CEO before he officially took over, but the difference between the quarter before Cook took charge and today’s sales underscores how much larger Apple has gotten.', 'In the third fiscal quarter of 2011, Apple reported $28.57 billion in revenue. This year, in the same quarter and the most recent quarter which figures are available, Apple reported $81.4 billion in sales — nearly three times as much.', 'Apple’s iPhone alone accounted for nearly $39.6 billion last quarter, which is more than the company’s entire sales when Cook took over.', 'Investors would be happy if they bought Apple on Cook’s first day. An investment of $1,000 in Apple stock on Aug. 24, 2011, would be worth more than $16,866 as of Monday, an over 32% annual rate of return if they reinvested all dividends. The S&P 500 only returned just more than 16% annually over the same period.', 'Apple has worked to reduce its share count through stock buybacks. Apple CFO Luca Maestri said in July that the company has spent more than $450 billion on buybacks and dividends since it started its capital return program in 2012.', 'In 2011, Apple had 929,409,000 shares outstanding.

It’s also bundling its services in a subscription called Apple One. Most recently, it’s started to add privacy features to paid iCloud accounts.', 'The growth of Apple’s services business from $2.95 billion in fiscal 2011 to $53.77 billion in fiscal 2020 has given investors confidence that it can find new revenue streams even as iPhone sales slow.', 'Jobs was known as a product-focused CEO who was involved in the development of new devices from their conception until they were on store shelves.', 'Cook isn’t as product focused as his predecessor, but his Apple has managed to launch several new successful products.', 'In 2015, Apple released Apple Watch, a companion for the iPhone that tracked heart rate, displayed notifications and worked with a variety compatible watch bands from fashion brands like Hermes.', 'While Apple has never released unit sales numbers or even direct revenue from the watch, one estimate from Counterpoint Research says that Apple shipped 33.9 million watches in 2020, far outpacing Huawei, the second-place company, which only shipped 11 million smartwatches.', 'Apple also released AirPods in 2016.

By 2020, after being bolstered by the release of both Apple Watch and AirPods, it had more than $30.6 billion in revenue and the moniker Wearables, Home and Accessories.', 'Apple’s main product remains the iPhone, which accounted for 47% of the company’s sales in the most recent quarter. But under Cook’s watch, the iPhone has improved on a rigorous annual release schedule. When Cook took over, the most advanced iPhone was the iPhone 4, with a 5 megapixel camera and a 3.5-inch screen. Modern iPhone 12 devices can come with as many as three cameras, 6.7-inch screens and an Apple-designed processor that rivals the fastest computer chips.', 'Prices have risen, too — the iPhone 4 cost $599 for an entry-level model ($199 with a carrier contract). Today, Pro models start at $999.', 'A month after Cook took over, Apple had 60,400 full-time employees. Now it has 147,000 full-time employees in countries around the world, according to a filing last fall.', 'Apple’s global operations will create new challenges for the company. Cook personally navigated a relationship with former President Donald Trump as the U.S. placed tariffs on parts and products that Apple imports. It also faces pressure from China and other governments over the apps it has in its store and how it operates its cloud services.', 'In the U.S., Apple has been lumped in with other dominant tech companies as having too much power. In Apple’s case, regulators and critics have focused on the App Store, the only way for consumers to install software on an iPhone. Detractors claim it has arbitrary rules and decry Apple’s cut of 30% of most purchases, which they say is too much.', 'Later this year, a judge in Oakland, California, will decide whether Apple broke antirust laws, prompted by a lawsuit from Fortnite maker Epic Games. Cook testified in court for the first time as CEO during that trial. Apple also faces legislation currently being debated in Congress which would force the company to change the way it administers its software stores. Apple has denied that it holds a monopoly over its app store.', 'Apple also gets questions about what its next big product may be. It’s been investing heavily in researching self-driving electric cars, but a release date is likely years away. It is working in the health world to allow users to store medical records and communicate with their doctors, but Apple hasn’t released any health hardware except for its Apple Watch. Apple is also working on virtual reality and augmented reality headsets, but those would represent a big new category that hasn’t yet caught on with consumers.', 'Whatever comes next for Apple, Cook remains a steady hand at its helm.']"

However, Devialet CEO Franck Lebouchard told CNBC that the pricing was in line with other high-end wireless earbuds.', '“Two years ago, we were struggling to decide which product we would want to launch next,” Lebouchard said in an interview. “The reason why we made that decision on true wireless was really around offering a great sound experience to many people, not only audiophiles.”', 'He said Gemini stands out because it comes from a company whose specialty is high-end audio products. Devialet’s loud, bass-heavy Phantom speakers have won fans ranging from Tesla CEO Elon Musk to YouTube star Marques Brownlee, though they’re very much targeted at the luxury end of the music tech sector.', 'With Gemini, Devialet is touting “market-leading” noise cancellation and a patented technology that adjusts to movements from the wearer. Other notable specs include up to 8 hours of battery life, wireless charging and the option to open the charging case up to replace its battery.', 'Devialet, which has yet to turn a profit, will face an uphill battle launching Gemini in the U.S. due to the level of competition from Apple. The company is expecting more success in China, where it’s partnered with Huawei to help build the latter’s own smart speaker, Sound X.', '“We’ve been investing a lot in China,” Lebouchard told CNBC, adding it’s the firm’s “second-largest” market by revenues after France. The company’s wireless headphones would also face heavy competition in China from both Xiaomi and Huawei.', 'Devialet’s chief said the firm had been working on Gemini for around two years and took the decision to continue working on the product from home as the coronavirus pandemic began to spread across Europe earlier this year. He admitted having “no clue on how many we’re going to sell” but that he was adamant on launching them in time for the holidays.', 'Shoppers will be spoiled for choice when it comes to consumer electronics this year, with Apple expected to launch new 5G iPhones and new video game consoles from Microsoft and Sony dropping next month.

The report recommended a wide range of remedies, including splitting different business units and forcing companies to prove mergers would be pro-competitive before allowing them to conclude. ', 'In Amazon’s case, for instance, the company could be required to split apart its core e-commerce site from the third-party marketplace where independent vendors sell their products, and from the Amazon Web Services cloud-computing service. ', 'The committee’s report bucked industry figures estimating Amazon’s controlling share of the e-commerce market. They said Amazon likely controls about 50% or more of the U.S. online retail market, which is higher than researcher eMarketer’s estimate of 38%. ', 'Amazon has stifled competition in other areas than retail, lawmakers found. They concluded that Amazon’s role as a dominant provider of cloud-computing services and its power in other markets creates a conflict of interest that “Amazon has the incentive and ability to exploit.” Amazon has also imposed barriers to entry for other voice-enabled device manufacturers by pricing its Alexa-enabled products below cost, lawmakers said. ', 'Amazon also operates more than 150 fulfillment centers, sortation centers and delivery stations, along with a sprawling network of planes, vans and contracted delivery drivers. This combination has allowed Amazon to ship a growing number number of products itself, rivaling UPS and FedEx, and serves as one of several barriers to entry for competitors. The “steep costs” associated with building a logistics network that’s comparable in size to what Amazon has built makes “a challenger to Amazon unlikely,” they said.', 'SEE ALSO: ', 'Facebook is a social network monopoly that buys, copies or kills competitors, antitrust committee finds', 'Apple’s ‘monopoly power’ over iPhone app distribution gives it outsized profits, Democrats say', 'Google ‘overwhelmingly’ dominates search market, antitrust committee states', 'Amazon disputed the lawmakers’ findings, saying that their recommendations would reduce competition, forcing “millions of independent retailers out of online stores” and resulting in less choice and higher prices for consumers.', '“All large organizations attract the attention of regulators, and we welcome that scrutiny. But large companies are not dominant by definition, and the presumption that success can only be the result of anti-competitive behavior is simply wrong,” the company said. “And yet, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, those fallacies are at the core of this regulatory spit-balling on antitrust.”', 'In some cases, the threat of competing with Amazon can push start-ups to avoid certain industries entirely.', 'One unnamed venture capital investor in the cloud market told lawmakers: “I think of Amazon as the sun. It is useful but also dangerous. If you’re far enough away you can bask. If you get too close you’ll get incinerated. So, you have to be far enough from Amazon and be doing something that they wouldn’t do. If you’re a net consumer of Amazon’s infrastructure, like Uber, then you’re okay. As long as Amazon doesn’t want to get into ridesharing. But it’s hard to predict what Amazon wants to get into. If they were going to stop at retail and computing, you’re safe. But you can’t know.”', 'Lawmakers also found direct evidence that Amazon viewed Zappos and Quidsi as “competitive threats prior to acquiring them,” citing documents reviewed by subcommittee staff.', 'Before Amazon acquired Zappos in 2009, it referred to the online shoe retailer as one of the “primary competitors” of Amazon’s now-defunct fashion website Endless.com. Zappos gave Endless access to “hold-out” brands that previously “refused to sell on Amazon.com” or Endless, lawmakers said. Similarly, Amazon sought to acquire Quidsi in 2010 after it engaged in an “aggressive price war” to weaken its subsidiary Diapers.com, which was a competitor to Amazon.', 'Amazon’s third-party marketplace, made up of millions of merchants, has become a critical part of Amazon’s e-commerce business. The marketplace now accounts for more than half of Amazon’s overall sales. It has been a focus of antitrust investigators in the U.S. and abroad, who believe Amazon uses its power to squeeze the merchants that sell on its platform. ', 'Lawmakers concluded that Amazon’s dual role selling products on its own web site and running a marketplace for third-party sellers “creates an inherent conflict of interest” that encourages Amazon to exploit its access to competing sellers’ data and information. It noted that Amazon publicly describes these sellers as “partners,” but “behind closed doors, the company refers to them as ‘internal competitors.’”', 'Third-party sellers described a pervasive environment of “bullying,” wherein the threat of financial burden that comes with an account suspension or product de-listing causes some sellers to “live in fear of the company.”', 'Third-party merchants told the subcommittee that they’re often left without any recourse after their account has been shut down. When sellers have to appeal an issue with Amazon, they face such “atrocious levels of customer service” that often they resort to a “Jeff Bomb,” or an email to CEO Jeff Bezos “to plead their case.”', '“For sellers, Amazon functions as a ‘quasistate,’ and many ‘[s]ellers are more worried about a case being opened on Amazon than in actual court,’” lawmakers said. ', 'Amazon’s own documents show that it manipulates its all-important buy box algorithm “to do what is best for Amazon’s bottom line, not customers” lawmakers said. The buy box offers customers a one-click button to add a listed product to their shopping cart or buy it. ', 'This directly contradicts Amazon’s previous explanation for how the buy box works. Amazon has maintained that the buy box predicts the price consumers would most likely choose after reviewing competing products elsewhere.', 'Amazon also employs “strong-arm tactics” in negotiations with vendors who sell directly to the company, lawmakers said. The report references an exchange with an unnamed company, wherein Amazon leveraged its e-commerce dominance to force acceptance of certain terms and conditions. During negotiations, Amazon “repeatedly referenced” its ability to destock the unnamed company’s products on as a “bargaining chip to force terms” that were “unrelated to retail distribution.” ', 'Lawmakers argued that Amazon’s scope, acquisitions, and pricing strategy have given it an unfair advantage in the voice enabled assistant market. ', 'Amazon’s Alexa Voice Service, which enables hardware makers to make their devices compatible with Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant, is hosted on AWS, “allowing it to bind products and developers to its cloud platform.” This may also give Amazon a “potential head-start” in converting those Alexa partners into customers of AWS or other Amazon services in the future,” they said. ', 'Amazon has expanded Alexa’s ecosystem quickly through acquisitions of complementary and competing technology, lawmakers said. Internal emails between Amazon executives revealed that Amazon sought to control both the “eyes and ears,” with the “ears” referring to its Alexa ecosystem. Smart device makers Blink and Ring, which Amazon acquired in 2017 and 2018, respectively, would serve as “Amazon’s ‘eyes’ right outside the home,” the report said. ', 'The company also favors Amazon services with default voice commands on Alexa devices, including AmazonBasics and Prime Music, and users must go out of their way to voice shop on other stores, lawmakers said. When it comes to its online marketplace, Amazon acts as a “gatekeeper” against competitors, using the threat of delisting a competitor’s product to “ensure that Alexa is enabled on other company’s devices, or to secure favorable contractual terms.”', 'Democrats concluded that Amazon uses a “predatory pricing strategy to increase its sales of smart home devices by pricing its products below cost.” This strategy has created “significant” barriers to entry for companies looking to compete in the voice enabled assistant market and even created challenges for fellow tech giant Google. In a 2018 email, one Google employee remarked that “fighting Amazon with a very-hard-to-differentiate product and a channel disadvantage and a huge economic disadvantage (due to channel mix margin differences) is already like fighting a shark on a surfboard.”', 'AWS is more profitable than the rest of Amazon, and that profit from the cloud business allows Amazon to keep funding its business, the subcommittee said. ', 'Amazon leads the cloud-infrastructure market. The subcommittee found evidence suggested that AWS sought to build on its leadership position and keep existing customers from going elsewhere.', 'More people know how to use Amazon’s cloud than other clouds, making it easier to choose Amazon and harder to leave, and the high cost of migrating to other clouds helps AWS maintain its strength, the subcommittee asserted. ', 'Amazon also charges customers when they went to send data out of AWS, and people told the subcommittee that “they view these fees less as a cost for Amazon to transport data and more as friction imposed by Amazon for switching providers.” Because Amazon is dominant in cloud computing and other markets, the company has a conflict of interest it can take advantage of, the subcommittee said.', 'AWS’ has built services based on open-source projects such as Elasticsearch and MongoDB that compete with services built by the companies that first developed those open-source software projects. These services, including AWS’ DocumentDB database service that draws on MongoDB, could wind up locking customers into AWS, the subcommittee argued.', '“When a cloud customer chooses to build an application using DocumentDB they are tied to AWS’s infrastructure,” the report said. “If they ever wanted to switch to another provider they would have to extensively re-engineer their product in another software, whereas, had they built their application using MongoDB — on AWS or any other cloud provider’s infrastructure — their applications could move to other platforms.” ', 'MongoDB and other software companies responded by changing the licenses on their open-source libraries. People told the committee they thought the license changes could lead to lesser access to innovative software for groups that lack abundant financial resources. Many people think AWS makes more from their versions of open-source software than third-party providers, the report said.']"

', 'Facing a surge in e-commerce activity, big retailers are turning to a relatively new storage method, known as on-demand warehouses. The idea has been compared to Airbnb, since it allows retailers to browse and rent unused warehouse space, without having to lease or build an entire facility. Retailers rent the space on a pay-as-you-go basis, letting them scale up or down on space depending on their needs. ', 'Certain companies could stand to benefit from the trend.']"

157,These electric submarines map the seafloor to make way for wind power,2021-08-19T12:57:29+0000,"['In March, the departments of Energy, Interior and Commerce said they were aiming for U.S. offshore wind capacity to hit 30 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, a hugely optimistic goal that would require thousands of new wind turbines to be installed off the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts.', 'With federal support locked in, now it’s up to developers and operators to figure out where it’s safe to install offshore wind farms and pursue permits.', 'Bedrock, a Richmond, California, start-up, wants to help them map the seafloor using electric autonomous underwater vehicles (e-AUV) that can launch right from the shore.', 'Traditionally, marine surveys would require a large, crewed ship and heavy sonar equipment that would generate terabytes of data stored on hard drives that had to be mailed somewhere for processing and analysis.', 'Marine surveys like that can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and take up to a full year, says Bedrock co-founder and CEO Anthony DiMare.', 'By contrast his company’s electric mini sub gathers data using lighter-weight sonar and other sensors, then transmits it to Bedrock’s cloud-based service. The company’s Mosaic software makes it usable almost right away from a work PC.', 'Bedrock’s electric submarines run on a lithium-ion battery that can be swapped out for a freshly charged one when needed. They run for 12- or 24-hour missions, typically at a speed of 2 to 3 knots (or less than 5 mph) to conduct surveys up to 300 meters in depth.', 'Bedrock was co-founded in 2019 by DiMare, a repeat entrepreneur and mechanical engineer, along with CTO Charlie Chiau, a former SpaceX systems integration engineer.', 'They told CNBC the company is focused on the needs of the domestic offshore wind industry right now, further motivated by the urgency of the IPCC report earlier this month.', 'However, Bedrock’s seafloor mapping technology can be put to use in many other industries. For example, it can find aging oil and gas infrastructure that may need to be decommissioned. It can also be used for data center planning underwater.', 'To test the AUVs before they’re taken to the open water, Chiau says Bedrock has installed a 20-foot long, 5-foot deep circular tank in its Richmond office. This functions like an underwater treadmill, mimicking currents and conditions an electric submarine would likely encounter in an ocean or perhaps the Great Lakes.', 'The company has just one electric submarine operating commercially at this time, but the founders intend to build and send fleets of them into the water.', 'In March, Bedrock closed an $8 million seed round of funding, which it plans to use for hiring, refinements and production of more of its electric submarines, as well as cloud services and software development.', 'DiMare said the first 50 gigabytes of seafloor data will always be free for any user of the company’s Mosaic software to store and access. It was important to the co-founders that they give independent researchers and smaller teams access to the same kind of tools large renewable energy developers might have.', 'Near term, Bedrock expects to make money by selling seafloor mapping and software as a service.

SpaceX first rolled out the service with a beta program for select consumers for $99 a month, and in the past year has begun looking to test the network for aviation service inflight and expand the service to large moving vehicles, like ships and trucks.', 'While Starlink service is still in beta, the company recently said that the network has about 90,000 users in 12 countries so far, with over half a million orders or refundable deposits placed by potential customers.', 'SpaceX has launched 1,740 Starlink satellites to date, with its first generation system beginning launches in November 2019. Gen2 is planned to have nearly 30,000 satellites in total.', 'SpaceX says the Gen2 Starlink satellites are heavier and “will be somewhat larger and generate more power than originally” designed. That will allow the satellites to “support expanded capabilities” for SpaceX’s network, as well as “accommodate additional payloads in the future” – the latter meaning Starlink satellites may be able to host sensors or antenna for other companies.', 'The “preferred configuration” for Gen2 would feature 29,988 Starlink satellites in orbit, deployed at nine altitudes, ranging from 340 kilometers to 614 kilometers. Previously SpaceX had proposed Starlink would have 30,000 satellites across eight altitudes, ranging from 328 kilometers to 614 kilometers.', '“SpaceX would target multiple inclinations to more evenly spread capacity by latitude, ensuring better, more consistent global coverage,” the filing said.', 'Additionally, SpaceX’s amended plan would “nearly double the number of satellites deployed in a sun-synchronous orbit,” which would allow the company to provide better “service to polar regions like Alaska.”', 'The company also noted that “SpaceX has invested in advanced propulsion capabilities for its satellites,” so that the “collision risk with large objects is considered to be zero while the spacecraft are capable of maneuvering.” When a Starlink satellite malfunctions, SpaceX disposes of the satellite by reentering into the Earth’s atmosphere so that it burns up and disintegrates.', 'SpaceX emphasized that, if a Starlink satellite is out of control, the low altitude of the satellites in orbit mean the spacecraft would be in orbit for “less than four years” before reentering.', 'Space debris is another threat both to and from Starlink satellites that SpaceX aims to further protect against with Gen2.', '“SpaceX is also aware of the possibility that its system could become a source of debris in the unlikely case of a collision with small debris or meteoroids that could either create jetsam or cause loss of control of the spacecraft and prevent post-mission disposal,” the company wrote. “SpaceX has continued to explore ways to make its spacecraft even more resistant to such strikes. Although the design of these protective features is still being finalized, SpaceX has improved redundancy in the power and propulsion systems.”', 'SpaceX has talked before about the additional capabilities that Starship would bring to deploying its Starlink network, but the filing on Wednesday outlined that it plans to use the massive rocket as the primary delivery system for Gen2.', 'The company’s leadership has previously touted the increased capability Starship would bring. Its Falcon 9 rocket can launch 60 Starlink satellites at a time, but Starship would be able to “take 400 satellites at a time,” SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell said in 2019.', 'Amending Starlink’s altitudes and constellation design would also allow SpaceX to launch the satellites directly into intended orbits with Starship, the company said.', '“The revised orbital planes would enable single plane launch campaigns that capitalize on the ability of Starship to deliver satellites at a faster pace by not necessarily requiring a waiting period for orbital precession in a parking orbit. SpaceX could deploy satellites into their operational orbits within a matter of weeks after launch, rather than months,” the company added.', 'SpaceX also included a deployment plan for Gen2 that continues to utilize its Falcon 9 rockets, in case Starship is not operational by the time the new Starlink system begins launching. The company has completed multiple test flights of Starship prototypes over the past year, and is moving closer to its first orbital flight attempt. SpaceX recently stacked prototype Starship 20 on a Super Heavy rocket booster for the first time. Musk said last weekend that it “should be ready for flight in a few weeks, pending only regulatory approval” to launch.', 'Starship and Starlink each represent multi-billion dollar projects that are key to SpaceX’s growth, driving much of the company’s $74 billion valuation.']"
