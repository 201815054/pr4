Asia's third-largest economy is expected to contract by as much as 10% in the current fiscal year beginning April, some private economists' estimate, after the outbreak crippled business and consumer activity since late March, compared to government's earlier target of about 6% growth.
The government has announced a raft of measures including direct food subsidy to nearly 810 million people and credit guarantees of 3 trillion rupees ($40.17 billion) on loans to small businesses. 
Tarun Bajaj, economic affairs secretary at the Ministry of Finance, told a virtual conference that incentives would be offered to sectors to push manufacturing and help struggling industries.
Bajaj didn't specify the sectors that may be eligible for incentives. 
The government earlier announced production linked incentives for large scale electronic goods makers for five years, to attract investments in mobile phone manufacturing and electronic component units.
Incentives have also been announced for pharmaceutical companies for production of bulk drugs and on medical devices.
Speaking at a virtual conference organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) on Thursday, finance ministry official said the government was expecting a ""V"" shape economic recovery beginning next fiscal year. 
Reuters earlier reported that India is drawing up an incentive scheme for the autos sector aimed at doubling exports of vehicles and components in the next five years.
Industry and government sources said sectors such as textile and food processing manufacturers could be offered production linked incentives.
The latest data on 14-15 economic indicators including railway freight and tax collections showed a pick up in economic activities, Bajaj said, adding the government was open to borrow more from the market to meet spending targets for infrastructure projects.

1,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 01:55AM ET</span>","Australia, facing 'harsh reality' of pandemic, braces for biggest postwar deficit","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's budget is set to plunge into its biggest deficit since World War Two this year as the coronavirus crisis knocks the country into its first recession in three decades and forces policymakers to roll out hundreds of billions of dollars in stimulus.
Although Australia has managed the pandemic better than most developed nations, the shattering global impact of the outbreak has left its trade-exposed A$2 trillion ($1.43 trillion) economy grappling with skyrocketing unemployment as many businesses sink in red ink.
In a special announcement on Thursday, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the budget swung into a massive deficit of A$85.8 billion ($61.3 billion) in the year-ended June 2020 compared with an earlier forecast for a surplus.
In a harbinger of worse to come, the shortfall is projected to further widen to A$184.5 billion in 2020-21, the largest since World War Two as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), mainly owing to government stimulus of around A$289 billion.
Despite the largesse, real GDP likely contracted by 7% in the June quarter as the coronavirus-driven lockdowns wreaked havoc on businesses and day-to-day life, sending the economy spiralling into recession for the first time since 1991.
""These harsh numbers reflect the harsh reality we face,"" Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra. ""The economic outlook remains very uncertain.""
Economic data suggests activity has picked up in the current quarter as anti-virus restrictions have broadly been eased across most of Australia since late May.
However, it will be some time before the economy starts firing on all cylinders, especially as the country's second most populous state of Victoria is in a lockdown again battling a second wave of infections.
""Recent events in Victoria are...a painful reminder how a setback in combating the virus can impact the speed and the trajectory of our national economic recovery,"" Frydenberg said.
The lockdown in Victoria is expected to drag on September quarter GDP by an estimated 0.75%.
Australia's benchmark share index (AXJO) edged up following Frydenberg's announcement as investor focus remained on policymakers' response to the pandemic.
It was last up 0.3%, while the Australian dollar held at $0.7137 , having climbed 2% so far this week to a 16-month peak at $0.7184. [AUD/] 
""The economic impact from COVID-19 is so far worse than that of World War Two, but what’s more important for markets is retaining momentum in the economy and ensuring the most accommodative business conditions, so that we can keep as many businesses trading through this slump,"" said AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital Australian Equities Portfolio Manager Dermot Ryan.
SECOND WAVE
The Treasurer predicted the unemployment rate would rise further to peak at around 9.25% in the fourth quarter from a 22-year high of 7.4% in June, and stay elevated beyond 2020.
Net debt is expected to be A$488.2 billion, or 24.6% of GDP at 30 June 2020 and jump to A$677.1 billion, or 35.7% of GDP by mid-2021.
The dour outlook was unlikely to hurt Australia's 'AAA' rating on its own, S&P said in a statement, though the threat of a downgrade still loomed large.
""Risks to our rating remain tilted toward the downside as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and government responses on the economy, budget, and financial markets evolve,"" S&P said.
""We believe that second waves of COVID-19 infections could strike other parts of the country, though other states have been effective in containing the spread so far,"" S&P added.

Australia has been able to contain the virus much better than most of it rich world peers, so far reporting over 13,300 coronavirus cases, with more than half in Victoria, and 133 deaths.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Pacific island nation of Tonga has asked Beijing to restructure its large bilateral debt load, the government said on Thursday, as the pandemic upends the region's tourism revenues and an onerous Chinese loan repayment schedule looms.
Tonga is one of the biggest Chinese debtors in the South Pacific, with its financial reliance dating back to loans taken more than a decade ago to rebuild its capital, Nuku’alofa, after riots.
The small economy, largely dependent on external aid and remittances from Tongans living abroad, has since taken out additional loans.
Tonga is due to make small principal repayments to the Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM) this financial year before the schedule ramps up in 2023-2024, when it will need to set aside about 15% of revenue to service external debts.
""Government is putting in place a strategy to prepare for future payment of these EXIM loans while noting that it has further requested a restructure of both loans,"" the government said in a budget statement.
Tonga's government did not respond to questions. Two sources with knowledge of its financial position told Reuters it had asked for the debt to be cancelled, but had yet to receive Beijing's response.
The foreign ministry in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tonga has previously got reprieves on the timing of principal repayments, though the debt has remained outstanding. Its total external debt stands at $186 million, with almost two-thirds owed to China, the budget statement shows.
The United States and its Western allies worry that China is using debt to secure influence over strategically located Pacific islands, claims China has repeatedly denied.
In February, the International Monetary Fund said that despite recent prudent management, Tonga's risk of external debt distress was high due to past borrowing.
With no confirmed coronavirus infections, Tonga has been easing internal controls, though travel restrictions around the world have devastated the tourism industry in the Pacific.
""Most money coming into Tonga at the moment is through remittance,"" said Simana Kami, owner of the Oholei Beach Resort, adding that most of his customers arrived on cruise ships or via international flights.
""Those without relatives earning an income overseas are suffering,"" he told Reuters by telephone. ""We are open, but not at breakeven. It's sad, we are an empty paradise.""

The lender has just provided $4.7 billion to fund a Mozambican gas project -- the largest share of about $15 billion raised for the development.
The deal helped secure U.S. jobs and displaced earlier financing efforts by China and Russia, according to Stephen Renna, Exim’s chief banking officer.
“China is our competitor and one that we want to compete with to win,” he said. “We do have a mandate from Congress to emphasize what we can do in sub-Saharan Africa so we’re clearly open for business there.”
The investment comes as tensions between Washington and Beijing escalate amid a bruising trade war and President Donald Trump’s orders to end Hong Kong’s special status and sanction Chinese officials responsible for clamping down on dissent in the city.
Africa Starts to Have Second Thoughts About That Chinese Money
China is Africa’s biggest trading partner, with two-way flows totaling more than $180 billion -- almost four times that of America. Over the past decade, Exim has authorized about $12.4 billion for U.S. exports to sub-Saharan Africa, the lender said in February.
Exim became fully functional again after being reauthorized in December, with the mandate to offer loans that rival rates and terms offered by China. At least $27 billion of the agency’s total financing has been directed toward this purpose.
The bank’s board quorum was also re-established in May last year after more than three years during which it was unable to approve transactions greater than $10 million.
‘Push Back’
Exim first approved the loan for the Mozambique liquefied natural gas project when it was led by Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC). Though it was later sold on to French oil major Total SA (NYSE:TOT), the project will still support U.S. companies that have been awarded contracts worth billions of dollars to help build the facility that by the bank’s count could back 16,700 American jobs.
Beating Chinese banks outright may not always be so clear cut.  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). is planning to develop a facility next to Total’s, with China National Petroleum Corp. as one of its partners.
Africa’s Biggest Investment Takes Shape Amid Islamist Threat (1)
The participation of the state-owned Chinese company may not prohibit Exim from supporting the project, even though the goal is to “push back” against China, Renna said. Exxon did have an application with the bank before it was withdrawn when a final investment decision was delayed.
Exim has provided financing for a rural electrification project in Senegal. Solar and storage projects could also see funding, though Renna notes the bank is not the policy arm of the government and doesn’t choose the projects pro-actively.
In addition to power developments, there’s also a focus on telecommunications where concerns over new technology is increasing, according to Renna.
“A number of African governments have reached out and said: ‘We want to turn away from China, we’re concerned about the security of the information in our system,’” he said. “Alternatives have to bring financing and so that’s where we’re trying to step up and step in.”

The extra money will be used to help businesses with temporary layoffs and liquidity and provide subsidies to local and regional authorities, the government said.
As the first European economy crippled by the virus, Italy is under pressure to increase spending to ignite a recovery. While activity has started rebounding since the government relaxed a lockdown, there’s concern the coming months will bring more pain when aid measures expire, including a ban on firing staff and the suspension of tax and loan payments.
The government had already approved two stimulus packages worth a total of 75 billion euros. Italy expects to receive the biggest share of a 750 billion-euro recovery fund approved by European Union leaders this week.
Conte told the Senate in Rome on Wednesday that the country will benefit from total funding of 209 billion euros in grants and loans under the package.

Taiwan, whose largest trading partner is China, cut its estimate for 2020 economic growth to 1.67% in May, as the pandemic hit domestic consumption and tourism.
Taiwan's cabinet said the new extra budget, which is subject to parliamentary approval, will be used to boost sectors hit by the pandemic including fishery, tourism and aviation. 
""We hope to continue to help these sectors amid the difficult time,"" cabinet spokesman Evian Ting told reporters. 
The government has stepped up support measures in recent months and is rolling out a stimulus package it expects will eventually be worth T$1.05 trillion. It includes issuing ""stimulus coupons"" that the government said could boost consumer spending by T$100 billion this year. 
Academia Sinica, a government-backed academy, said this month the island's economy could recover gradually in the second half but that the escalating U.S.-China tension was a major concern.

Taiwan has kept the pandemic well in hand with only 8 active cases and no local transmission for more than three months due to early and effective prevention work and a strong public health system.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Big data is providing some surprising results for the Bank of Japan and helping ease concerns about pressure on the economy during the coronavirus pandemic, which could influence the way the BOJ manages the world's most radical monetary stimulus.
By tapping data provided by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) showing people's movement via mobile phones, the BOJ found that households' discretionary spending rebounded faster and more vividly in Japan than in other countries after lockdown steps were lifted in May.
Other big data also showed a marked rebound in durable goods sales such as personal computers, which offset some of the weakness in spending on services including leisure, eating-out and travel.
The revelation helped convince BOJ policymakers to conclude the economy has past the worst and did not need immediate, additional monetary support.
""We expect the economy to recover gradually and steadily,"" BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said after the bank's decision this month to keep monetary policy steady.
""Service sectors, such as sports and other events, may not recover to pre-COVID-19 levels easily ... But consumption and production of goods have hit bottom and are now rebounding sharply,"" he said.
Long seen as one of the most conservative central banks when it comes to data, the BOJ is now marshalling a 180-member statistics team to troll through cargo freight movement, traffic data collected from smart phones and satellite images of human activity around factories, for better insights into the economy.
Non-traditional data may also affect the way the BOJ gauges success in meeting its elusive 2% inflation target.
An index tracking real-time trends using private data showed prices of some goods rose steadily even as services costs slumped, suggesting price moves may not be as deflationary as the official consumer price index (CPI) suggests.
The findings prompted the BOJ to warn in its quarterly report in July of the need to look at both the inflationary and deflationary impact COVID-19 could have on prices.
While CPI will remain the BOJ's key price gauge, its policy may become more detached from the index with more alternative information available, some analysts say.
""The BOJ knows its conventional approach of simply tracking CPI won't work. While they won't change the 2% target, they will start looking at a wider range of data,"" said Tsutomu Watanabe, a former BOJ official and a pioneer of big data in Japan.
""Policymakers will have to fully rely on big data. That's already happening across the world and will only accelerate.""

CATCHING UP
Major central banks are increasingly turning to real-time data to make quick calls on the pandemic-hit economy, as traditional indicators such as monthly retail sales and unemployment figures arrive too late to give a reliable picture of the impact of COVID-19.
The Federal Reserve has led the drive, tapping numerous high-frequency data and exploring new ways like creating online polls and an index gauging changes in human movement.
The BOJ is playing catch-up.
Last year, the bank created a task force to better reflect big data findings into its economic projections – a small but significant departure from the 140-year-old institution's traditional emphasis on theory and models.
It also introduced its version of a weekly index the New York Fed uses that combines frequently updated consumer and industrial activity data into a gauge of gross domestic product.
Kazushige Kamiyama, the BOJ's top economist who spearheaded the changes, says the bank is ready to hire and develop data scientists who can streamline data collection and analysis.
His mission is gaining steam because of the pandemic.
""In times of shock, uncertainty over the state of the economy and its outlook heightens. It's like driving without your lights on,"" Kamiyama told Reuters.
""That's when non-traditional data that gives us quick information, including high-frequency data, become really valuable."" 
Until recently, the BOJ saw no rush in embracing big data as it could rely on its vast branch network and ability to collect surveys from nearly 10,000 companies each quarter.
But the difficulty of conducting face-to-face interviews with business executives in the COVID-19 era has underscored the need to find more efficient ways to collect information.
Given the challenge of steering policy through radical and unpredictable changes caused by the pandemic, the more tools the policymakers can tap to take the economy's pulse, the better.
""Big data is useful in identifying shifts in the economic cycle, making it a critical tool in times like now,"" said Takeshi Yamaguchi, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) MUFG Securities who is a fan of high-frequency data.
The fact the BOJ is sailing into uncharted waters – not just on monetary policy but data analysis – highlights a growing view among its policymakers that more needs to be done to grasp complexities in the economy to achieve its elusive price target.
""Extremely big shocks like COVID-19 could trigger structural changes in the economy,"" Kamiyama said.

""We need to avoid being too simplistic, and try to look at the economy with a more sophisticated approach.""

9,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 10:05PM ET</span>","Mexico to boost worker pensions, strikes deal with employers","By Anthony Esposito and Sharay Angulo
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican workers will get a major boost in their retirement benefits after the government and private sector ironed out the details of a pension reform that is expected to become law by early next year, the Finance Ministry said on Wednesday.
The plan presented by Finance Minister Arturo Herrera sees pensions for the average worker rising some 40%, even as worker contributions to the pension system remain unchanged.
""This is a big, big step,"" Herrera told a regular news conference, speaking alongside President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and senior lawmakers. ""A big step in creating a system for a fair life for older people.""
Under the plan, a rare display of unity between the government of Lopez Obrador and big business, total contributions will rise to 15% of salary from 6.5% over eight years, and employer contributions to 13.87% from 5.15%.
Employers offered to absorb all the increase in contributions, the Finance Ministry's pension system chief, Carlos Noriega, told Reuters in an interview.
There will be a two-year grace period during which employer contributions will not increase, considering the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, Noriega said.
""When we identified the problem, the question was who will contribute the most? Will it be the worker, the state or the employer? ... On this occasion employers offered to absorb all the increase in contributions,"" said Noriega.
Lopez Obrador, a leftist who has vowed to reduce chronic inequality in Mexico, said that if shortcomings in a previous pension reform were not corrected, retiring workers would eventually receive only half of their final salary.
""This would keep getting worse over time,"" he said. 
The reform must be approved by Congress, which Noriega said he expected would happen by December, so that it becomes law in early 2021.
The shake-up should affect over 20 million Mexicans retirees, and will also enable savings to be invested in higher-yielding returns, Herrera said.
The goal is to move pension benefits much closer to the salaries workers earn just before they retire, he said.
Carlos Salazar, head of top Mexican business lobby CCE, backed the plan during the news conference, touting the reform's ""social dimension.""

Mexican pension funds, also known as Afores, managed some 4.3 trillion pesos ($192.60 billion) in savings at the end of June, according to government data.

10,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 09:27PM ET</span>",Australia’s Fiscal 2021 Deficit Forecast at A$184.5 Billion,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s budget deficit will blow out to a post-War record amid a surge in spending to plug a virus-induced gaping economic hole and collapse in revenue.
The underlying cash balance will be a A$184.5 billion ($131.6 billion) shortfall in the 12 months through June 30, 2021, the government said in an economic and fiscal update released in Canberra Thursday. The deficit in the fiscal year ended last month was estimated at A$85.8 billion.
“These harsh numbers reflect the harsh reality we face. The economic outlook remains very uncertain. Recent events in Victoria are testament to this,” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters after the release. “These deficits reveal the real cost to the budget of protecting lives and livelihoods from the coronavirus.”
The government is making vast outlays to mitigate the impact of the virus. Having initially looked to bring it under control, Australia is now battling a spike in Victoria that has forced around 5 million people in the state capital back into lockdown. The impact on Victoria, which contributes about one-quarter of gross domestic product, is set to exacerbate the shock to the economy and nation’s finances.
Despite the burgeoning budget deficit, and net debt predicted to hit A$677.1 billion in 2020-21, at 35.7% of GDP, Australia’s balance sheet is comparable with developed world nations.
The Australian dollar was little changed 71.36 U.S. cents at 11.05 a.m. in Sydney. Yields on 10-year bonds were down 2 basis points at 0.87% while three-year yields traded unchanged 0.28%, compared with the central bank’s target of 0.25%.
The currency has climbed about 30% from its March low and overseas funds have shown a healthy appetite Australia’s debt, suggesting that despite the huge budget deficit, the nation is coping relatively well with the impact of the virus.
Other data in the report showed:
Australia suffered its worst day of coronavirus infections on Wednesday, with Victoria recording 484 new cases and warning numbers could rise further. New South Wales recorded 16 new cases in the past 24 hours, and Queensland 1, pushing the national tally past 500 and breaking the previous record of 469 cases set on March 28 during the height of the first outbreak.
The government is attempting to buttress the economy as the Victoria outbreak prolongs state border closures and drags on activity. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced Tuesday that the government will pump a further A$20 billion into supporting the jobs market as it extended a signature wage subsidy and additional benefits for the unemployed.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economy will rebound in coming months as life returns to some sort of normal, though much depends on whether authorities can keep a lid on new coronavirus outbreaks in its two biggest cities, a Reuters poll found. 
The latest Reuters poll predicted Australia's A$2 trillion ($1.43 trillion) of annual gross domestic product (GDP) would still shrink a stark 3.8% for 2020 as a whole, and suffer its first recession since 1991.
Yet the economy is predicted to expand 1.3% this quarter and next, following an expected 7.0% slide in the June quarter when much of the economy was locked down.
Growth of 3.1% in 2021 was the median forecast in the July 13-21 poll of 35 analysts, though it will likely be a couple of years before all the COVID-19-related losses are made up.
Australia had been more successful than many of its peers in containing the virus and re-opening its economy, but suffered a setback this month when Melbourne had to be locked down again to combat a fresh outbreak.
A small number of new cases have also appeared in Sydney, threatening to stall the recovery.
Crucially, the government responded by extending key job support programmes by another six months to the end of March, so avoiding what analysts had feared would be a ""fiscal cliff"" for the economy in September.
""At an aggregate level the reduction in household income from job losses has been more than offset by an increase in government benefit payments,"" said Gareth Aird, CBA's head of Australian economics.
""This means there has been a positive shock to household income despite the economy being in recession. It now looks like household income will be well supported right through until March.""
The cost will be government borrowings of hundreds of billions of dollars, but so far demand for the debt has been strong and bond yields remain close to historic lows.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is doing its part by pledging to keep rates at a record low of 0.25% for years to come, while providing cheap funding to banks.
Analysts doubt all this stimulus will be any threat to inflation, with forecasts for consumer prices more than halved to just 0.6% for 2020 and trimmed to 1.6% for 2021. In April the respective forecasts were for 1.5% and 2.0%.

Republicans and the White House reached agreement Wednesday evening on the spending portion of their stimulus plan, a breakthrough that will help clear the way for McConnell to offer “a handful of bills” that will form the virus relief package designed to kick-start bipartisan talks, said Missouri Senator Roy Blunt, a member of the GOP leadership.
“It will probably be several bills that come together as a package,” Blunt told reporters after a meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. “They will all be available tomorrow, or maybe a little later than tomorrow. But the goal is tomorrow.”
Mnuchin and Meadows have been meeting with Republican senators to reconcile differences within the party about what to include in their counterproposal to Democrats, who’ve put a $3.5 trillion virus relief plan on the table. Other key parts of the package have yet to be resolved, including plans to extend expiring unemployment benefits.
President Donald Trump and Congress are facing a narrow window to keep the economic damage from the resurgent pandemic from worsening before the November election. Programs in the last stimulus, passed in March, are beginning to expire and lawmakers are scheduled to leave town for an August break in less than three weeks.
Mnuchin said the administration and Senate Republicans are “completely on the same page,” and Meadows expressed optimism the deal with bolster chances of a final bill that reaches the White House.
“I think we feel very good at where we’ve ended up with numbers,” Meadows said. “We’re looking forward to passing a bill and getting across the finish line.”
Among the provisions are another round of direct payments to individuals, $105 billion in aid for schools including those that reopen classrooms and $25 billion to expand virus testing.
None of those involved in Wednesday’s meeting, including Mnuchin and Meadows, mentioned the payroll tax holiday that Trump has said he wants in the package.
It’s not clear whether McConnell will try to call a vote on the GOP plan or go straight into negotiations on a compromise plan with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. Any final plan will need the support of Democrats to pass the House and Senate.

ROME (Reuters) - The Italian government approved 25-billion euros ($28.93 billion) of extra spending late on Wednesday, the third major cash injection to try to support its battered economy since the start of the country's coronavirus outbreak.
The new stimulus is seen pushing Italy’s 2020 budget deficit near 12% of national output, compared with a 10.4% goal set in April and the 1.6% reported in 2019, which was the lowest in 12 years.
It will help tide Italy over while it awaits more than 200 billion euros in grants and cheap loans from the European Union's Recovery Fund, which EU leaders approved this week.
""The new package will amount to 25 billion euros,"" Regional Affairs Minister Francesco Boccia said after ministers approved the extra borrowing at a meeting that ended around midnight local time.
The government has said it will present the measures in an emergency decree early in August, following a parliamentary vote on July 29 to authorise the deficit hike.
Speaking in Parliament earlier on Wednesday, Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said part of the extra spending would be used to allow people to pay taxes in instalments rather than in a single payment that is currently due in September.
The package will conditionally extend financing for temporary layoff schemes for an additional 18 weeks, a government source said. Companies hit hardest in the first half of 2020 will be entitled to extend the scheme provided they do not reduce their workforce.
The decree will also include new tax breaks to encourage companies to bring furloughed employees back to work, Deputy Economy Minister Antonio Misiani said.
The new stimulus measures come on top of the 75 billion euros Rome has already deployed to help businesses and families.

Overall, the government has set aside some 180 billion euros, including state guarantees for bank loans, though only part of this is expected to be spent.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina could cede ground to creditors on key legal terms as it looks to strike a deal to restructure around $65 billion in foreign debt, but the government will not increase overall cash flow in the payout, two sources told Reuters.
The South American country is facing a standoff with bondholders after creditor groups joined forces to reject the government's proposal this week and put forward one of their own. The government has repeatedly said it cannot offer more.
However, two sources close to the talks said the government may be willing to bend on some of the demands in the joint creditor counterproposal as long as it did not involve increasing the cash flow in any final deal.
Argentina's Economy Ministry declined to comment.
Creditors' legal demands include that amendments be made to the 2016 indenture for new debt issued in exchange for 'Macri' bonds, to prevent the government from using 'Pac-Man' style measures to make future changes to any agreement.
""Argentina might be willing to identify which are the pain points around legal clauses, which is creating tension and noise within the investors' community,"" one source close to the talks said, declining to be named as the negotiations are private.
Talks to identify where concessions could potentially be made were taking place, the person added, and there may be room to ""shift and twist"" the existing Argentinian proposal to increase the net present value (NPV) without putting in more money.
""So I think that there could be flexibility but not on the real cash flow.""
A second source, a person close to the talks and familiar with government thinking, said in economic terms the current government offer was final, though there may be some leeway on legal clauses.
""In legal terms, Argentina could make modifications if a consensus emerges that the existing model clauses are somehow flawed,"" the person said. ""There will be no changes to NPV, unless the creditors realize that after the restructuring Argentina merits a discount rate of less than 10%.""
Despite digging in heels, analysts say a gap of about 3 cents on the dollar between the sides at the negotiating table should be bridged in last-ditch talks ahead of a current Aug. 4 deadline for a deal to avoid a messy legal standoff.
That has helped push up Argentine bond prices, which rose an average 1.8% on Wednesday.
Argentina has been in default since May, the country's ninth, and is headed for 10-12% economic contraction this year due to the impact of COVID-19, deepening a recession since 2018.
Siobhan Morden at Amherst Pierpont said a compromise solution would be a win-win for Argentina that would give it substantial cash flow relief and allow focus to turn to domestic debt markets and negotiations with the IMF.

""It's almost incomprehensible for Argentina to choose another alternative,"" she wrote in a note.

Japan will still mark the day originally scheduled for the opening ceremony with a national holiday. But there will be little to celebrate amid continued uncertainty over the feasibility of a revamped staging of the Games next year.
Dylan Crain, a resident of Tampa, Florida who had tickets to attend Friday’s opening event, said he’d be less willing to go to a Games currently rescheduled to start on July 23, 2021.
“We’d meticulously made a timeline, set up everything and were happy with our accommodations,” said Crain, who helped plan the trip for a group of 12. “Now, rescheduling all of that, in a compressed timeline with so many people, it’s hard to justify that. Not sure everyone would even feel safe.”
The government had expected the Games to fuel a surge in overseas visitors to 40 million this year; now, it may not even reach 5 million. Spending by overseas visitors will be a fraction of the 4.8 trillion yen ($44.7 billion) in 2019, with the failed Olympic bet threatening to re-entrench Japanese firms’ conservative stance on investment.
“This was supposed to be the busiest time for us ever,” said Naoyuki Fukuuchi, managing director at Japan Hotel Association. “Instead, we are in a dire situation like never before.”
In a central bank survey earlier this month, sentiment among large hotel and restaurant owners nosedived to a record low of -91, the worst among any business category. Zero marks the dividing line between optimism and pessimism.
A number of big hotel chains including Prince Hotels & Resorts have delayed opening new facilities. A third of the 620,000 workers in the hotel industry were still on leave as of May, according to the ministry of internal affairs. But even with staff furloughed, some hotels haven’t had the reserves to weather the storm.
The White Bear Family Co. and its group companies, which ran hotels and sold travel packages, filed for bankruptcy protection with 35 billion yen in debt, a record case for Japan’s tourism industry, according to research firm Teikoku Databank.
Excessive competition in the Kansai region around Osaka and Kyoto and a drop in Korean and Chinese visitors amid political tensions had already made business hard, said Takuya Mori, an attorney at Kikkawa Law Offices in Osaka who represents WBF Hotels and Resorts.
“The coronavirus was the final blow and funds just ran out,” he added.
As part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s collection of virus-response measures worth more than 40% of gross domestic product, the government has tried to focus some of its help on a tourism industry in distress, through a domestic travel program.
Japan Travel Campaign Delivers Double Whammy to Tokyo Residents
But looking beyond this summer, analysts see tourism recovering at a slow pace as Covid-19 keeps travelers wary. For would-be Olympic watchers, the dilemma is whether to hold on to tickets for a scaled-down Games next year, assuming the event will be held at all.
Life Altering
Victor Warren, who played hockey for Canada at the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games, had planned to attend the Games this year with a fellow Olympian from 56 years ago, John McBryde, who won a bronze medal with the Australian hockey team.
Warren, 82, is determined to attend next year, come what may. “The Games are a life-altering experience, and something one will never forget,” he said.
But others have scrapped travel plans altogether. Emma Chirnside, a 29-year-old market researcher in Sydney, and her boyfriend had planned to come with another couple to root for a friend on Australia’s womens’ water polo team.
“Once we went into lockdown in Sydney it was like, no, we’re not doing this,” Chirnside said.

Mortgage rates fell below 3% last week and have continued lower, with the potential fall as low as 2%, Bespoke said in a note to clients.
""The implication is that the cost of home ownership is plunging and likely to fall further over coming months, fueling substantial activity in the housing market as the economy rebounds,"" the note said.
U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell below 3% for the first time in records going back nearly 50 years last week, according to data released by  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) on Thursday.
The sharp decline in mortgage rates comes as investors rush into safe-haven assets, such as U.S. Treasuries, which have been trading near all-time lows, while the Federal Reserve has signaled it will keep rates low in response to the coronavirus pandemic by purchasing Treasuries and other bonds.
Mortgage rates are likely to fall to 2.75% before they bottom, said Douglas Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae in an interview.
""If you're a salaried person that's pretty confident of your job, it's a pretty good time to buy a house,"" he said.
""If you are a pristine credit I'm sure you will be able to get a rate below 2.75%,” he added.

The experience for mortgage bond holders has been ""brutal,"" as large amounts of principle on higher-yielding mortgages are being paid back ahead of schedule due to refinancing, causing the duration of cash flows in mortgage bonds with higher coupons to decline rapidly, Bespoke said.

DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will look to sell assets in sectors not previously considered for privatisation, the country's finance minister said on Wednesday, as the country contends with the economic impact of sustained low oil prices.
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, is facing a sharp recession because of the coronavirus crisis and depleted oil revenues. 
The International Monetary Fund has forecast a 6.8% contraction this year, but Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said at Bloomberg event that he expects the economy to contract less than that.
""A lot of factors work in our favour ... local and domestic tourism for example is picking up very nicely this month,"" he said.
Saudi Arabia has planned a series of privatisations in recent years, including the initial public offering of state-owned oil giant Aramco (SE:2222), which took place last year.
""We're looking at sectors that haven't been targeted before for privatisation,"" Jadaan said, mentioning healthcare and education. 
Asked how much revenue privatisations would generate, he said the sale of assets would generate more than 50 billion riyals in the next four to five years.
The prospects for economic recovery were brightened by some promising July data, though the pandemic makes for an uncertain outlook, he added.
Saudi Arabia tripled its value-added tax to 15% this month as part of efforts to bolster state coffers. Though Jadaan said there are no imminent plans to introduce an income tax, he added that nothing could be ruled out.
Later on Wednesday state news agency (SPA) quoted an unnamed Saudi official as saying that the issue has not been discussed by the Cabinet or any government committee.
“This topic is not a matter of discussion,” the source added. 
International debt investors are likely to be tapped by Saudi Arabia once again this year, Jadaan said, but no decision has been taken on the currency of the planned issuance.

Saudi Arabia, which has raised $12 billion from international bond issues this year, has increased local debt issuance significantly from its original plans, the minister said.

(Reuters) - The Paycheck Protection Program, a stimulus effort intended to serve as a lifeline for the nation's smallest employers, helped to save about 2.3 million jobs through the first week of June, according to a paper co-authored by economists at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and ADP Research Institute.
The program, created as part of the CARES Act in late March, had funneled more $518 billion in aid to small businesses as of mid-July. Firms with fewer than 500 employees can have their loans forgiven if they retain a certain share of employees and meet other requirements.
The researchers compared hiring trends at companies that were eligible for the program to those that were too large to qualify. They found that hiring at eligible companies rose after the launch of PPP when compared to companies that did not qualify.
The small business aid lifted employment at qualifying companies by between 2% and 4.5%, the researchers found. That amounted to about 2.3 million jobs protected, according to the central estimate provided in the study.
It is difficult to know exactly how many jobs were saved by the program, the researchers noted, since some employers may have held on to their workers even without the assistance.
Some policymakers have raised questions about whether PPP funds were distributed efficiently and fairly to businesses in need. Many lenders restricted early applications to existing customers, making it difficult for some of the smallest businesses - including minority-owned businesses in areas hit hard by the virus - to access the aid.
Lawmakers are currently debating a fourth aid package to support households and small businesses affected by the pandemic, including a potential boost to the PPP program. But Democrats and Republicans need to overcome significant differences over the scale and focus of the response.

20,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 04:05PM ET</span>","China's CRRC should be sanctioned by U.S., lobby groups say","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. rail, steel and manufacturing groups are calling on the Trump administration to use its most powerful sanctioning tool against China's CRRC after the Pentagon announced the world's largest maker of passenger trains was backed by the Chinese military. 
In a letter sent on Tuesday, the Rail Security Alliance, the United Steelworkers and others urged U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) against the company, which has clinched key passenger rail contracts in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles by underbidding rivals. 
The law allows the administration to kick a company out of the U.S. banking system, bar American firms or citizens from trading or conducting financial transactions with the sanctioned party, and freezes assets held in the United States. 
""We write to encourage the imposition of immediate, meaningful, and permanent sanctions on CRRC for the continued protection of the economic and national security of the United States,"" said the letter, which was also signed by the American Foundry Society, the American Iron and Steel Institute and the Alliance for American Manufacturing. 
The letter comes amid rising tensions between Beijing and Washington over the deadly coronavirus pandemic and China's move to curb freedoms in Hong Kong.
The U.S. Defense Department last month released a list of 20 companies, including CRRC, allegedly owned or controlled by the Chinese military, or People's Liberation Army. The list was mandated by a 1999 law that gives the president the option of imposing IEEPA penalties against listed firms. 
""Now is the time for the Administration to take immediate action against CRRC, which has been declared to be under the control of the PLA and which has demonstrated itself to be working against our national interests,"" the groups said.
CRRC representatives and the Treasury Department did not respond to requests for comment. 
The Rail Security Alliance, a freight lobbying group made up of manufacturers, suppliers, and steel workers, was formed 4-1/2 years ago to oppose CRRC’s rapid expansion in the U.S. passenger rail market.
While there are no U.S. passenger-car builders, CRRC’s success has fueled a backlash by American freight companies, which fear the company will encroach on the country’s far bigger freight car market.

A law passed last year bars federal funds from going to Chinese state-owned companies such as CRRC.

Chief Executive Officer David Solomon threw his weight behind more spending to help revive the economy as congressional leaders remain deadlocked on a new stimulus deal.
“Even though it’s hard and it’s expensive, we are better to blunt the economic impact now in the short term, by spending more, than to allow it to get worse and deal with the consequences of it being worse,” Solomon said Wednesday in an online presentation hosted by the Economic Club of New York.
Trump administration officials and Senate Republicans are discussing a short-term extension of unemployment insurance, though lawmakers and the White House appear unlikely to reach a broader stimulus deal before existing benefits lapse. The White House’s goal is to unveil a new stimulus package by the end of next week.
Extraordinary spending measures by the federal government have helped support households across the country dealing with fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, including millions of lost jobs. The Federal Reserve’s unprecedented intervention has helped markets snap back from their March lows.
The measures also meant financial firms regained their footing much faster than the real economy has. Wall Street’s five biggest investment banks earlier this month disclosed $45 billion in revenue from trading and dealmaking units, marking those businesses’ best quarter ever. The stimulus handed a bonanza to trading desks and propelled Goldman Sachs to its second-highest quarterly revenue on record.
Solomon warned that while more spending would be needed, it will translate into slower growth and a bigger economic burden in the future, with fallout that could include the risk of a weakening dollar.
“There’s real consequence to this,” he said. “There’s no free lunch. And unfortunately we’re going to live with the consequences for quite some time.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A leading U.S. banking regulator said on Wednesday that national banks may provide custody services for cryptocurrencies.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said in a new letter that providing custody and safekeeping services for cryptocurrencies, including holding ""keys"" needed to access cryptocurrency holdings, is a modern version of traditional banking activities and should be allowed.
""From safe-deposit boxes to virtual vaults, we must ensure banks can meet the financial services needs of their customers today,” said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks in a statement.
The new OCC opinion provides further entry for traditional banks into the cryptocurrency business, where the rules have been murky about what is and isn't permitted.
Prior to joining the OCC, Brooks served as the chief legal officer for Coinbase, a crypto exchange. Brooks took over as acting head of the federal agency in May.
In its opinion letter, the OCC said protecting access to cryptocurrencies falls within ""longstanding authorities to engage in safekeeping and custody activities"" for banks.
Banks can provide such business to customers with cryptocurrencies, so long as they ensure they are following relevant laws, including those pertaining to money laundering. The OCC said banks considering this business should discuss the matter with regulators before launching it.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are piling into haven assets such as gold, the Swiss franc and cash as U.S. stocks approach all-time highs, looking to hedge big moves in equities amid economic uncertainty and a resurgent coronavirus pandemic. 
Prices for gold are up 22% this year and stand near record levels, as the metal draws investors seeking shelter from a potential reversal in stocks. The Swiss franc is among the year’s best performing currencies and allocations to cash remain historically elevated.
The rallies in these assets - which tend to attract demand in uncertain times - have taken place alongside a nearly 50% climb in the S&P 500 from its 2020 lows, illustrating the conundrum many investors have faced in recent months.
While sitting on the sidelines has proven a disastrous strategy as stocks rallied, many have become unsettled by stretched equity valuations and a coronavirus resurgence that has all but extinguished hopes of a quick U.S. economic recovery. The S&P recently traded at 3,268, less than 5% shy of its Feb. 24 record high.
""The easy trade isn't putting money in equities anymore,"" said Jim Besaw, chief investment officer at GenTrust. ""The market might have gotten a little bit ahead of itself.""
The firm has increased exposure to gold in clients' portfolios with the gold allocation on average tripling since April to as much as mid-single digits as a percentage of portfolios. GenTrust has also been trimming positions in technology stocks.
Meanwhile, a coronavirus resurgence in parts of the United States is heightening concerns that risk appetite could dry up if some states are forced to roll back their economic reopenings.
Only 14% of fund managers in a July survey from BofA Global Research believe the recovery will be a quick, “V-shaped"" one, down from 18% last month. Cash levels among investors remain high on a historic basis, at 4.9%, the survey showed. 
“After a spectacular spring for risk assets … we recommend applying plenty of protection,"" said Kit Juckes, chief global FX strategist at Société Générale, in a note. 
He recommends buying gold, as the metal's prices have risen during August in 15 of the last 20 years, according to the bank's data. The bank also advises clients to buy the Japanese yen, another popular haven, as a hedge against potential volatility.
Other factors have also driven the moves in havens. Gold, which normally struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets, has become more attractive to investors after the Federal Reserve cut rates to historic lows. Gold has also drawn investors worried that unprecedented levels of stimulus could cause inflation to rise. Investors have also piled into inflation-protected bonds as a hedge. 
""What's driving markets right now is Fed action,"" said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Wealth Management. Her firm added gold to its asset allocation models in April. 
Haven currencies, meanwhile, have been helped by a falling dollar. The U.S. dollar index (DXY) is down 8% from its March highs.
Some believe caution amid a big stock rally is a sign that investors haven't become overly ebullient despite the recent gains, and may sell their haven assets to buy equities if prices become more attractive. Worries over valuations were a regular feature of the last bull market, which saw the S&P gain around 400%. 
Still, investors like Jeroen Blokland, portfolio manager at Robeco, now see more value outside of equities. Blokland's firm is betting against U.S. stocks while holding positions in high-yield bonds, commodities and the euro. 
His concerns include potential volatility stemming from the U.S. presidential election. 

""Once we get this hiccup, it will be equities that will show that hiccup,"" he said.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's cherished saying that there is ""a bar on every corner"" is in jeopardy with 85,000 drinking and eating establishments facing closure if a coronavirus rebound gets out of control.
That was the warning from the main hospitality business lobby, which said some 40,000 bars and restaurants had already shut down permanently in tourism-dependent Spain which implemented one of Europe's toughest lockdowns. 
The Spanish Hospitality Industry Association added that in a best-case scenario, 25,000 more were likely to close by year end, with another 20,000 if spikes were not contained. 
Spaniards and foreign tourists have not been drinking and eating out as much as usual when lockdown ended last month.
""In many cases the heart has been more powerful than the head and many of the businesses opened their doors while losing money,"" association president Jose Luis Yzuel told Reuters on Wednesday.
""How long can (owners) maintain that?"" he said, estimating that revenues for the sector were set to halve in 2020, with losses of around 67 billion euros ($77.49 billion).
NO TAX CUT 
Spain, which has suffered more than 28,400 deaths and about 266,000 cases of the COVID-19 disease, has seen a sharp rise in new infections over the last three weeks, but still at a level well below the peak. 
Several business groups have created a lobby campaign ""Together for hospitality"" to seek help for a sector that accounts for about 6.2% of GDP and employs 1.7 million people. 
Among their demands are a temporary cut in value-added tax and help for micro businesses, as up to 70% of the sector are self-employed or have less than three workers.
But on Wednesday, Industry and Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto ruled out a VAT cut. 
""It's not on the agenda at the moment because it involves a very important budgetary effort and the needs we have to support the various economic sectors are enormous,"" he said.

The 750 billion-euro ($868 billion) stimulus deal struck by European Union governments this week “is clearly a demonstration of solidarity, of transfer to those that need it most,” she said in a Washington Post Live event on Wednesday.
The allocation of loans and grants in the package is a “good balance,” Lagarde said. “It could have been better, but it’s a very ambitious project actually.”
The comments suggest similar concerns to those European Union governments who advocated for a larger share of grants in the recovery fund, arguing that more debt would be difficult for some member states. While the initial proposal foresaw 500 billion euros in grants and 250 billion euros in loans, the final version lowered the level of grants to 390 billion euros.

The package has nonetheless been widely praised by policy makers and investors for sending a signal on the region’s common resolve and providing a fiscal reinforcement to the ECB’s efforts to shore up growth. The central bank, for its part, has pledged to spend well over a trillion euros on emergency asset purchases across the next year, and is expected to boost support again in coming months.
While some ECB officials have pointed to the possibility of the euro area’s contraction turning out less severe than initially anticipated, Lagarde stressed that prospects for a recovery are still “uneven” and “uncertain.”
Recent figures on the economy suggest the ECB’s baseline forecast for a contraction of nearly 9% this year “is probably in the right place.”

The accord, struck on Tuesday after fraught negotiations, will see the European Commission disburse 390 billion in grants and 360 billion in cheap loans to member countries based on criteria including their unemployment rate in recent years and, later, the economic damage wrought by the pandemic.
But Lagarde stood out as a rare critic, saying she would have preferred a greater proportion of grants over loans, in line with the Commission's original proposal that was changed to convince fiscally frugal countries such as the Netherlands. 
""It could have been better but it’s a very ambitious project,"" Lagarde told a live-streamed interview with the Washington Post.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's travel ban aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus has hit most European firms in the country and could prompt them to rethink their future in the world's third-largest economy, a European business lobby said on Wednesday.
Many countries have imposed travel curbs amid the pandemic, but Japan's are among the strictest, effectively banning entry to tourists and visa holders coming from 129 countries. 
Even permanent residents are not allowed in unless they are granted an exception on humanitarian grounds. In the United States and Europe, in contrast, non-citizen residents are allowed to return.
A recent survey by the European Business Council of 376 members in Japan showed that 85% had been negatively impacted by the ban, with 44% reporting financial losses. The EBC said the travel restrictions run counter to international treaties.
""This situation may also trigger some investment disputes against Japan,"" EBC president Michael Mroczek told reporters.
The way the ban was handled creates an air of unpredictability that may cause CEOs to ""rethink their policy regarding Japan,"" he said.
Japan allows its citizens to return to the country if they take a coronavirus test at the port of entry and observe a period of self-quarantine. 
Foreigners living in Japan face much higher hurdles for re-entry, such as demonstrating the need to visit dying relatives or be reunited with family in the country.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe tweeted on Wednesday that Japan would gradually begin allowing foreign residents with re-entry permits to re-enter the country. Kyodo news said the measure would apply to foreign students and employees of foreign companies.
It was not immediately clear whether the relaxed rules would apply to foreign workers at Japanese companies or to permanent residence holders. Foreign ministry officials were not immediately available for comment.
The EBC's remarks echoed those of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan (ACCJ), which has decried the country's ""double standard"" in reentry requirements.
Restrictions to contain the spread of the virus have already helped tip Japan's economy into its first recession in 4-1/2 years, as the country tries to stave off a second wave of infections which has brought total cases there to more than 25,000.

Seade helped found the WTO in the early 1990s and led his government's negotiating team to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement. The veteran negotiator also previously worked at the International Monetary Fund and at universities in Hong Kong.
He said the next chief needed to combine depth of understanding of trade issues with the political clout needed to ""get the WTO out of the hole"" it is in. While there is no formal regional rotation requirement, some say that coming from Mexico might be a disadvantage since Azevedo was from the Americas.
Hamid Mamdouh (Egypt), 67, currently Geneva-based lawyer
Former trade negotiator for Egypt and ex-WTO official who helped draft an agreement on trade in services in the landmark Uruguay Round deal - an experience that he said gave him essential ""bridge-building"" skills. 
Mamdouh, who was officially endorsed by the African Union, is currently advising G20 president Saudi Arabia on trade matters and vows to ""immediately revive the negotiating function of the organisation"" if chosen. Some delegates say a lack of political experience could be a handicap but he denies this.
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala (Nigeria), 66, board chair of the global vaccine alliance Gavi
Okonjo-Iweala, one of three women and three Africans in the race, is an economist and development specialist who has served as Nigeria's foreign minister and finance minister and as a managing director of the World Bank. Branding herself a ""do-er"", she points to her strong negotiating skills including a deal to cancel billions of dollars of Nigerian debt. 
Described by some as one of top candidates, she told Reuters she has ""strong support"" from the continent. [L8N2DZ3ER] [L8N2E663I]
Tudor Ulianovschi (Moldova), 37, former minister of foreign affairs 
Ulianovschi, the youngest candidate, was foreign minister in 2018-2019 and formerly a diplomat, with a 2016-2018 posting as Moldovan ambassador in Switzerland, covering also the WTO.
He said his immediate priority as chief would be to work towards a multilateral trade deal at the 2021 ministerial conference. 
Yoo Myung-hee (South Korea), 53, trade minister
South Korea's first female trade minister previously led the renegotiation of a trade deal with the United States and worked on Seoul's trade pacts.
Yoo vows to make the WTO more ""relevant, resilient and responsive"" and rebuild trust in the body.
Amina Mohamed (Kenya), 58, sport and culture minister 
Mohamed is a former Kenyan ambassador to the WTO who in 2005 was the first woman to chair the WTO's General Council.
She ran for the top post unsuccessfully in 2013 although she says she has gained key skills since, including through chairing a Nairobi ministerial conference where deals were struck. 
She has advocated broad participation in the WTO reform process and expressed some sympathy with U.S. criticism of the body. Some delegates see her as a frontrunner.
Mohammad Al-Tuwaijri (Saudi Arabia), minister advising the royal court
Al-Tuwaijri, who studied aeronautics and business, was a Saudi Air Force pilot before working for a number of banks. He became minister of economy and state planning from 2017 until he was relieved of his post in March. He has also been on the board of directors at  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), Saudi Railways and Saudi Arabian Airlines and says his private sector experience allows him to take a ""fresh look"" at the WTO. 
Some delegates say political tensions with Qatar might prevent him earning broader support.
Liam Fox (Britain), 58, member of parliament
A former defence minister as well as an ex-doctor and staunch Eurosceptic, Fox campaigned for Britain to leave the European Union and, after the Brexit vote, became secretary of state for international trade, but lost his position a year ago.

Fox, who was given early odds of 33/1 by betting agency  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) before the vetting process began, says this is a job for a politician ""and probably one who has been around for a while and carries the scars of the most difficult battles.""

With the euro zone economy struggling under the weight of the coronavirus pandemic and associated lockdown measures, the ECB told banks in March to suspend discretionary payments such as dividends and bonuses until October, while allowing them to eat into their capital and liquidity buffers.

Both measures are set to be officially extended on Tuesday, when the ECB will also publish the results of its vulnerability assessment - an exercise estimating how euro zone banks would, on aggregate, cope with the pandemic, three sources said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will record its biggest budget deficit since World War Two, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg will say on Thursday, as the spread of COVID-19 saw the government roll out billions in stimulus to support a shuttered economy.
Detailing for the first time the full extent of the economic impact of COVID-19, Frydenberg will say government revenues have plummeted at the same time Australia channels about A$290 billion in fiscal support, extracts of the announcement seen by Reuters show.
""Our announced measures, together with large declines in taxation receipts, has seen a hit to the bottom line,"" Frydenberg will tell Australian lawmakers in Canberra.
""But this has been necessary in order to cushion the blow for millions of Australians, and to keep businesses in business and keep Australians in jobs.""
The exact size of the deficits for the financial years 2019/2020 and 2020/21 will be published later on Thursday.
Economists expect that for the year that ended on June 30, the budget deficit will top A$75 billion, or about 4% of Australia's gross domestic product.
Next year, the deficit is tipped to be in excess of A$200 billion or about 10% of GDP.
The figures could also deteriorate as Australia struggles to contain a fresh outbreak of COVID-19.
Australia on Wednesday posted its biggest one-day jump in new infections amid a surge in cases in the country's second most populous state, which ordered nearly 5 million people to stay home unless for essential reason two weeks earlier.
The figures are far cry from estimates made as recently as December, 2019.
Back then, Australia was expecting to post its first budget surplus in more than a decade.
In March, however, Australia shut its international borders and shut large swathes of its economy.
It did slow the spread of the coronavirus, but it was a hammer blow to Australia's economy, which is heading into its first recession in three decades as the unemployment rate hits a 19-year high of 7.1%.

Frydenberg will say that as a result, company tax receipts are expected to fall by more than A$25 billion between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2021.

LONDON (Reuters) - Market gauges measuring euro zone break-up risk have fallen silent after this week's deal among European leaders on a fund to tackle the coronavirus fallout, suggesting fears of another existential crisis for the currency bloc have eased.
The European Union has agreed to raise billions of euros on capital markets on behalf of all its 27 states, in an act of unprecedented solidarity.
That contrasts with the slow and disunited response when the pandemic broke out a few months ago, which raised fears of a fresh crisis that could fragment the euro area.
Here are some of the gauges which show those fears fading.
INSURANCE - LESS NEED
Italy has been the focus of markets' euro breakup fears in recent years, but its Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said the government had been strengthened by the ""historic"" EU accord.
The deal pushed the cost of insuring Italian sovereign debt against default to six-week lows. 
Significantly, the gap between Italian five-year bond yields and credit default swaps has narrowed by around 100 basis points from April levels to around 160 bps. A wide spread is a danger sign, as Italian borrowing costs can be held down by ECB purchases, but the CDS reflects investors' view of how risky they consider the debt to be.  (IT5YT=RR)
That spread blew out in April to its widest in about 18 months after joint debt issuance - which would have assured investors of Italy's creditworthiness - appeared out of reach.
Under the 750 billion euro recovery fund, Italy will receive an unprecedented 209 billion euros, of which just over 80 billion euros will be in grants. While the money will take time to arrive, the fact that it is on the way should keep anti-euro sentiment at bay.
""Italy...is now becoming a net financial beneficiary; no doubt an objective for (Angela) Merkel and (Emmanuel) Macron from the start was to help slow/stop any anti-EU movement in Italy,"" UniCredit group chief economist Erik Nielsen said.
Graphic: Lesser need for insurance? - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgpokmldpd/Pasted%20image%201595413787401.png
EURO HIGH
The easing of break-up risks is evident in the euro's rally to 18-month highs and the decline in the premium investors demand to hold southern European bonds instead of German debt - a measure of the relative risks within the bloc.
The euro has surged above $1.15 (EUR=EBS), more than 8% above March lows when the coronavirus-induced market turmoil raged.
""One of the reasons the euro could move up is euro area break-up risks calming down. When you hear Italy is on board with the recovery plan it shows Italy is in a happier place with how policymakers are treating the periphery,"" said Mohammed Kazmi, a portfolio manager at UBP.
Italy's 10-year bond yield spread over Germany is at 160 bps (DE10IT10=RR) - 70 bps tighter than it was just before the recovery fund plan was unveiled in May. Spanish and Portuguese spreads are 15-20 bps tighter.

GOOD BYE NEW YORK? 
Whenever Italy's euro zone membership is considered at risk, its dollar bonds tend to outperform its euro-denominated debt.
That's because in the event of restructuring, dollar bonds issued under New York law would offer better protection than those governed by Italian law. If Italy exits the euro, the latter would be vulnerable to redenomination into its new currency.
At 3.07%, an Italian dollar bond  maturing in 2033 traded with yields that are roughly 130 bps below March highs. But yields on a similar-maturity euro issue have slid far more - by 175 bps (IT15YT=RR).

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine's central bank is likely to cut its key interest rate from 6% on Thursday at the first monetary policy meeting since a new governor took charge promising to make loans cheaper for businesses, a regular Reuters poll showed on Wednesday. 
Seven out of 17 polled analysts expect a rate cut to 5.5%, while four others see it at 5.0%, one person forecast 5.25% and another 5.75%. Four analysts believe the rate will be unchanged.
Parliament appointed 47-year-old career banker Kyrylo Shevchenko last week after his predecessor Yakiv Smoliy quit in early July complaining of ""systematic political pressure"" on the central bank, rattling the market. 
Smoliy had brought interest rates down to their lowest level since Ukraine's independence in 1991. But critics said the pace of cuts was slow and damaged the economy as it hurtled towards recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Smoliy rejected the accusations and said he was being pressured into taking bad economic decisions.
Shevchenko pledged to continue the central bank's independent monetary policy but said rates should be lowered to make loans affordable and help restore economic growth.
Alexander Paraschiy from brokerage Concorde Capital said the central bank could cut the rate to 5.5% ""to show political loyalty"", although there was little room for a decrease as inflation was likely to accelerate later in the year.
Sergiy Nikolaychuk from brokerage ICU said a 0.25 percentage point cut is most likely.
""Current conditions allow the central bank to cut interest rate in July – September, but the central bank should decide if it is worth cutting the rate now and then resort to a sharper increase of the rate in the future,"" he said. 
Analysts for Raiffeisen Bank Aval forecast a cut to 5.0% and said it would match trends elsewhere.

""Even taking into account the increase in inflationary expectations..., the key rate reduction to 5.0% corresponds to the levels of real key rates used in the countries of Central Europe,"" they said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England may introduce more flexible rules on the capital that small banks must set aside against mortgage loans, to help them compete better in a sector that has long been dominated by Britain's big lenders.
Big banks can use their own models to determine how much to set aside against mortgage defaults, while smaller lenders must use the regulator's guidelines, which typically means holding more capital.
A simpler but still robust capital regime for smaller banks could promote competition, Sarah Breeden, the BoE's executive director for UK Deposit Takers Supervision, said.
""We are considering, in particular, whether there might be scope to introduce a new regime for smaller banks following Britain's departure from the European Union,"" Breeden said.
Her comments came in a speech released on Wednesday, as the central bank published a consultation paper setting out a more defined regulatory approach to new and growing banks, such as simpler capital calculations.
Of the 22 new banks authorised since 2013, many seemed to have underestimated what was needed to become successful, Breeden said, adding that 20 more potential UK start-up banks were in the pipeline.
Challenger Metro Bank is being investigated by the BoE over an accounting scandal.
None of the new arrivals threaten HSBC, Lloyds (LON:LLOY), RBS (LON:RBS) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC), the four major banks that dominate mortgages, deposits and business loans in Britain.
Breeden said the BoE had been reviewing how to reduce the ""unwarranted benefits"" of using models, including ""the desirability of mortgage risk weight floors.""
Not all banks want to become a big player given the extra regulatory requirements they would face.

The UK arm of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' Marcus digital bank closed to new business in June to avoid reaching a threshold that would force it to become a separate, ring-fenced entity, a costly undertaking.

(Reuters) - The surge of U.S. coronavirus cases that began in June was preceded in May by a large jump in consumer interest in social activities like dining out and going to bars and gyms, website  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP) reported on Wednesday in an analysis of searches and reviews conducted on its platform.
Justin Norman, Yelp's VP of Data Science, said in states like Florida and South Carolina, which experienced high growth in coronavirus infections in June, consumer views of Web pages or posts of photos and reviews for bars, restaurants and gyms jumped more than 50% from the previous month. (https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/YELP/xklpydkznvg/)
In New York and other northeastern states where the virus remained contained, consumer interest in those activities ""remained more flat,"" Yelp said in the latest tabulation of activity on its Web site, where users discuss and rate local businesses, particularly restaurants.
The analysis was not a rigorous study of the issue. But it suggested the raw correlation was potentially noteworthy -- another bit of evidence to suggest that the effort to return to normal life in late May and early June, after two months of national lockdown, may have fueled infections.
""Correlation and causation are not equivalent,"" Norman noted. But ""increasing consumer interest... is a good general indicator of consumer behavior reverting to the norm and a state being more active economically and socially. This general reversion toward pre-pandemic consumer behavior in
the month of May could very plausibly result in a spike in COVID-19 cases in June.""
Like many Web sites that collect user information on a continual basis, Yelp has been using it to gain insight on the coronavirus. 
As the economic reopening proceeds fitfully, with some states now restricting activity again as cases rise, what had been a steady decline the number of businesses shuttered either permanently or temporarily appears to have slowed, the company noted.
The number fell from 177,000 in mid-April to 140,000 in mid-June. As of mid-July, it was 132,500, with a rising share of about 55% apparently closed on a permanent basis.

40,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 07:01AM ET</span>",Green energy ratchets up power during coronavirus pandemic,"By Susanna Twidale
LONDON (Reuters) - Renewable power has taken up a record share of global electricity production since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a Reuters review of data, suggesting a transition away from polluting fossil fuels could be accelerated in the coming years.
Advocates of traditional energy have long argued that clean energy sources, like solar and wind farms, which depend on fickle weather, cannot be trusted to provide steady supplies of electricity into national grids that were designed to operate in tandem with reliable coal and gas generators.
But the past three months have shown that renewable energy has become more dependable, sector experts say, accounting for well over half of output in some European countries, while grid operators proved they could successfully manage larger doses of fluctuating energy flows.
""This has been a real test of how resilient the grids are, and we know they coped because the lights stayed on,"" said Rory McCarthy, energy storage senior analyst at global consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie. 
""Maybe this will give confidence to governments and policy makers who were apprehensive, that they can be more ambitious about the number of renewables on the grid.""
However, before governments take decisions based on recent experiences, they will have to answer various questions, says Michelle Manook, chief executive of the World Coal Association, a lobby group for the industry. 
These include how the system would have coped in the mid of winter, when sunshine is at a premium, or how it will manage when the economy picks up and demand gathers pace.
""What seems little known or understood is that a carbon-free electricity generation system based wholly on renewables … is not currently attainable,"" Manook told Reuters.
The recent boost for wind and solar power came for all the wrong reasons: the health crisis has tipped the world into recession, pushing down electricity usage by more than a fifth in some countries, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA). 
Most grid operators automatically turned to the cheapest energy supplies to meet the falling demand. Wind and solar power costs very little to generate once the installations are built and is often backed by government mandates and subsidies. As a result, more expensive fossil fuel sources were the first to be pulled.
EUROPEAN RECORDS
Data from Finnish energy technology group Wartsila, collated from Europe’s electricity grid operators, shows renewables generated an average of 44% of power across the 27-nation bloc and Britain from April to June, when many countries were in lockdown, against 37.2% in the same period last year. Daily peaks hit 53%.
The leading performer was Austria which saw renewables average 93% from a previous 91%, thanks largely to hydropower, the data showed. Portugal saw its share of renewable energy surge to 67% from 49%, while in Europe’s biggest economy Germany it averaged 54% up from 47.5%.
(GRAPHIC - EU renewable electricity generation as a % of the total April-June 2020: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/qmyvmkmzqvr/Pasted%20image%201595331862258.png)
""We are seeing figures we weren’t expecting to see for another 10 years,"" said Matti Rautkivi, Wartsila’s director of strategy and business development.
The increase in the share of renewables is essential if the European Union wants to achieve its climate and energy goals and cut harmful greenhouse gas emissions blamed for climate change.
The EU's target is to meet 32% of its energy needs, including transport, from renewable sources by 2030, but will review these goals later this year.
“It is encouraging that the penetration of renewables has increased,” EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson told Reuters.
“We are currently assessing the impact of the more ambitious 2030 climate objectives and different scenarios of getting there, including the role of renewables,” she said.
Britain’s  National Grid  (L:NG) has set itself a target of being able to operate a completely carbon-free electricity system by 2025, which it says would be the world’s first. The coronavirus lockdown provided an early test, with renewables hitting a peak share of 67.5% of electricity in May. The country also went without coal power for 67 days from April 10 to June 16 – the longest such stretch since 1882. 
While clean power is increasingly available, storing it and ensuring a smooth supply remains highly complicated. Winds die down, clouds cover the sun, or, alternatively, gales can blow on bright, sunny days.
The grid managed fluctuations by relying, in part, on a tool called “demand side response” (DSR), said Julian Leslie, head of networks at National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO).
DSR asks users to time their consumption to match power generation – something that can ease pressure on the grid and reduce costs for consumers. 
Dan Tonkin, who runs operations at the Cornish Ice Company, a firm that supplies ice for the fishing industry in southwest Britain, has been one of the beneficiaries of this system. He says he received emails from network managers as part of a trial telling him the best times to utilize his energy-intensive machinery - when supplies were ample and prices cheap. 
“For example, they’ll say that the following day they want me to run at 100%, which means I can operate virtually free,” he said. 
STORING SUNLIGHT
A similar system is in place in India, where officials in 2017 started asking farmers in some regions to water fields in the daytime to make use of higher solar and wind output, a power ministry official in New Delhi said. 
They had previously been expected to irrigate late at night or in the evening to preserve power supplies during the day for other industries.
As elsewhere in the world, the share of renewable energy in India’s electricity market climbed during the COVID-19 lockdown, hitting a record high of 30.9% in the week of June 15 from 17.9% in mid-March, the IEA said.
While Britain’s DSR system of matching power generation with consumption provides some relief to grids, it is not a panacea.
The country's National Grid has regularly had to fall back on so-called “curtailments”, paying power producers to shut down when electricity supply is too high and risks disturbing operations. 
The firm said it expected to pay out 826 million pounds ($1 billion) in various costs from May to August, more than double than in the same period last year. It did not give a breakdown, but said curtailments made up a ""significant proportion"" of this.
Jorge Pikunic, managing director of business solutions at British utility  Centrica  Plc (L:CNA), said those costs were a problem. ""The solution to balancing the system of the future does not lie in curtailing,"" he said. ""Instead, we should … encourage the use of flexible technologies such as DSR and storage.""
The United States is a world leader when it comes to storage, notably battery technology, and some businesses are investing heavily in the sector.
Renewables, including hydro, wind and solar, provided 23% of U.S. electricity during the April lockdown, up from 17% in the same period of 2019, latest U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data shows. The peak share rose to almost 80% in parts of the windy interior of the country.

President Donald Trump’s administration has warned that too large an increase in the use of renewables on the grid will reduce its resilience against weather-related disruptions. It says coal plants serve a crucial role in reliability because they can store large amounts of fuel on site. 
Looking to at least partially address this problem, California, which has the most installed solar capacity of any U.S. state, hopes to more than quadruple its battery capacity by year end, to just over 900 megawatts.
Anne Gonzales, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which maintains the state’s grid, says battery facilities are normally placed next to solar plants and can be used to extend output from the sites beyond sundown.
Keen to encourage the development of battery technology, the British government said on July 14 it was cutting red tape and relaxing planning rules to make it easier to launch large-scale energy storage projects. 
Ben Backwell, CEO of the Global Wind Energy Council, a Brussels-based trade association, said governments will have to introduce an array of such initiatives if they want to build on recent experiences and further boost renewable energy.

""Depending on how quickly demand revives we would expect incumbent fossil fuels to come back into the market and for the share of renewables to return to levels closer to those before COVID, unless there are policy changes,"" he said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Parliament will not rubber stamp a European Union leaders' accord on a massive coronavirus stimulus, the assembly's head said on Wednesday, pledging to reverse research cuts and tie disbursements to democratic values.
While welcoming the 750 billion euro ($865 billion) recovery fund agreed by leaders after five days of negotiations, parliament president David Sassoli said the assembly wanted to reshape the related 1.1 trillion euro ($1.27 trillion) EU budget.
""There is a proposal on the table, but we would like to improve that, above all by trying to give answers to some of the cuts that we've deemed unjustified,"" he told a news conference a day after EU leaders clinched a deal.
Judged an historic breakthrough by French President Emmanuel Macron because the bloc will raise common debt on a large scale for the first time, the summit deal came at the price of reductions to climate-friendly funds, research and money for the Erasmus student exchange programme.
""NOT SATISFIED""
Under EU rules, the parliament must approve the package that would likely reach economies from early- to mid-2021, but it was not immediately clear how the assembly could reopen the accord without risking its collapse. 
Governments reeling from the worst recession in Europe since World War Two do not want to see delays, arguing that a failure to make disbursements soon would undermine the fund's impact.
But Sassoli was adamant when it came to the 2021-2017 common EU budget: ""We cannot cut the budget for research and young people and Erasmus, we can't.""
Leaders also delayed a promised new mechanism to limit recovery funds to countries failing to uphold media freedoms and human rights, such as Hungary and Poland, which Sassoli said was unacceptable. 
""We will not be satisfied with just mentions of principle,"" Sassoli said, referring to the summit's final communique.
Sassoli said a final parliament vote on both packages would be in a couple of months.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer aims to clear the way for an almost blanket motorway toll for cars across Germany and Europe during the country's presidency of the European Union, a draft document seen by Reuters on Wednesday showed.
Within eight years, almost all vehicles on motorways, including lorries, vans and cars, would have to pay tolls, according to the draft for the EU toll directive.
""As regards member states that have already established a charging system, tolls or user charges shall be levied upon all vehicles except coaches and buses,"" stated the document which Scheuer wants German ministries to approve on Wednesday.
That would make it Germany's official proposal for its presidency of the bloc which started on July 1 and runs until the end of the year.
However, some government officials told Reuters that some German ministries wanted to put the project on ice even though a distance-based toll is widely seen as a measure to help protect the climate. 

It is particularly sensitive for ministries headed by the Social Democrats (SPD), who share power with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and have long been critical of car tolls.

Investing.com -- Tesla publishes hotly-awaited results for the second quarter, with its legions of fan-investors betting heavily that another quarterly profit will lead to its inclusion in the S&P 500. Talks over the next stimulus package in Congress are struggling due to differences of opinion between the administration and Senate Republicans, as well as between Republicans and Democrats. Gold looks set to test its all-time high from nine years ago, while silver is also breaking out. Stocks are set to open mixed and weekly U.S. inventories data are weighing on oil prices. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, July 22nd.
1. Showtime for Tesla 
The moment of truth for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is about to arrive. Or rather, the company will publish its second-quarter results after the closing bell, at a time when its valuation is, more than ever, anchored in faith rather than rational economic analysis.
Analysts expect the company to have lost 19 cents a share on revenue of $5 billion in the quarter, but bulls have been sustained by surprisingly strong delivery numbers and by the leak of internal memos from CEO Musk suggesting that the company may break even.
Another quarterly profit would be a necessary – but not sufficient – condition for inclusion in the S&P 500, forcing a multitude of passively-managed funds to hold the stock. Speculation on S&P 500 inclusion has been a major factor behind the stock’s 60% rally since late June.
2. Stimulus negotiations making slow progress
Negotiations on the latest U.S. stimulus package are set to continue, with only nine days left before many of the current support mechanisms expire.
Senate Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that he would propose a new round of direct payments to those below a certain earnings threshold, similar to the $1,200 checks issued earlier in the year. However, the $1 trillion price tag mooted by Republicans is far from the $3 trillion package being prepared by House Democrats.
In addition to sparring with the Dems, it isn’t clear whether Senate Republicans are in agreement with President Trump’s desire to see a payroll tax cut included in the bill.
3. Stocks set to open mixed. Microsoft, CSX, Chipotle earnings due later
U.S. stock markets are set to open mixed, with the Dow and S&P 500 down but the Nasdaq stabilizing after Tuesday’s retracement from its latest all-time high.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 120 points or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 futures futures contract was down 0.4% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was essentially flat.
Among the early reporters, Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) and Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP) both exceeded expectations for earnings in the three months through June. However, the big releases of the day come after the close, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) all joining Tesla in reporting.
4. Gold, Silver rally continues
Gold and silver futures continued to surge after breaking out to historic highs on expectations that low or negative real interest rates will be a fact of life for years to come. By 6:30, gold futures were up 0.8% at $1,857.80 a troy ounce, while silver futures were up 3.9% at $22.40.
Gold's rally comes at a time when the Senate is poised to approve the appointment of Judy Shelton to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. Shelton has advocated in the past for a return to the gold standard, a policy that would have powerfully deflationary consequences if reintroduced today. 
Gold now looks set to test the $1,900/oz level for the first time since September 2011, while silver is at its highest since 2013.
5. Oil dips after API stock build
Crude oil prices have retraced from four-month highs after the American Petroleum Institute reported a 7.54 million-barrel rise in crude stocks last week, almost entirely reversing the previous week’s withdrawal.
The numbers raise fresh doubts about whether U.S. fuel demand can recover sustainably as long as the south and west of the country continue to report rising numbers of deaths and new infections from the coronavirus.
U.S. Crude futures were down 1.1% at $41.45 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent was down 1.0% at $43.88 a barrel.
The government’s inventory data for last week are due at 10:30 AM ET."
44,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>","Japan raises economic view for second month, but wary over virus resurgence","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government slightly raised its economic view for a second straight month in July, though authorities conceded that the situation remained severe in light of a renewed spike in coronavirus cases in many parts of the world.
The government described the world's third-largest economy as ""showing signs of picking up"" from the recession induced by COVID-19, underscoring cautious optimism among policymakers as more countries started re-opening economies from lockdowns to rein in the virus.
Although the global economy has shown some recent signs of bottoming out, analysts say demand for cars and other durable goods is unlikely to recover strongly, given the resurgence of infections in major economies.
""The Japanese economy remains in a severe situation due to the novel coronavirus, but it is showing signs of picking up recently,"" the government said in its economic report for July.
""The pick-up trend in the economy is expected to continue,"" it added. ""However, attention should be paid to the risk that domestic and overseas infections would affect economies.""
Japan is in the grip of its worst postwar recession as the health crisis takes a heavy toll of business and consumer activity. The economy is forecast to shrink 5.3% this fiscal year, the biggest contraction in decades, followed by a 3.3% bounce next year, a Reuters poll showed.
With car exports to China, the United States and the European Union bottoming out, and with auto production starting to pick up from June, the government raised its view on exports and output.
Shipments were about to stop contracting, and output showed signs of picking up in some industries, although declining as a whole, it said.
However, a cabinet office official said an exports recovery was unlikely to be very strong.
The government raised its view on private consumption, which accounts for more than half the economy, saying it was ""picking up"", citing the effect of its 100,000-yen ($934.67) cash payouts per citizen and demand for household appliances and eating out.
But it also warned a renewed rise in virus cases could weigh on consumer sentiment. 

The government also lifted its view on business sentiment for a second straight month in July, saying corporate morale showed a trend towards improvement, a slightly better assessment than the previous month.

The EBRD said the hit from the pandemic had been ""severe"" to the 38 economies it invests in, ranging from Estonia to Egypt and Morocco to Mongolia, predicting an average contraction of 3.5% this year.
Investments rose by more than a third compared to the first half of 2019, while nearly 2 billion euros went toward financing trade transactions in the first six month of the year, the bank added.
Turkey received nearly one billion euros or a fifth of total investments over the first half of 2020, while Egypt was the second-biggest beneficiary at 459 million euros, results showed.
Dealing with the fallout of pandemic also meant a potential expansion of the bank's operations into Sub-Saharan Africa had been put on ice. The plan had been expected to be put to shareholders this year.
""We live in a new world now and for us the focus is on the challenges of our existing clients and in our existing countries,"" said Jurgen Rigterink, the EBRD's acting president.
""Having said that, the need for the EBRD business model is still there,"" he said, adding he expected to get shareholder approval to expand to Sub-Saharan Africa in 2022.
While the EBRD only released its operational, not its financial results, Ritgerink warned that the bank would post a ""considerable loss"" in the first half of the year, though this was driven by a hit to its equity portfolio on both valuations and currency depreciation.

Majority owned by G7 top economic powers, the EBRD reiterated it expected to invest around 21 billion euro through to the end of 2021.

Laura Wallis will become the first woman in charge of the governor’s office when she takes up the role on Aug. 3. She joined the BOE as part of the Prudential Regulation Authority in 2013, after a decade at the Financial Services Authority.
The role of private secretary, who’s in charge of overseeing the implementation of the governor’s policies with other officials, is seen as a stepping stone to the highest ranks at the central bank. The remit offers insights into every corner of the 326-year-old institution.
At the PRA, Wallis’s roles included supervision of international banks and overseeing the BOE’s work relating to the U.K.’s exit from the European Union. Most recently she was Head of Financial Market Infrastructure Regulation.
She also served as co-chair of the BOE’s women’s network until 2018. The bank started recruiting female employees as far back as the 1890s, but recently it’s struggled to meet targets for their advancement to senior management roles.
The BOE confirmed Wallis’ appointment to the position, which is the equivalent management grade to director.
Previous holders include Executive Director for Financial Stability Alex Brazier -- who described the job as the governor’s “eyes and ears” -- and Bailey himself, who served in the role under Eddie George.
Other former holders of the post who went on to more senior roles include Spencer Dale, chief economist under Mervyn King, and Paul Tucker, who was considered among the front runners to head the BOE when King left.

Singapore had welcomed a record 19.1 million travellers in 2019 - more than three times its total population.
But the island city-state closed its borders earlier this year and has advised its citizens to avoid going overseas - a position that is unlikely to change in the near term.
Tourism numbers for the remainder of the year would be similar to April and May when they fell 99.9%, said Singapore Tourism Board chief executive Keith Tan. The board unveiled a S$45 million ($32.5 million) marketing and promotion campaign to drive local demand for lifestyle and tourism businesses.
Singapore is hoping locals, who spent S$34 billion on overseas travel in 2018, will splash out on staycations at hotels and visit tourist attractions.
Still, the STB does not expect residents, already worried about salaries and jobs, to be able to fill the S$27.1 billion hole left by international visitors.
""Given the severe impact that COVID-19 has had on international travel, it is inevitable that more job losses will happen in the coming months,"" Tan added.
The government has pumped in stimulus of nearly S$100 billion to cushion the impact of Singapore's worst recession.
""It is not sustainable for us to keep supporting a business model that may not longer be available or at least will not come back within the next one, two years,"" said Chan Chun Sing, minister of trade and industry, urging tourism businesses to seek new markets and niche offerings.

While demand for mass market tourism is unlikely to pick up in the near term, Chan said, Singapore has agreed to resume essential business travel with China and Malaysia. It is in talks with South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and some European nations for similar agreements.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Qantas Airways Ltd's (AX:QAN) last Boeing 747 jet drew a kangaroo tail in the sky off the Australian coast as it began its final flight to retirement in the Mojave Desert on Wednesday, ending the model's almost half a century of service at the carrier. 
Owen Zupp, one of the six pilots on board the final flight, brought forward by several months because of the coronavirus pandemic, said he would reflect once his team had delivered the plane safely to the United States.
""Once that is done I think it will be a memory that we can look back on with great pride,"" Zupp told Reuters. ""It is significant not just for Qantas' history but aviation.""
Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce, who signed the plane before it took off from Sydney Airport, said the model had helped make international travel more affordable for Australians.
""It overcame the tyranny of distance that was and continued to be an issue for Australia,"" he told a gathering in a hangar for the send-off. 
Ironically, the reason for the plane's early departure was also the reason for the small crowd of 150. Thousands had been expected to attend a farewell initially planned for the end of the year.
Qantas 747s carried more than 250 million people in almost half a century of service, including Queen Elizabeth II and every Australian Olympic team since 1984. Qantas was once the world's only airline with an all 747 fleet. 
The four-engine plane with less favourable economics than newer-generation 787s and Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A350s had fallen out of favour even before the coronavirus pandemic but Qantas, British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and KLM have hastened retirement plans due to the lack of international travel demand.
Qantas has grounded most international flights until at least July 2021 due to Australian government travel restrictions.
Boeing (N:BA), which has in recent years been manufacturing the latest version of the 747 primarily as a freighter, and its suppliers signalled the end of the plane when they set the final number of parts it would need for the programme at least a year ago.
There are only 30 747 passenger jets left in service globally and 132 in storage, according to aviation data provider Cirium, with freighters accounting for 93% of the type still flying. 
Joyce said Qantas had sold five of its 747s to  General Electric  Co (N:GE). The final jet will deliver a load of freight to Los Angeles before flying on to the Mojave. 

Vincent Chu, 29, was among a crowd gathered near the airport to watch the plane leave: ""I just wanted to give it a final send-off, so to speak.""

54,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 03:30AM ET</span>","China central bank to pause easing as economy recovers, wary of over-stimulus: sources","By Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's central bank does not see an immediate need to ease monetary policy further, but will keep conditions accommodative to support a recovery in the world's second-largest economy, four policy sources told Reuters.
A stronger-than-expected rebound in activity in the second quarter has reduced the urgency for the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to act, after policymakers announced unprecedented emergency measures early in the year to deal with the shock from the coronavirus crisis.
The PBOC also wants to avoid the side-effects caused by excessive stimulus, such as a surge in debt and risks of bubbles in the property market, said the sources, who are involved in internal policy discussions.
Moreover, policymakers are keen to save their ammunition amid uncertainty over how long it will take the global economy to recover and rising Sino-U.S. tensions, the sources said.
""We should keep monetary policy stable in the near term and leave some space for the future,"" one of the sources said.
The PBOC did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
The PBOC has rolled out a raft of steps since February, including cuts in lending rates, banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR) and targeted support for virus-hit companies such as cheap loans. 
That marked an escalation in the current easing cycle that started in early 2018, although it has not slashed interest rates to near zero or embarked on quantitative easing as have many other major central banks.
The economy grew 3.2% in the second quarter, following a record 6.8% slump in the first three months of 2020 as the virus and strict measures to contain it paralyzed much of the country.
That was backed by record first-half bank lending of 12.09 trillion yuan ($1.73 trillion).
PBOC Governor Yi Gang has pledged to keep liquidity ample and boost new loans to nearly 20 trillion yuan this year, but he has also said China would need to consider withdrawing policy support at some point.
LIMITED ROOM 
While the PBOC is likely to slow the pace of easing, the sources said further cuts in banks' reserve ratios and interest rates may still be needed to support accelerating government bond issuance - part of fiscal stimulus to spur growth -- or if the economy falters again.
While many factories appear to be back to nearly full speed, consumers are cautious about spending, and many smaller, private companies continue to struggle. 
""There is still room for cutting RRR and interest rates, especially RRR,"" said a second source.
On Monday, China kept its benchmark lending rate steady at 3.85% for the third straight month, after it was cut by a total of 46 basis points since last August.
The PBOC has also cut the average reserve ratio, or the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves, by 520 basis points since early 2008, to 9.4%.
""Whether we need to roll out more easing steps will depend on the economic performance. The recovery trend is clear,"" said a second source.
""The frequency of monetary policy easing will decline in the second half, but that does not mean we will tighten policy."" 
In May, Beijing scrapped its annual growth target due to huge uncertainties caused by the pandemic. Analysts have long said high targets encouraged excessive spending and wasteful investment.
Guo Kai, vice head of the PBOC's monetary policy department, said this month that loans would not be used effectively if credit supply is too fast, and speculative activity could grow if interest rates are too low.
Policymakers are tolerating some rises in debt levels as they focus on spurring growth, but they are carefully watching for any resurgent property speculation as home prices have soared well beyond the reach of ordinary people, insiders said.
Average home prices in China rose 0.6% in June, the fastest pace in a year, while Chinese stock markets have rallied strongly in July.[.SS]

""Debt should not be a big concern - every country has seen rises in debt - we should worry about the property sector, there are definitely worries about money flowing into property,"" said a source.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The re-introduction of measures to halt the spread of the coronavirus in Australia's second largest state will shave 0.75 percentage points off the country's economic output in the third quarter, a government source familiar with official estimates said on Wednesday.
Victoria state earlier this month told nearly 5 million people they would need to stay home for six weeks, permitted to leave only for essential business, as authorities struggle to contain a flare-up of coronavirus cases.
The shutdown has dashed any hope that Australia's A$2 trillion ($1.4 trillion) economy will rebound quickly. It is facing its deepest economic shock since the Great Depression with the unemployment rate at a 22- year high.
Facing a prolonged economic downturn, Australia said on Tuesday said it would spend A$16.8 billion to extend its wage subsidies for businesses hit by the coronavirus pandemic. 
The six-month extension of the programme allays fears of a hard end to the current A$70 billion scheme, but most economists expect a significant economic contraction.

Westpac earlier this month downgraded its forecasts for growth to a 4.2% contraction in 2020 from a 4% fall previously.

Southeast Asia's largest economy attracted 97.6 trillion rupiah ($6.7 billion) of FDI in April-June, excluding investment in banking and oil and gas, a 6.9% drop in rupiah terms from a year ago and a roughly 3% fall in dollar terms, investment board (BKPM) data showed.
That followed a 9.2% fall in FDI in the first quarter as investors postponed investment decisions due to the pandemic.
Top sources of FDI in the second quarter were Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Japan.
BKPM chief Bahlil Lahadalia noted FDI from Singapore had held up despite the city-state posting a 41% quarterly drop in its GDP in the second quarter, which he said showed it was a merely a hub for investment from elsewhere.
""We must begin to rethink whether the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Economic Community has benefitted Indonesia,"" said Lahadalia, adding this was a rational debate and noting Britain's decision to leave the European Union. 
The ASEAN Economic Community was established in 2015 to integrate the economies of its 10 member states. The group has had a number of free trade agreements as an economic block and is pursuing further integration in the broader economic sector as well as in political security and socio-cultural matters.
Referring to the coronavirus pandemic's impact, Lahadalia said he was optimistic FDI would improve in the second half of 2020 and was praying for the outbreak not to worsen.
In the second quarter, industries that received the most FDI included power, gas and water, base metals and transportation, warehousing and telecommunications.

Indonesia's coronavirus case count as of Tuesday was 89,869 with 4,320 deaths and President Joko Widodo has said the outbreak was not expected to peak until August or September.

YANGSHUO, China (Reuters) - The dam at a small reservoir in China's Guangxi region gave way last month after days of heavy rain in a collapse that could be a harbinger of sterner tests for many of the country's 94,000 aging dams as the weather gets more extreme.
Located in Yangshuo county, famed for its otherworldly karst landscape, the dam collapsed at around midday on June 7, inundating roads, orchards and fields in Shazixi village, residents told Reuters.
""I've never seen such flooding,"" said villager Luo Qiyuan, 81, who helped build the dam decades ago. 
""The water levels were never so high in previous years, and the dam had never collapsed."" 
Completed in 1965, the dam, made of compacted earth, was designed to hold 195,000 cubic metres of water, enough to fill 78 Olympic-size swimming pools and meet the irrigation needs of Shazixi's farmers. 
On a visit to the reservoir in mid-July, Reuters found the length of the dam, of about 100 metres, had largely vanished. It was reinforced 25 years ago.
The water went over the dam, which then collapsed, said a member of a survey crew at the reservoir, declining to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media. 
Shazixi residents said there were no deaths.
But the collapse, which was not reported by domestic media, suggests big storms might be enough to overwhelm reservoirs, especially if the design is inferior and maintenance has been patchy. 
That raises the prospect of disaster in river valleys and flood plains that are much more densely populated than they were when the dams were built.
Environmental groups say climate change is bringing heavier and more frequent rain. Massive flooding could trigger unforeseen ""black swan"" events, the government says, with extreme consequences.
EXTREME EVENTS
Thousands of dams were built in the 1950s and 1960s in a rush led by Mao Zedong to fend off drought in a largely agrarian China.
In 2006, the Ministry of Water Resources said, between 1954 and 2005, dykes had collapsed at 3,486 reservoirs due to sub-standard quality and poor management. 
It was unclear if record-breaking rains were to blame for the Shazixi collapse or if the dam's emergency spillway had been blocked by silt or if it was a design problem.
The water resources department in the area declined to comment. The county government did not respond to a request for comment. 
In Guangxi, in southwestern China, rainfall and temperatures were on average significantly higher in 1990-2018 compared with the previous 29 years, official data shows. 
It's the extreme events that put dams at risk, said David Shankman, a geographer at the University of Alabama who studies Chinese floods.
""But a dam should be able to withstand extreme events even if they become regular, and when the flood is over, it should be exactly of the same quality as before the event, if the dam was properly designed and built,"" Shankman said.
According to a notice at the Shazixi reservoir's monitoring station, the 151.2 metre-tall dam was built with a once-every-two-century worst-case scenario in mind in which water was expected to reach 149.48 metres. Last month, it overflowed.
In the county seat of Yangshuo in June, more rain fell in three hours than usually falls in two months. 
The Ministry of Water Resources did not respond to a request for comment. 
In what could be another sign of trouble to come, water behind a dam on a tributary of the Yangtze river rose so sharply that authorities on Sunday were forced to blow up part of the dam to lower the level.
'BLACK SWAN'
In China's worst dam catastrophe, the Banqiao on the Yellow River, completed in 1952 with Soviet assistance, collapsed in 1975, killing tens of thousands of people, official estimates published two decades later showed.
Ye Jianchun, deputy minister of the Ministry of Water Resources, told a recent news conference he was confident flood-control projects on major rivers were capable of handling the largest floods seen since the founding of the People's Republic of China.
But Ye was not so categorical about dams on other rivers, saying excessive floods may exceed the defence capability of the engineering to result in a ""black swan"" event.
Aware of the risks, authorities have been reinforcing and raising old dams and stepping up inspections. New dams are planned to increase storage capacity. 
North of Yangshuo at Qingshitan is the biggest dam in the area. The banks of the river into which it empties have been shored up since last month, said a workman dumping rocks and soil with a wheel loader. 
But climate change is bringing a new normal of extremes and flood-risk policies decided a decade or two ago are no longer sufficient, said Benjamin Horton, director at the Earth Observatory of Singapore.

""What really needs to happen is to work with the ecosystems, not against them by building dams, by extending flood wetlands and flood plains and allowing the water to naturally mix with the environment,"" he said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea on Wednesday scaled back plans to impose capital gains taxes on stock investments in response to complaints by retail investors, but said it will hike taxes for top earners as part of changes in its annual tax code revision.
It comes after retail investors took to social media and called the tax yet another policy that ""kicks away ladder"" for upward social mobility, after skyrocketing property prices have priced many out of home ownership in recent years.
The finance ministry also proposed to hike income tax on earnings exceeding 1 billion won ($838,040) a year to 45% from 42% currently, which will help offset the expected loss in revenue from changes in the capital gains tax.
Taxes of up to 25% will be imposed from 2023 on annual capital gains exceeding 50 million won ($41,650) a year for retail investors who trade listed shares. The tax was previously due to kick in on capital gains exceeding 20 million won.
Policy tweaks aim to ""better support retail investors and help them build up financial wealth amid (a) low interest rate environment,"" the ministry said in a statement.
The finance ministry also said stock transaction taxes will be cut in phases to 0.15% by 2023 for KOSPI-listed shares from 0.25% currently.
South Korea's retail investors poured over 30 trillion won into local shares in the first six months of the year, the largest on record for comparable periods.
The benchmark KOSPI (KS11) has gained more than 50% from the year's lows as investors seek to buy into a cheapened market, backed by ample liquidity amid record low interest rates.
The revised capital gains tax proposal on stock investment will affect 150,000 investors, or the top 2.5% of all stock investors, the ministry said. 
Separately, the government will start taxing capital gains from cryptocurrencies. Starting October 2021, any annual gains of more than 2.5 million won from trading of cryptocurrencies will be subject to a 20% capital gains tax, for local tax-paying residents. 

The tax code revisions are subject to parliamentary approval, once it is submitted to the National Assembly by September 3, it said.

63,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 09:20PM ET</span>","Britain's economy racing as lockdown lifts, but outlook has not improved: Reuters poll","By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will expand at its quickest pace in decades this quarter after shrinking at its fastest pace in centuries last quarter, a Reuters poll found, as vast swathes of the economy have reopened following a nationwide shutdown to control the coronavirus. 
Despite near-term optimism, almost 85% of respondents, 32 of 38, thought the outlook for the British economy had stayed the same or worsened over the past month, with only six saying it had improved. 
The virus has infected almost 15 million people across the world and Britain has the highest death toll in Europe - despite the government forcing businesses to close and citizens to stay home.
(Reuters Poll: UK economic and monetary policy outlook - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/qzjvqwkqavx/UK%20economic%20outlook.PNG)
But many restrictions have now been eased and people are emerging from their homes, returning to work and spending money again, so the economy was expected to expand 12.2% this quarter, the July 13-21 Reuters poll showed, better than the 10.5% recovery predicted last month.
That bounceback comes after an historic 18.9% contraction pencilled in for last quarter and nearly all economists who responded to an extra question said the biggest threat to the recovery would be a second wave of virus infections.
""The economy will almost certainly have imploded over Q2 as a whole. The good news is that in terms of the monthly trajectory, there is clear evidence that the economy has remained on an upward path since May,"" said Philip Shaw at Investec.
""But the challenge of course is keeping the economy from running out of steam.""
This year, the economy was expected to contract 9.1%, the median in the poll of over 70 economists showed, and then recover to expand 6.0% in 2021. In a worst case scenario it will shrink 13.0% this year.
Official GDP figures said the economy grew a slower than expected 1.8% in May. 
To tackle the hit from COVID-19 to the economy the British government has massively ramped up spending, borrowing 128 billion pounds ($163 billion) last quarter, five times the amount during the same period last year.
But only a slim majority said the Treasury's response had been enough - 14 of 25 respondents to an additional question said. 
""The authorities have done broadly what they needed to do,"" said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
(Reuters Poll: UK economic recovery outlook - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/yxmvjrogevr/Britain%20economy.PNG)
Forming the centrepiece of the government's support was a scheme to pay 80% of wage bills if staff were put on leave rather than let go. But that is due to close in October and unemployment was seen peaking at 8.0% in the fourth quarter.
The Bank of England chopped borrowing costs to a record low of 0.10% and restarted asset purchases. But no change in policy was expected at its next meeting on Aug. 6.
The bank rate will not rise until 2022, but an additional 70 billion pounds ($89 billion) will be added to the BoE's existing 745 billion pounds quantitative easing programme toward the end of this year, the poll showed.
Another risk is the expiry of Britain's transition period with the European Union at the end of the year, after leaving more than 40 years of membership in March. 
The two sides resumed talks on Tuesday but while there has been little movement what divides them. Still, the aim of reaching agreement on future ties by October is ambitious but achievable, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Tuesday.
As has been consistent in Reuters polls since the June 2016 vote to leave the EU, economists almost unanimously expect the eventual relationship will be a free trade deal. 
""Failure to sign a trade agreement with the EU in 2020 will go down as a major policy error. It is inconceivable to me that the British government would be prepared to take such a risk with the economy, particularly in the current climate,"" Commerzbank's Dixon said. 

""But then Brexit and a rational approach to economic policy have never been natural bedfellows.""

BUENOS AIRES/LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Argentina and its creditors are likely to find a way to seal a $65 billion debt restructuring deal, analysts said, despite a standoff after bondholders joined forces to reject a government proposal and put forward one of their own.
Three major creditor groups on Monday unveiled a joint counteroffer, the first time the trio had unified, lowering their demands but hardening opposition to a ""final"" offer the government made in early July.
The new proposal closed the gap between two sides' proposals to within around 3 cents on the dollar in terms of valuation, which most said should be bridged in last-ditch talks. The two sides are currently working toward an Aug. 4 deal deadline.
""We expect that negotiations in coming weeks should ultimately lead to an agreement, given the authorities' appetite to avoid a chaotic default that would put the economy in further pain,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
The investment bank calculated the creditors' new proposal was valued at around 55.8 points at a 10% exit yield, versus 52.4 points for the government's offer, and that the two sides were ""inching closer"" to an deal even if more talks were needed.
Argentine over-the-counter bonds rose 0.6% on average on Tuesday after having edged down on Monday.
'WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD'
Argentina's President Alberto Fernandez and Economy Minister Martin Guzman, who has led the negotiations, have maintained that the government offer was the maximum effort the recession-hit country could make after slipping into default in May.
""I trust that the creditors understand that we are making a huge effort with the offer we made and that it is the most we can do,"" Fernandez said during a video conference on Tuesday hosted by the Americas Society/Council of the Americas.
He added it was impossible to do more with poverty levels at 40%, adding his government had inherited a country already in a ""very complex situation"" of recession and unsustainable debt.
""When we came into government in December, it's like Argentina was in intensive care and with an automatic respirator. And then the pandemic came and the respirator was gone. So now we face the situation that we face,"" he said.
Citi analysts said that the government's position may soften in coming weeks and that the new counterproposal was a ""step in bringing together the two positions."" 
""The authorities have stated that the amended proposal presented in early July will not be modified, but we believe this is mostly a negotiation tactic,"" the bank added.
A creditor source with knowledge of the talks said that there was confidence both sides could move to find a middle ground between the two proposals.
""It is now really down to where the rubber meets the road. There is a tiny economic difference between the two proposals. There will have to be give on both sides,"" the person said, asking not to be named.
The person added that getting a deal done without litigation was in everyone's best interest and that an agreement could be reached in a matter of days if the government was flexible.

""If both sides are willing to move, they can make a deal quickly,"" the person said.

65,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 08:11PM ET</span>","Democrats want more money, more detail after meeting Trump team on coronavirus relief","By David Morgan and David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans and Democrats remained far apart on Tuesday on how much to spend on the next round of coronavirus relief as they discussed proposals to extend unemployment insurance for Americans thrown out of work and provide more money for schools. 
After separate meetings with White House and Treasury officials, Republican and Democratic lawmakers said they expected the eventual legislation to include more funding for coronavirus testing, despite earlier resistance to the idea from President Donald Trump's administration.
But there was debate over whether to accept Trump's demands for a payroll tax cut, which even some Senate Republicans questioned. Democrats said Republicans and the White House had not united on a proposal. The payroll tax funds federal retirement programs such as Social Security.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the $1 trillion Republicans say they are considering would not be sufficient to do what is needed for the U.S. economy and Americans' health. The Democratic-run House of Representatives passed a $3 trillion relief bill two months ago that the Republican-majority Senate has ignored.
""We want to see this (Republican) bill, not just have a conversation,"" Pelosi told reporters after a meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.
""We’re glad they came to see us, we’re glad they outlined some very broad concepts, but they’re not close to getting ready to negotiate,"" Schumer said.
Mnuchin said, however, the day's meetings were productive and he hoped for agreement by the end of next week.
""That’s an important time frame, because we want to get something done before the unemployment insurance expires"" on July 31, he said.
The United States has recorded more than 3.8 million coronavirus cases and over 141,000 deaths. Tens of millions have been thrown out of work. 
Mnuchin and Meadows spent much of the day discussing White House priorities for the legislation with lawmakers, first with Senate Republicans, then with Pelosi and Schumer.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Republicans would soon unveil a new coronavirus bill that is expected to have a $1 trillion price tag. 
He said it would include $105 billion for schools; assistance for small businesses; direct payments to individuals and families; help for businesses to meet the cost of protecting employees and customers; money for vaccines, diagnostics and treatments; and liability protection for businesses, healthcare facilities, churches, charities and government agencies. 
Democrats are proposing $175 billion to help elementary and secondary schools cope with the pandemic and have said they are determined to fight for provisions in a $3 trillion bill that passed the House in May and includes aid to state and local governments, extended unemployment insurance for displaced workers and protections for workers.
There are also disagreements within the Republican ranks over what new legislation should contain.
'TIME TICKING AWAY'
""I'm going to introduce a bill in the next few days that is a starting place, that enjoys fairly significant support among Republican senators - probably not everyone,"" McConnell told a news conference.
The White House had threatened to upstage the negotiations by pressing for the elimination of billions of dollars for testing. But in an apparent reversal, Mnuchin said the administration wanted ""to make sure there's plenty of money for testing. And that's a big priority.""
Trump has also called for a payroll tax cut, a provision Meadows described on Tuesday as ""a very high priority."" 
There is little enthusiasm for such a move on Capitol Hill.
""There are some differences of opinion on the question of the payroll tax cut and whether that's the best way to go,"" McConnell said. 
Trump, who is seeking re-election, wants the payroll tax cut ahead of the November election and sees it as a major stimulus for the pandemic-stricken U.S. economy, according to the White House. Democrats have said such a move is unnecessary and could threaten Social Security benefits.

The UK government's assumption is that there will not be a deal, though it remains possible that a ""basic"" agreement could be reached if the EU gives ground in the autumn, the newspaper said, citing government sources. 
The government expects it will trade with Europe on World Trade Organisation terms when the transition period ends, the report added.
Britain left the EU on Jan. 31 and its relationship with the bloc is now governed by a transition arrangement that keeps previous rules in place while the two sides negotiate new terms.
Negotiators remain deadlocked on fishing rights, the deal's governance, the European Court of Justice's role and so-called level playing field guarantees, the newspaper reported.
Britain is pursuing trade deals with other countries and setting up its own sanctions regime, and has previously insisted it should not have to sign up to the bloc's standards.

A spokesman for Johnson said on Monday Britain will continue to engage constructively with EU in talks on a future relationship, but that London is not willing to give up its rights as an independent state.

NEW CASTLE, Del. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden outlined a sweeping plan on Tuesday aimed at breathing life into the coronavirus-battered U.S. economy by investing $775 billion in caregiving programs for children, the elderly and the disabled.
As part of the proposal, which Biden said would create 5 million jobs, he pledged to provide all 3-year-old and 4-year-old children access to free preschool. He also promised to make it easier for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities to receive home or community-based care.
""We're trapped in a caregiving crisis within an economic crisis within a healthcare crisis,"" Biden told educators at a campaign event in New Castle, Delaware. ""You're doing everything you can, but this president is not.""
Both Biden and Republican President Donald Trump are eager to woo working women who are caring for parents and children during a pandemic that has shuttered schools and workplaces.
In budget proposals to Congress before the pandemic, Trump suggested spending $1 billion on grants to states to help them build childcare and early-learning services. The president and lawmakers are working on a fourth coronavirus relief package that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin estimated could include $1 trillion and would focus on ""kids and jobs and vaccines.""
Reuters/Ipsos polling shows Biden ahead of Trump by 11 percentage points with women, who are expected to play a critical role in swaying the most competitive swing states in the Nov. 3 election.
Eager to erase Trump's advantage with voters on the economy, Biden's latest plan is the third of a four-part approach he has rolled out in recent weeks.
The former vice president would send federal aid to state and local governments to keep childcare programs and other public services operating. 
Ultimately, the plan would seek to create 3 million jobs in the healthcare and education sectors, while bolstering the workforce overall by 5 million by allowing people who were taking care of children or relatives to rejoin the labor force.
The campaign said the initiative would be paid for by rolling back tax breaks for real estate investors and tightening enforcement of the existing U.S. tax code.
""Instead of pro-job and pro-growth policies, Biden is turning to an old friend - tax hikes and big government,"" Trump spokesman Zach Parkinson said in an email.

Biden previously released proposals aimed at boosting U.S. manufacturing and building clean-energy infrastructure projects as the country continues to reel from a pandemic that has forced millions out of jobs and has killed more than 141,000 people in the United States, the most of any country.

68,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>",Senate panel narrowly approves Trump's Fed nominee Shelton,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday approved Judy Shelton's nomination to the Federal Reserve Board in a party-line vote, delivering a win for President Donald Trump and his efforts to install a political confidante in a key economic policy-making role.
The 13-12 vote in favor of Shelton's nomination came despite a stormy confirmation hearing in mid-February, when the former Trump campaign adviser was characterized by some among the committee's Republican majority as outside the mainstream of economic thought.
Several had voiced concerns about placing the longtime Fed critic, who has questioned the need for the central bank and slammed its policies, in a position of influence over U.S. monetary policy. 
In the end, though, no Republican on the panel voted against her, while all the Democrats did. The committee endorsement sets the stage for a broader debate on Shelton's nomination before the full Senate, where a handful of moderate Republicans will hold the deciding votes on her confirmation. 
""I am confident that her deep understanding of the Fed’s monetary policy toolkit, monetary history and commitment to maintaining Fed independence will serve the Fed well in its ongoing efforts to stabilize markets, and toward its mission of price stability and full employment,"" the committee chair, Senator Mike Crapo, said ahead of the vote. 
Several of Trump's recent Fed picks had faltered during the vetting and confirmation process because of Republican skepticism they would act independently of Trump's political interests, but Crapo said he had ""no doubt"" Shelton and Waller would do so. 
It is a widely accepted convention that central bank decisions about interest rates and other policies are best made with a long-term view of the economy, as opposed to what might improve conditions during the runup to an election.
A separate nominee to the Fed's seven-member board in Washington, St. Louis Federal Reserve bank research director Christopher Waller, also advanced to a full Senate vote after winning backing by the committee by a vote of 18-7, including the support of some Democrats. Waller, who has spent his career in academia and inside the Fed, was seen as a far more conventional nominee to the central bank. 
Trump has appointed all but one of the current five governors, including Chair Jerome Powell. The president does not appoint any of the 12 regional Fed presidents. The Fed governors are all voting members of the U.S. central bank's policy-setting committee, while the regional Fed presidents, save for the New York, are voting members on a rotating basis. 

Still, critics worry that if Trump is reelected he could name Shelton to succeed Powell as chair in 2022, making the question of her political independence paramount.

MADRID (Reuters) - The European leaders' agreement on a massive stimulus plan for their coronavirus battered economies should help kick-start cross-border consolidation in Europe and complete the European banking union, Santander (MC:SAN) Chairman Ana Botin said.
""What was agreed yesterday (in the early hours of Tuesday) means the opportunity and the probability that we do get a banking union and cross-border consolidation is much higher,"" Botin told Reuters in a Zoom call.
""It will require changes, but I think those changes are much more likely today than they were yesterday,"" Ana Botin said.
Santander is the euro zone's second-biggest lender in terms of market value.
Remarks by Botin echoed comments from European Central Bank vice-president Luis de Guindos, who on Monday said that he expected banks to engage in both national and cross-border consolidation within weeks or months.
Consolidation is seen as inevitable among banks in the euro zone to gain scale, but low valuations and different legal frameworks around countries are hampering any such transactions.
Profitability across the euro zone bank sector is low and an economic recession in the region is expected to further dampen the banks' prospects, partly due to also higher loan-loss provisions related to the impact from COVID-19 outbreak.
""What has happened yesterday on the agreement in Europe is a clear stepping stone for the banking union in Europe. And banking union and free transfer of euros across countries is a pre-requisite for cross-border euro mergers and consolidation,"" Botin said.
""I do think it's the time. I do think European banks need scale,"" Botin said, adding that for now Santander was not interested in taking part.
""As of today, no, with the current rules, no. When the rules change who knows. Even then I think there are others who are more likely to be ahead of us,"" she said.
The agreement between EU leaders paved the way for the European Commission to raise billions of euros on capital markets on behalf of all 27 states, an unprecedented act of solidarity in almost seven decades of European integration.
""It is really important for Europe, I think it is a game changer, this is really a turn in the road, in the right direction,"" Botin said, adding that this ""will be seen in time as key step in the construction of Europe.""
Botin also that the agreement had diminished and averted the chances a sovereign risk and fragmentation problem in Europe and that the person, the country, who had taken the lead to make this possible was (Chancellor Angela) Merkel and Germany.
""We could have hoped for something bigger but not for something better,"" she said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - China is ready to ""fully engage"" in intensive negotiations agreed on Tuesday by the World Trade Organization to cut subsidies on fishing by year-end, sources following the talks said.
The body has been trying to reach a deal for the past 20 years on ending the subsidies which environmentalists say are contributing to a worrying decline in global fish stocks. 
The WTO's 164 members are set to start ""continuous negotiations"" in September based on a draft text with a view to getting a deal by December. One source said four week-long negotiating rounds were planned with all parties and other talks on the sidelines.
Historically, China has resisted pressure to accept restrictions and curb the size and range of its vast fleet, so the success of a deal is widely seen to rest on the willingness of China to take part in the talks and adhere to their outcome.
China, the European Union, the United States, South Korea and Japan are the top five subsidisers - with Beijing and Washington at odds over details over this issue, as well as their myriad other areas of friction.
China's ambassador Zhang Xiangchen told the closed-door meeting he supported the timetable of work towards a deal and was ""ready to fully engage in intensive negotiations"", two trade officials said.
However, Zhang also stressed the need to formulate ""meaningful and effective"" special and differential treatment (SDT) for developing countries such as China - an issue which is sensitive in Washington and could be a hurdle, they added.
""Suffice it to say that the SDT texts currently included, utterly undermine any beneficial effect of the draft prohibitions and will not garner a consensus,"" U.S. Ambassador Dennis Shea said in the same meeting.
Washington says it is unfair that major economies such as China claim developing status exemptions. 
A paper published by Marine Policy last year estimated global subsidies at $35.4 billion in 2018, although not all of those are the so-called ""harmful"" ones targeted by the WTO.
""If it were just about fish, I think countries could agree,"" said Remi Parmentier, strategic adviser for Friends of Ocean Action. ""In the background are trade tensions.""

As well as its importance for fish stocks, a deal is seen as key to validating the WTO's legitimacy as it navigates a reform crisis and seeks a new leader.

71,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 12:54PM ET</span>",Trump Order to Bar Census from Counting Undocumented Immigrants,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump plans to sign an order Tuesday barring undocumented immigrants from being counted in the 2020 census for determining U.S. House seats, a move likely to lead to a court challenge.
Trump’s plan, described by a White House official, comes as he seeks to fire up his conservative base ahead of the November election with a policy that would limit political representation for communities with growing numbers of undocumented immigrants.
Immigration rights advocates are likely to challenge the legality of Trump’s approach. The U.S. Constitution says House districts should be based on the “whole number of persons in each state,” which courts have interpreted to mean all people regardless of immigration status. The last census counted undocumented immigrants to determine representation in the House.
Trump has also said he would impose a merit-based visa system and address hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.
The Trump administration has long sought to use the census to identify the number of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. and potentially curb their political influence.
The administration last year abandoned an effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census after the U.S. Supreme Court put the plan on hold.
Democrats and immigrant-rights groups argued that the question would scare Latinos and immigrants from responding to the questionnaire. The administration said it was needed to enforce the Voting Rights Act, an explanation which did not satisfy the high court.
Opponents of the question presented documents showing that Republicans close to the administration believed it would help the GOP and expand the influence of white voters.
The census count, conducted every ten years, aims to tally the nation’s population and helps decide where federal funds for schools, hospitals, roads and bridges are spent. It is also used to decide how many seats each state has in the U.S. House.

Pompeo said he wants to build a “coalition” that understands the “threat” posed by China, after talks with U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab in London on Tuesday. At a press conference following their meeting, Raab suggested further action at Group of Seven level may follow.
The discussion came after both London and Washington stepped up their criticism of Beijing’s introduction of a new security law in Hong Kong, against the backdrop of heightened tension between rhe U.S. and China.
Last week, the U.K. banned China’s Huawei Technologies Co from its fifth generation wireless networks, citing the impact of U.S. sanctions against the company. The Trump administration has also been vocal in its attacks on China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, a theme Pompeo returned to.
“I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the British government for its principled responses to these challenges,” Pompeo told a news conference in the ornate Green Room in Lancaster House, central London.
The top U.S. diplomat praised the U.K. for banning Huawei from 5G, for condemning “China’s broken promises” on Hong Kong and for suspending the extradition treaty with its former colony.
‘Well Done’
“We support those sovereign choices. We think, well done,” Pompeo said.
Raab insisted the U.K. had not been forced into its move against Huawei by U.S pressure, despite citing American sanctions against the company as a reason for acting.
“The reality is, as a result of U.S. sanctions, we’ve of course got to look with a clear-sighted perspective about what that means, and we’ve taken a decision based on that,” he said. “But I don’t think there’s any question of strong arming.”
Both men discussed their “serious concerns” about Hong Kong, adding that the U.K. and U.S. are discussing with allies “the next steps, including at G-7 level.”
Pompeo said he wants “every nation who understands freedom and democracy” to understand “this threat that the Chinese Communist Party is posing” and to work together to counter it.
“We hope we can build out a coalition that understands the threat and will work collectively to convince the Chinese Communist Party it’s not in their best interest to engage in this kind of behavior.”

BUDAPEST/WARSAW (Reuters) - The European Union's agreement on a coronavirus recovery fund is likely to embolden nationalist leaders in Poland and Hungary because it sets no mechanism for tying the disbursement of money to democratic norms.
EU leaders agreed a watered-down wording on conditionality in Brussels on Tuesday after Warsaw and Budapest resisted tougher language that would have put more constraints on them implementing policies that other EU states deem undemocratic.
Much will now depend on how quickly and firmly the EU - and particularly Germany - moves to agree on a mechanism that would force member states to uphold democratic values as a condition for receiving funding, political analysts said.
""We fought it out!"" Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), portraying the outcome of the EU leaders' talks in Brussels as a triumph.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki hailed a victory for Warsaw, telling reporters: ""Poland cannot be deprived of a single euro."" 
Poland's ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) is now widely expected to press on with moves to tighten control of the media and courts without fears of an immediate financial backlash from Brussels. 
Despite being at odds with the European Commission over reforms that the EU executive says have eroded the independence of Poland’s judiciary, Poland will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of EU funds. 
Hungary has also increased its share of the 1.8 trillion euro ($2 trillion) deal, which includes a 750 billion euro recovery fund and a related 1.1 trillion euro 2021-2027 budget. 
Orban's governing Fidesz party will feel its hands are not immediately tied to pursue populist anti-immigration campaigns that more liberal EU states say erode the rule of law, freedom of the press and minority rights. 
The windfall should help strengthen the Polish and Hungarian economies, boosting their governments before parliamentary elections due in Hungary in 2022 and in Poland in 2023.
Orban has used a structure called the ""System of National Cooperation"" to direct public funds - including EU money - to a loyal elite that has helped him achieve his political goals. 
""(EU money) will boost (Orban's) electoral chances,"" said Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group think tank.
In Poland, President Andrzej Duda's successful re-election campaign included a pledge to direct EU public funds towards infrastructure development.
PiS, to which Duda is allied, has made clear its intention to continue pursuing socially conservative policies. Gay marriages are illegal in Poland and Duda campaigned on a pledge not to allow adoptions by gay couples or permit classes on gay rights in state schools.
EU MINDS ITS LANGUAGE 
Hungary and Poland, eastern European countries that until three decades ago were ruled by communists, had threatened to block any deal that specifically tied funding to upholding democratic norms.
With the chances of failure growing at the summit, EU leaders agreed to put off agreement on a mechanism for enforcing conditionality. 
A watered-down summit resolution said the European Council of EU leaders ""underlines the importance of the respect of the rule of law"".
Language on giving broad rights to member states to report and start proceedings against ""generalised deficiencies"" of the rule of law was replaced by a more specific and narrower ""conditionality to protect the budget.""
Piotr Buras, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank's Warsaw office, said it was now up to Germany, which holds the EU presidency for the rest of 2020, to deliver a new mechanism this year to enforce the rule of law. 
The mechanism will be agreed by qualified majority rather than by a unanimous vote among EU states, making it harder for Poland or Hungary to block it.
""(These are) very unclear (summit) conclusions, both politically and legally,"" Buras said. ""If there is a lack of this conditionality or the ... mechanism is very weak, then it will be a huge win for (Polish PiS leader Jaroslaw) Kaczynski, Morawiecki and Orban."" 
Warsaw and Budapest did not, however, achieve total victory, said Daniel Hegedus of the German Marshall Fund think tank.
The summit ""did not agree on a specific rule of law conditionality mechanism... but Morawiecki and Orban's claim that they ward off the introduction of conditionality in the new budget is not in accordance with the facts,"" he told Reuters.

Eurasia Group's Rahman said: ""At least in theory, funds can in the future now be blocked ... The odds of this happening, however, remain slight.""

Women are especially vulnerable to the negative economic effects of the pandemic because they are are more likely to work in industries that are sensitive to lockdowns and tend to be employed in the informal sector in low-income countries, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and others said in a blog published Tuesday. Females often do more unpaid housework than men, and are more at risk of dropping out of school in developing countries due to Covid-19, they said.
In the U.S., the unemployment rate for working-age women was 1.1 percentage points above the reading for men in June, compared to a typically equal rate before the pandemic and resulting recession, according to data from the Department of Labor.
“It is crucial that policy makers adopt measures to limit the scarring effects of the pandemic on women,” they said. These policies could include extending income support to the vulnerable and improved access to health care -- and over the long term, creating conditions and incentives for women to work.
The post referenced existing policies to address women’s economic situation, including a right to partially paid leave for parents with children below a certain age, a coalition to increase women’s economic participation and a grant program for informal workers. Austria, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia, France, Latin America and Togo have each instituted some of these measures.
“These policies are not only crucial to lift constraints on women’s economic empowerment, they are necessary to promote an inclusive post-Covid-19 recovery,” the fund said.

75,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 11:27AM ET</span>","GOP Plan Includes Stimulus Checks and Small-Business Loans, McConnell Says","(Bloomberg) -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Republicans will back another round of direct payments to individuals and aid for small businesses.
McConnell laid out some of the GOP’s priorities on the Senate floor Tuesday as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows were headed to the Capitol to begin talks with both parties to come up with legislation to prop up an economy sagging under a raging coronavirus pandemic.
“The American economy needs another shot of adrenaline,” McConnell said, also noting that infections are “climbing in hot spots around the country.”
The White House and Congress have only a few weeks to come up with another stimulus, even as the $2.9 trillion in economic relief passed earlier this year begins to dry up. Democrats and Republicans remain far apart on how big the package should be, and there are differences within the GOP over what to include.
Both parties say they want to get a relief bill passed by the end of the month.
President Donald Trump, who met Monday with McConnell and House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, wants a payroll tax holiday included in the plan. But that’s gotten a cool reception from Senate Republicans. The White House also has balked at including money to distribute an eventual vaccine and funding to help states with testing and tracing, both of which have support in Congress.
Mnuchin and Meadows plan to talk over the outlines of the Republican plan during the regular weekly luncheon Tuesday with GOP senators. They also are scheduled to meet with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer later in the day.
McConnell said there will be second round of the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, but “targeted” to businesses most affected by the pandemic. He also said there will be funding to reimburse businesses for the costs of “safe workplaces,” including personal protective equipment, testing, cleaning and remodeling “to protect workers and entice customers.”
Republicans also want another round of direct payments “to help American families keep driving our national comeback,” he said.
There also will be money for some child-care assistance and funding for a vaccine.
Republicans are aiming for roughly $1 trillion in stimulus, while Democrats passed a $3.5 trillion proposal in the House.

PHILADELPHIA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Backlights off, music quiet and poles bare, strip clubs across the United States closed earlier this year in the face of COVID-19 social-distancing measures that precluded the up-close nature of the exotic dancing industry. Like many businesses, these cabarets, lounges and gentlemen’s clubs hoped a $660 billion Small Business Administration (SBA) loan program would help them weather the lockdown. 
But nearly four months since the launch of the loan initiative known as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), it is still unclear whether the SBA can make it rain for them. The Trump administration has barred companies that ""present live performances of a prurient sexual nature"" from participating. Clubs sued, and two federal judges rebuked the SBA for excluding the establishments from receiving the forgivable loans meant to protect jobs amid the health crisis. 
For a government loan program that has been plagued by criticism - duplicate loans, borrowers without clear financial need, inconsistent data - the strip-club uncertainties are yet another example of confusion surrounding an initiative that pushed hundreds of billions of dollars out the door.
Will the SBA allow clubs that have not won a court order to participate? And for those that received loans, either through court order or from banks that apparently took a broad interpretation of the law, will the government forgive the loans, as it does for other borrowers?
""The ball is in the SBA’s court right now,"" said Brad Shafer, an attorney who convinced a federal judge in the U.S.  District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan to issue a ruling in May ordering the SBA to work with more than 50 strip clubs. ""We still don’t know the end of this story.""
Using loan data released by the SBA earlier this month, Reuters identified 36 organizations representing dozens of strip clubs across the country that were approved for between $11.15 million and $27.95 million worth of loans from the small business pandemic aid program. Some of the businesses received the funds after the court decision; others got the money from banks despite the ban. All totaled, these companies saved 2,548 jobs, according to the government data.
An SBA representative did not directly respond to questions about the discrepancies surrounding the loans. 
One of Shafer’s clients, John Meehan, said he does not expect a straight answer from the SBA anytime soon. 
Meehan owns three combination sports bar-strip clubs, all called Cheerleaders, in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Gloucester, New Jersey. They were hit by state and local shutdown orders for the hospitality industry. To keep employees paid while he and his partners poured up to $50,000 into cleaning and safety improvements like installing UV-light purification systems in the air ducts, he turned to the SBA for funding. 
His bank in Philadelphia denied the loan, citing SBA rules. When Meehan applied in Pittsburgh with PNC Bank for a different club, though, he was approved for a loan of between $150,000 and $350,000. 
“I wasn’t complaining, but I was scratching my head,” he said.
A spokeswoman for PNC declined to comment on specific loans, but said the bank sought to process all applications in accordance with SBA guidelines. 
“Under those guidelines, applicants were responsible for certifying that they met applicable SBA eligibility requirements, and lenders were not required to independently verify such eligibility,” she said.
RISKS FOR LENDERS 
Running afoul of the still-unclear SBA rules poses a potential hazard for lenders, who risk getting stuck with unforgiven loans on their books or litigation, lawyers said.
The SBA’s main small business funding program, known as 7(a), restricts a number of organizations, including churches and strip clubs. Under the PPP, the houses of worship received an exemption from the normal rules - the business of bare skin did not. 
“Although it’s not clear that the 7(a) program’s eligibility rules apply to PPP loans, companies that do not satisfy these rules could be sued, as could their lenders,” said Scott Pearson, a partner with Manatt, Phelps & Phillips LLP in Los Angeles.
Meehan is not the only one faced with the muddle. RCI Hospitality Holdings Inc operates more than 35 strip clubs including the self-described “largest strip club in the world,” Tootsie's Cabaret, in Miami. 
Several banks approved the company and its affiliates for between $4.45 million and $11.7 million even though RCI was not one of the companies protected by federal court rulings in Michigan and Wisconsin.
A representative of RCI declined to comment. A spokesman for lender Hancock Whitney (NASDAQ:HWC) Corp, which according to government data approved a loan to RCI Entertainment Inc in New Orleans, told Reuters the firm “followed all of the guidance that was provided by the SBA, which changed frequently as the program was being rolled out.”
Meehan’s Pennsylvania clubs remain shuttered, but his New Jersey establishment, which received a loan, has a liquor license for the outdoor patio. So while empty stools are stacked on the bar inside, outside the dancers work an improvised stage.
On a hot Friday afternoon in July, Jordan Lawrence got a few shout-outs from the audience as she fell into a split. After her big finish, she collected tips from men sipping drinks, her long blond ponytail tickling the dollar bills in her costume.
Lawrence lost her job in insurance during the pandemic and returned to her former profession as a dancer a few weeks ago. Even though she had saved up for years, she struggled to pay her bills without her old job. Lawrence said she is frustrated the SBA is squeezing her industry just as she is getting back on her feet and the stage.

“These people need to come out here and interact with people like me because they are interfering with our livelihood,” she said. “We have bills to pay too.”

78,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 09:47AM ET</span>",EU reaches historic deal on pandemic recovery after fractious summit,"By Jan Strupczewski, John Chalmers and Robin Emmott
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders clinched an historic deal on a massive stimulus plan for their coronavirus-throttled economies in the early hours of Tuesday, after a fractious summit lasting almost five days.
The agreement paves the way for the European Commission, the EU's executive, to raise billions of euros on capital markets on behalf of all 27 states, an unprecedented act of solidarity in almost seven decades of European integration. 
Summit chairman Charles Michel called the accord, reached at a 5.15 a.m. (0315 GMT), a pivotal moment for Europe.
Many had warned that a failed summit amid the coronavirus pandemic would have put the bloc's viability in serious doubt after years of economic crisis and Britain's recent departure.
World shares climbed to their highest since February and the euro briefly hit its strongest since March on news of the deal.
""This agreement sends a concrete signal that Europe is a force for action,"" a jubilant Michel told reporters. 
French President Emmanuel Macron, who spearheaded a push for the deal with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, hailed it as truly historic. 
Leaders hope the 750 billion euro ($857.33 billion) recovery fund and its related 1.1 trillion euro 2021-2027 budget will help repair the continent's deepest recession since World War Two after the coronavirus outbreak shut down economies.
Germany Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said that, with the agreement, the chances of ""a cautious, slow recovery"" in the second half of this year had increased enormously. 
While strong in symbolism, the deal came at the cost of cuts to proposed investment in climate-friendly funds and did not set conditions for disbursements to countries, such as Hungary and Poland, seen as breaching democratic values.
In an unwieldy club of 27, each with veto power, the summit also exposed faultlines across the bloc that are likely to hinder future decision-making on money as richer northern countries resisted helping out the poorer south.
The Netherlands led a group of so-called frugal states with Austria, Sweden, Denmark and Finland, insisting that aid to Italy, Spain and other Mediterranean countries that took the brunt of the pandemic should be mainly in loans, not in non-repayable grants.
""There were a few clashes, but that's all part of the game,"" said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, describing a warm relationship with his Italian counterpart, Giuseppe Conte.
But Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the frugals' negotiating power was here to stay, suggesting Europe's traditional Franco-German engine will be challenged.
ALMOST A SUMMIT RECORD
Frictions peaked on Sunday night as Macron lost his temper with the frugals, diplomats said, and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki branded them ""stingy, egotistic states"".
The bickering spun the summit out, making it the EU's second-ever longest, just 20 minutes short of a record set in 2000 in Nice, according to Rutte. ""We would have broken the record at 6:05, but we ended at 5.45,"" he said. 
Under the compromise, the Commission will borrow 750 billion euros using its triple-A debt rating, disbursing 390 billion in grants - less than the originally targeted 500 billion - and 360 billion in cheap loans.
Given the difficulties, talk of Europe's Hamilton moment - hailed as such by German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz on Monday in reference to Alexander Hamilton's decision to federalise debts of U.S. states in 1790 - is overblown.
The summit deal does not set the EU on the path towards a U.S.-style fiscal union, although some see it as a first step.
Rutte's negotiations won an emergency brake to temporarily stop transfers of money from the recovery fund if an EU state was seen as not meeting reform conditions tied to the money. 
The frugals also secured larger rebates from the next EU budget, a payback mechanism first won by Britain in the 1980s and which France had hoped to phase out after Brexit.

The recovery plan now faces a potentially difficult passage through the European Parliament and it must be ratified by all EU states. The first money will likely not reach the real economy before the middle of next year, economists say.

China's economic recovery so far and epidemic control efforts have been better than expected, China Central Television cited Xi as saying in a meeting with corporate representatives from Hikvision (SZ:002415), Goertek (SZ:002241), Panasonic China (T:6752) and others.
Xi said the government will target a good growth rate this year, making fiscal policy more proactive, prudent monetary policy more flexible, and macro-economic policies more targeted and timely, according to the report. Authorities would also continue to cut taxes, administrative fees, rent and rates to benefit businesses. 
The economy returned to growth in the second quarter after a deep slump at the start of the year, but unexpected weakness in domestic consumption underscored the need for more policy support to bolster the recovery after the shock of the coronavirus crisis.
In the face of rising protectionism, a slowing world economy and shrinking global demand, Beijing would fully take advantage of its huge domestic market.
It will also press ahead with reforms in keeping with the historical trend of economic globalisation, and companies should understand international rules and fend off risks in international markets, said Xi.

81,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>",Political capital from EU recovery deal dwarfs cash prize,"By Jan Strupczewski and John Chalmers
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The economic recovery package agreed on Tuesday after a marathon EU summit ticks most of the political boxes sketched out by the bloc's jubilant leaders - but its financial achievements appear far less substantial.
After 90 hours of quarrelling and haggling between richer northern and poorer southern states over the deal's scope, the big prize for countries worst-hit by the coronavirus pandemic was a package of 312 billion euros ($357 billion) in non-repayable grants.
But this amounts to only some 0.75% of European Union GDP a year over 2021-23, when the funds are meant to be allocated - at a time when its economies are shrinking at more than ten times that rate.
The actual value of disbursals over the next two-and-a-half years, when recovery needs will be greatest, is likely to be lower still.
Because the 27-nation club is a slow-moving machine, less than a quarter of the grants will be allocated then, the Bruegel Brussels think tank estimates.
Carsten Brzeski, euro zone economist at ING Bank, called the deal's likely economic impact ""marginal."" 
""Plus, given that the fund will only become effective on January 1, the money will probably not reach any economy before mid-2021. Pretty late,"" he said.
However, there is justification in summit chairman Charles Michel calling the accord ""a pivotal moment"" for Europe and a ""concrete signal"" of its unity.
Brzeski said underestimating its political symbolism would be a mistake, as failure could have sown ""another seed"" for the eventual break-up of the euro zone's monetary union.
CROSSING THE RUBICON
The EU has been buffeted over the past decade by debt and migration crises and, more recently, the turbulent exit of core member Britain and a lack of solidarity and coordination over its response to COVID-19.
The worry was that, with repeated disputes over policy and direction, the EU would only become more exposed to eurosceptic, nationalist and protectionist forces.
The accord, however, carries a weighty message of cooperative intent in marking the EU's greatest stride towards closer economic integration in decades. Under it, funds will for the first time be raised from markets by the executive European Commission on behalf of them all to disburse as grants, not loans.
For many, crossing that Rubicon was huge.
Daniel Gros, head of the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels said the overall recovery fund of 750 billion euros in grants and loans may look small spread over many years, but it will come close to the total fiscal stimulus measures member states are making themselves.
He said that government spending will increase national debt, sooner or later generating taxes that will have to be paid by consumers. EU debt won't have the same effect, and so it will have a stronger impact on demand than national deficit spending.
Amid the summit triumph over the hard-won deal on the recovery fund and the EU's next seven-year budget, there were also concerns that the leaders had watered down their climate change and digitalisation ambitions.
Climate advocates said the final agreement was a mixed bag, with large sums earmarked for green investments, but cuts to key climate programmes and insufficient rules to ensure cash does not support polluting investments.
The package also scaled back significantly the digital budget crafted to help the EU catch up with the United States and China in key technologies, and navigate their escalating conflict.
Money is of course needed for the immediate economic meltdown, argued Erik Nielsen, chief economist of UniCredit Bank, but so is creating an environmentally and technologically sustainable economy.
""It seems that a number of political leaders may be missing the view of the forest here as they focus ...on the branches of the trees,"" he said.

82,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>",Inflation-protected U.S. bonds have rallied but not everyone buys the story,"By David Randall and Megan Davies
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A recent rush into inflation-protected U.S. Treasury bonds has sent yields to near historic lows, but not all investors are buying into the story of higher inflation ahead. 
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and gold have lured investors, who reckon unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus will eventually produce higher prices. In June alone, investors poured a record $6 billion into TIPS according to Lipper data, while an ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA index of inflation-linked securities has rallied almost 20% this year <.MERG9QI>.
Recent polls though indicate the pandemic's legacy could actually be weak or falling prices.
""Our opinion is that the economic data is a lot muddier than people give it credit for,"" said Scott Kimball, a portfolio manager at BMO Global Asset Management, who is not bullish on TIPS. ""A deflationary environment is closer than people think."" 
Yields on 10-year TIPS (US10YTIP=RR), or real yields as they are adjusted for inflation, tumbled recently to the lowest on a closing price basis since 2012, which preceded the so-called taper tantrum, and stand currently at minus 0.849%.
That is down around 30 basis points since early-June, while nominal yields are around 5 basis points lower over the same period. Thirty-year TIPS are near record lows. 
The Fed too has contributed, buying $134 billion of TIPS between March 16 to July as part of its asset purchase program according to SocGen analysts. 
""There is a fear that the Fed expanding its balance sheet is going to create an inflationary impulse,"" said Frank Rybinski, senior investment strategist at Aegon (NYSE:AEG) Asset Management. ""I structurally don't see that right now."" 
The rally in TIPS reflects an uptick in inflation expectations, with breakeven rates now showing an expectation of 1.4% on average for the coming decade . 
""My view is it will be difficult to see breakevens moving higher. There are structural disinflationary forces which remain as vigorous as before,"" Pictet Wealth Management economist Thomas Costerg said, citing technology and globalization among the factors.
Some big-name investors including Bill Gross are also not enthusiastic about the trade, saying last week that rates had ""seen their best days."".
Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) in its mid-term outlook said it was neutral on TIPS.
""Shorter term the risks are tilted to the downside towards disinflation, even deflation ... and beyond that we see the risks flipping the other way,"" said Mike Pyle, global chief investment strategist at the BlackRock Investment Institute. 
Deepening negative real yields are also fueling some nervousness. Fixed income trading platform Tradeweb notes negative yields can be an indication that investors believe growth ""may be persistently weak and that they might as well park their money in a risk-free asset with a known real yield."" 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) noted five-year TIPS yields could soon fall below German real yields for the first time in at least half a decade. In Germany, both nominal and real yields have been negative for years, coming after massive European Central Bank stimulus.
If COVID-19 derails the economic recovery, 10-year real rates could fall all the way to minus 150 bps in the worst case scenario, BofA analysts predicted. 
Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), attributes the yields decline at least partly to investors, including hedge funds or sovereign wealth funds using them as a de facto hedge against risk. At some point, these investors might ""take profits and exit the product,"" said Rajappa. 
On a longer term horizon, investors see TIPS as a product to hold. Mark Heppenstall, CIO of Penn Mutual Asset Management, has not been adding to TIPS positions recently, but views them as a good ""diversifier in a fixed income portfolio"" with a unique hedging ability. 

Mike Kelly, head of multi asset at PineBridge Investments said if inflation picks up, three to four years out, ""gold and linkers (inflation protected bonds) will come into their own.""

83,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 08:20AM ET</span>",Game changer? How the recovery fund will shake up EU bond markets,"By Dhara Ranasinghe and Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union is about to vault into the ranks of the world's biggest supranational issuers after it gave the green light to a recovery fund financed via joint debt, a move that carries the potential to shake up euro debt markets.
EU leaders have agreed a deal on a 750 billion euro ($858 billion) fund to address COVID-19 damage; together with its seven-year budget, that unlocks a total 1.8 trillion euro spending boost.
Until now, the EU as an institution has contributed a fraction of the bloc's roughly 8.5 trillion euro market of government and agency bonds. But the money it's about to start raising could push its debt levels above that of member states such as Netherlands.
""For the first time, the European Union will be a major force on sovereign debt markets,"" said Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmieding. 
1. SUPER SPENDER
The EU currently has around 54 billion euros in outstanding debt, having borrowed nothing last year and just 5 billion euros in 2018. 
But if the entire 750 billion euros is raised on bond markets, issuance could amount to 262.5 billion euros next year and in 2022, with the remaining 225 billion euros coming in 2023, ING senior rates strategist Antoine Bouvet estimates.
In comparison, gross annual issuance from the European Investment Bank, EU, European Financial Stability Facility and European Stability Mechanism averaged 67 billion euros per year in 2015-19.
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development has roughly $201 billion of outstanding debt.
The EU also will borrow nearly 100 billion euros starting in September to fund its SURE unemployment scheme.
But the issuance won't significantly reduce bond supply from highly indebted states such as Italy just yet, given it will be spread out over some years.

Graphic: Common EU debt to shoot up - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/gjnpwxgdgvw/eikon.png
2. AAA ASSET
Financing the fund with joint EU bonds marks a big step towards mutualising member states' debt. 
""Such common liabilities for the European Union are unprecedented in size,"" said Sébastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.
It will also address one of the euro's drawbacks for reserve managers: the lack of a big pool of ""safe"" assets, comparable with U.S. Treasury bonds - a triple-A rated market worth over $17 trillion.
German, French and Italian bond markets combined are less than half that size, and only Germany carries the AAA score.
The EU however, has a triple-A rating from Moody's (NYSE:MCO), Fitch, DBRS and Scope. S&P Global rates it AA. Agencies suggest the upcoming debt surge is not yet a threat to the ratings.

3. GREEN BOOST
With the EU Commission planning to target 30% of the fund to climate projects, a third of the recovery fund could be financed via green bonds, S&P Global predicts. That would boost the size of the global green bond market by 89%. 
Green bonds currently comprise just 3.7% of global issuance.
""At a time where markets are looking for safe borrowers, this should be an example for other supranational institutions (like the World Bank) to finance badly needed investments, in particular to fight global warming,"" said Florence Pisani, global head of economic research at Candriam.

4. ECB RELIEF
The European Central Bank will also get an opportunity to ramp up purchases of supranational debt for its stimulus programme.
The first few months of the ECB's emergency bond-buying scheme launched in March saw it buy a smaller share of supra debt than usual, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) noted, but the bank expects up to 96 billion euros worth of fresh supra supply in coming months.
It expects the share of PEPP purchases of public bonds allocated to supranational debt could rise to at least 10% in the second half of 2020 from 7.5% now.

(Reuters) - Germany’s Robert Bosch GmbH, the world’s largest auto parts supplier, said on Tuesday it is consolidating its software and electronics expertise in a single division, in order to get new digitalized vehicle functions on the road significantly faster.
Bosch is the latest large automotive company to shift its emphasis from hardware to software as vehicles continue their transformation into mobile devices that combine transportation with digital services from e-commerce to infotainment — a trend driven heavily by electric car maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA).
Starting in early 2021, Bosch will draw together parts of its automotive electronics, chassis and powertrain divisions and combine them with its car multimedia division, with 17,000 employees in more than 20 countries.
""Supplying software from a single source is our response to the enormous challenge of making cars ever more digitalized,"" said Bosch board member Harald Kroeger, a former  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) executive and onetime Tesla board member who is spearheading the new division.
Bosch is joining a move by automakers such as Tesla, Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors Co (N:GM) and large suppliers such as Aptiv PLC (N:APTV) to consolidate many of the vehicle’s functions into a single digital “architecture.” Similar to what Tesla has been doing for more than five year, the consolidated system will oversee computers, control units and sensors, and can be more easily and quickly revised through wireless over-the-air updates.
Bosch said centralized computers and software in the vehicle will link such functions as automated driving, advanced driver assistance, digital dashboards and Internet connectivity.

Bosch supplies key components to many of the world's automakers, from Tesla to Daimler (OTC:DDAIF).

Stocks are set to build on Monday's exuberant tech rally, while earnings from Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN),  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and others are due. Jeff Bezos is $13 billion richer after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s surge on Monday, even though Prime Day is being delayed, and oil prices hit a four-month high on the general optimism. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, July 21st.
1. Europe's historic deal
The European Union’s member states finally agreed on a landmark deal that will create a 750 billion euro ($860 billion) recovery fund for the bloc.
The fund will be financed by borrowing by the EU itself, and over half of it – 390 billion euros in all – will be disbursed in the form of grants rather than loans.  As such it puts the firepower of German, Dutch and French taxpayers more solidly behind the credit of Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal.
Sovereign bonds and bank stocks across the southern European periphery all outperformed on the news, but the euro itself, was unchanged against the dollar, having hit a four-month high in anticipation of the news last week.
2. Republicans, Democrats set to thrash out stimulus package
U.S. policy-makers will meet again to thrash out details of what will be the fifth U.S. stimulus package since the coronavirus struck.
Various reports suggest the Republican and Democratic parties remain far away from each other’s position, but the fact that each controls one chamber of Congress  means that compromise will have to be found.
President Donald Trump said at the weekend he still wants a payroll tax cut to form part of the package, while Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday the measures would be worth around $1 trillion and would focus on “kids and jobs and vaccines.”
He also said the administration wants to provide tax incentives for businesses to rehire people and money for states that reopen schools. House Democrats are lobbying for more explicit support for states and cities, by contrast.
3. Stocks set to open higher after tech melt-up
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher again, extending gains made on Monday on the back of increased hope that one or more vaccine cures for the Covid-19 virus will be readily available by the end of the year.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 177 points or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 0.7% and the Nasdaq 100 Futures contract was up 0.8%
Stocks likely to be in focus will include Texas Instruments, Coca-Cola, Philip Morris and Lockheed Martin, all of which report before the open, as well as Snap, which reports after the close.
4. Bezos gains another $13 billion
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder and CEO Jeff Bezos’ net worth rose by $13 billion on Monday, in the latest sign of tech stock valuations de-anchoring from the reality of an economy in the middle its biggest contraction since World War 2.
Amazon stock rose 7.9% on Monday, helped by big upgrades from Wall Street analysts including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Jefferies (NYSE:JEF). However, the company said in an e-mail to suppliers it’s delaying its annual Prime Day, ostensibly due to the pandemic.
After the closing bell on Monday, IBM (NYSE:IBM) had joined the apparently unstoppable tech party, its shares rising over 5% in after-hours trading after it reported a 5.4% drop in revenue and a fall of nearly 50% in earnings per share for the second quarter. Those figures were marginally better than analysts’ expectations. Cloud-computing revenue rose 30% on the year,  IBM  noted.
5. Crude hits four-month high; API eyed
Crude oil prices hit their highest since early March as part of a generalized rally in risk assets after the EU deal.
By 6:30 AM U.S. crude futures were up 2.5% $41.95 a barrel, having earlier hit an intraday high of $42.02, while the international benchmark Brent was up 2.6% at $44.41 a barrel.
At 4:30 PM, the American Petroleum Institute will publish its latest weekly estimate of U.S. oil stocks. Analysts expect official government data, due on Wednesday, to show a fresh draw of 1.95 million barrels from crude inventories, after last week’s mammoth 7.5 million barrel draw."

YORK, S.C./LEVELLAND, Texas/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Ask a Federal Reserve official what is the most important step needed to get the economy on track from the body blow dealt by the coronavirus pandemic, and you will likely get a short and fast answer: Wear a mask.
It is a message now rolling out with greater repetition and urgency from the most influential U.S. economic players in both the public and private spheres as early signs of a fast recovery have begun to fade amid a resurgence of the disease in most states and rising deaths. (Open https://tmsnrt.rs/2WTOZDR in an external browser for a Reuters interactive)
In the absence of any uniform national policy from the Trump administration regarding the use of face coverings in public to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Fed officials have made mask wearing a centerpiece of their public appearances. And on Monday Walmart Inc (N:WMT) - the country's largest retailer and private employer - began requiring masks for shoppers in all of its stores, including the roughly one-third of its 5,000 U.S. locations in areas with no state or local mask mandate.
“Generally what we are seeing is customers complying with the face covering requirement,"" a company spokeswoman said. ""As we’ve seen in stores located in areas under a government mandate, customers are showing up with a face covering or putting one on when asked.” 
Federal Reserve officials have used their particular perch to try to spread the word. Regional reserve bank presidents keep a steady pace of appearances before local service clubs like the Rotary, Chamber of Commerce and other organizations.
Along with discussing the intricacies of Fed programs and monetary policy, they have become default hygiene coaches at a moment when success overcoming a global health crisis may hinge on small steps of personal responsibility.
""I overemphasize in my public comments wearing a mask because it's a message that everyone listening can act on,"" Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan told Reuters in an interview.
Kaplan, whose Fed district encompassing Texas and portions of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Louisiana has been hit hard in the latest leg of the outbreak, continued: ""I'm not the only one, but I'm one of several, that if I consistently emphasize this point and connect it to the economy ... and unemployment, maybe we can get more widespread adoption and maybe help to fight this virus.""
THE WALMART EFFECT
The move by Walmart is perhaps the broadest micro-level experiment yet in pushing behavior in that direction, one which economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) say is associated with ""significantly better"" coronavirus outcomes. According to their modeling, a national mask mandate would be as effective as a full lockdown and without the 5% hit to economic growth associated with full activity restrictions.
In York County, South Carolina - a state where the governor, Republican Henry McMaster, has refused to issue a mask mandate - there was some early indications of Walmart's influence.
Before the company's mask requirement kicked in, signs at Walmart's York store said masks ""are recommended while you shop."" During a 30-minute window on Friday afternoon, about a third of shoppers wore no mask as they were seen entering the store.
On Monday morning, the sign had changed to say masks were required and compliance appeared to have improved. Of those entering the store during another half-hour period, 119 had masks on before they entered. Only 16 did not, including three young children with their parents.
The great majority of shoppers also wore masks at two stores around Atlanta, where the Democratic mayor has imposed a mask mandate and the Republican governor has sued to stop it. Fewer than 30 shoppers out of about 300 observed in a 30-minute period at a store in McDonough, a Republican-leaning suburb, tried to enter the store without a mask on Monday afternoon and most of those accepted one offered by store staff at the entrance. Only three refused and left.
'I'M JUST STUBBORN'
At Walmart's store in Levelland, Texas, a conservative town of 13,500 people sitting on the sun-baked plains 30 miles west of Lubbock, most people wore masks upon entering on Monday, but the few who refused breezed into the store with no problems or confrontations. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, has mandated mask wearing in all counties with at least 20 cases, which includes Hockley County where Levelland sits.
In a 30-minute window around midday on Monday, 112 people entered the store wearing a mask while just seven walked in with no face covering at all. A Walmart employee at the door said nothing to those not wearing a mask.
One mask-less customer was a middle-aged woman wearing a red shirt with the words “FEAR NOT"" emblazoned in black lettering. The woman, who agreed to speak only if cited by her first name, Ashley, detailed several reasons for refusing to wear a face covering but said it mostly came down to one: ""I'm just stubborn, and I don't like people telling me what to do.""
Meanwhile, mask compliance was nearly 100% at a number of Walmart stores observed in areas that have had mask mandates for weeks or longer, such as Danbury, Connecticut and Chicago.
""I'm surprised Walmart has to tell people to wear masks at all; it’s ludicrous,"" said Amy Arenson, 54, a homemaker who regularly shops at the Walmart Neighborhood Market in Chicago's Boystown neighborhood.

""What's the big deal? It's like wearing pants. You have to wear pants when you go shopping and then you can take them off when you go home. No one has to force you to wear pants and they shouldn't have to force you to wear a mask.""

BUENOS AIRES/LONDON (Reuters) - Argentina's government rejected a counterproposal from the country's three main creditor groups on Monday to revamp around $65 billion in foreign debt, doubling down on its own ""final"" offer as bondholders appeared to close ranks.
Economy Minister Martin Guzman said the latest debt restructuring offer, the first from the three groups together, reflected a ""lack of understanding"" of the limitations faced by the crisis-stricken South American nation.
""Accepting what some creditors ask for would mean subjecting Argentine society to more anguish,"" Guzman said in a statement. ""It would imply, for example, adjusting pensions, and we will not do it.""
The two sides are racing to reach an agreement to restructure around $65 billion in foreign debt before a government-set deadline of Aug. 4, looking to avoid a messy and protracted legal standoff after recession-hit Argentina slipped into default in May.
Argentina's government made a ""final"" offer in July after talks broke down. Center-left President Alberto Fernandez and Guzman have since repeatedly said it was the maximum the country could offer.
The three groups -- the Ad Hoc group, Argentina Creditor Committee and Exchange Bondholder Group -- said their proposal, issued earlier on Monday, made ""significant economic and legal concessions."" They all agreed to oppose the government offer.
""Our three groups have also signed a cooperation agreement reaffirming that Argentina's current offer falls short of a proposal that can be supported by the creditor groups,"" they said, adding they would not tender their bonds under the offer.
The new creditor proposal puts the weighted average of the net present value (NPV) at 55.70 cents, according to a presentation seen by Reuters. Analysts had calculated the NPV of the government offer at 53-54 cents. 
The unified opposition from the groups, which together hold more than a third of both Argentina's ""global"" bonds and its ""Exchange"" bonds, will make it tough for the government to get a comprehensive deal on its current offer.
The groups added, however, that a deal could still be struck.
""We are confident that a consensual resolution is in sight and that such an agreement will provide a path towards a sustainable economic future for Argentina's people,"" they said.
The three groups said their new proposal included an ""amended version of the 2016 indenture"" for eligible global bonds, a reference to the key legal clauses that have been a point of contention.
Guzman reiterated the government's offer was its ""maximum effort"" and he believed that most creditors would accept it.
Hans Humes, CEO of Greylock Capital, which was one of the prominent voices in the ACC committee before it exited the group and tendered its bonds, said there was a risk that some were misreading the reality of the Argentine situation.
""We may have been able to get concessions on legal language and adviser fees,"" the distressed debt veteran said. ""But not the net present value (NPV) that Argentina has said no to many times.""

The country's sovereign bonds, which have been buffeted since last year over concerns of a default, edged down 0.5% in on Monday. They have risen over recent months on hopes of a deal.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Demand for Kenya's flowers has recovered to around 85% of pre-coronavirus levels as European markets open up after lockdowns, an industry body said, spurring hope that the industry could see a full rebound by next year. 
Kenyan farmers were forced to throw away millions of roses in March as Europe sealed borders and residents put weddings and funerals on hold. 
But demand is coming back as restrictions ease and growers are hoping it will recover fully by next year, said Clement Tulezi, chief executive of the Kenya Flower Council. 
""We are better than we were two months ago, demand is almost at 85%,"" Tulezi told Reuters. ""From our major markets in Europe and elsewhere, we are seeing orders."" 
Europe accounts for nearly 70% of Kenya's cut flower exports and coronavirus restrictions had slashed daily orders by half, threatening thousands of jobs in East Africa's richest economy.
Kenyan farmer Inder Nain, whose company Xflora group used to export 350,000 roses a day, saw exports plunge to 50,000 a day in March. Now, that's rebounded to about 250,000, he said, and his 2,000 employees are back at work. 
""We are seeing good and steady recovery,"" Nain told Reuters. 
Flower exports are one of Kenya's top three foreign exchange earners and generated nearly a billion dollars in sales in 2019. 
But like all nations, the coronavirus has battered the economy. Growth is projected to slow to 2.5% this year from 5.4% last year. 
Flower sellers are still nervous about high freight costs caused by a drop in airline traffic and uncertainty over whether there will be a second coronavirus wave in Europe, Nain said.
""We are still throwing some flowers away but it's quite different from when we were throwing every stem,"" Nain said. ""We hope by February the disease will be controlled and things will return to normal.""
But exporters also say they cannot fully meet demand, which will be seasonally high in September in Europe, because of limited cargo capacity and high freight costs.

""We are not sure freight capacity and costs will be moving in tandem with demand,"" said Tulezi.

BRUSSELS/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Hungary, Poland and the Netherlands all claimed victory on Tuesday after a European Union summit left open how to tie a new coronavirus recovery fund to democratic values, raising doubts about whether compliance would be possible or meaningful.
EU leaders negotiated a 750 billion euro ($859.05 billion) post-pandemic fund and 1.1 trillion euro budget after almost five days of talks in Brussels, but conditions for payouts on rule-of-law were not detailed in the final statement.
EU leaders agreed to ""a regime of conditionality to protect the budget"", leaving it up to the European Commission, the EU executive, to propose measures. However, all 27 EU states would have to agree to a new mechanism.
EU rules already allow for ways to sanction democratic breaches, but they are hard to implement and many EU leaders want something more direct, concerned by the increasing authoritarianism of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
The vague language paled in comparison to earlier promises of tough conditions. The EU prides itself on media freedom and human rights. The European Commission, lawmakers, experts and activists say freedoms are under threat in Poland and Hungary. 
""The core of what was proposed in the drafts is still there, and that's crucial,"" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said of the final summit communique. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also said that: ""In our conclusions we are committed to accept and protect ... the principles of respect for the rule of law.""
But Orban told reporters he had ""thwarted and repelled"" efforts to tie disbursement of funds to democratic values. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki hailed the ""whole architecture of supervision"" as a success. 
Daniel Hegedus at the German Marshall Fund think-tank said the situation was more nuanced. 

The summit ""did not agree on a specific rule of law conditionality mechanism ... but Morawiecki and Orban's claim that they ward of the introduction of conditionality in the new budget is not in accordance with the facts,"" Hegedus told Reuters.

The Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link, as the project is known, was suspended last year after the former Malaysian administration led by Mahathir Mohamad pledged to tighten finances and review major deals.
The countries had earlier this year agreed to a July 31 deadline to finalise the project, after talks were hit by movement curbs to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
Malaysia's Transport Minister Wee Ka Siong said the agreement will be signed on the Johor Causeway - the main thoroughfare for land traffic between Malaysia and Singapore - in a brief ceremony to be witnessed by both prime ministers.
""Our expectation is by the end of 2026, we will see the start of RTS operations between Johor Bahru and Singapore,"" Wee said at a news conference in parliament.
Wee said the total cost of the project would be 3.75 billion ringgit ($880.28 million), including the construction of a maintenance depot which was not included in the earlier estimate.
Singapore is paying 61% of the costs and Malaysia 39%, a transport official said.
Mahathir had said in October that the project cost was cut by a third from about 4.93 billion ringgit to 3.16 billion ringgit after discussions between both countries.
In March, a new Malaysian government led by Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin was sworn in after Mahathir's sudden resignation.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (O:ZM) said on Tuesday it will open a technology centre in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru and soon begin hiring as part of an expansion push in the country.
Potential areas of expansion for the new technology centre include research and development, IT, security as well business operations, Velchamy Sankarlingam, Zoom's president of product and engineering, told a virtual news conference.
San Jose, California-based Zoom already has an office and a data centre in India's financial capital Mumbai and a second data centre in Bengaluru.
It could add more local data centres based on its growth needs, Sankarlingam said. The company did not disclose investment plans for India or the number of people it planned to hire.
Use of Zoom's video conferencing services has surged at a time people across the world are working from home due to coronavirus curbs, but the company has also come under fire over privacy and security issues, spurring it to roll out major upgrades.
India has previously said Zoom is ""not a safe platform"", joining other countries in expressing concern about the security of its services.
""Zoom has reached out and engaged with the Indian government and so far we're optimistic,"" Zoom's Chief Operating Officer Aparna Bawa said, without elaborating.

It competes with Cisco Systems Inc's (O:CSCO) Webex,  Microsoft Corp 's (O:MSFT) Teams and Google's (O:GOOGL) Meet platform. Its Indian rivals include Reliance's (NS:RELI) JioMeet and Bluejeans, a Verizon (N:VZ) application that has been customised for India by  Bharti Airtel  (NS:BRTI).

96,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 04:30AM ET</span>",UK borrows record 128 billion pounds in three months to June,"By David Milliken and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - British government borrowing surged to a record 128 billion pounds ($162 billion) in the first three months of the 2020/21 financial year, when COVID-19 lockdown measures were tightest, more than double the entire previous year's borrowing.
Most economists think British government borrowing this year will be its largest since World War Two relative to the size of the economy. 
Borrowing in June, excluding state-owned banks, was 35.5 billion pounds, the government statistics office said. That was five times more than a year earlier though below economists' average forecast of 41.5 billion pounds in a Reuters poll, following a big downward revision for May.
April, May and June made up the three highest months of borrowing in Britain's history, even though spending on job support was lower than first estimated, and tax revenues higher, the Office for National Statistics said.
""Borrowing is still rising at an exceptional rate and we suspect that a slowdown in the recovery and further rise in unemployment later this year will prompt the government to announce additional fiscal spending at the next Budget,"" said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics.
(GRAPHIC - Pandemic prompts unprecedented surge in UK borrowing: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/gjnvwxgogpw/Pasted%20image%201595318097774.png) 
Last week finance minister Rishi Sunak set out up to 30 billion pounds of new measures, partly to encourage businesses to take workers back when he ends a furlough scheme supporting more than 9 million jobs in October.
Public sector debt, excluding state-owned banks, stayed a fraction below the milestone of 100% of gross domestic product it appeared to pass in May, after an upward revision to GDP, and now stands at 1.984 trillion pounds or 99.6% of GDP.
This is still the highest debt burden since the 1960s, the statistics office said.
""Over the medium-term, we must, and we will, put our public finances back on a sustainable footing,"" Sunak said on Tuesday.
Bond markets have been happy to finance this borrowing, however. Last week Britain sold a three-year bond with a record-low negative yield - meaning investors will receive back less than they lent - and longer-term borrowing costs are also near a record low.
Britain's government has announced extra spending and tax cuts worth around 192 billion pounds for this financial year, and last week its Office for Budget Responsibility estimated borrowing would hit 322 billion pounds or just over 16% of GDP. 
This figure is based on a scenario where the economy shrinks by 12.4% over 2020, and the unemployment rate rises to its highest since 1984 at 11.9% by the end of this year.

97,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 03:30AM ET</span>",Conte: EU recovery fund gives chance to 'change the face' of Italy,"ROME (Reuters) - Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Tuesday the EU stimulus plan would allow his government to transform Italy and help the bloc as a whole face the COVID-19 crisis with ""strength and effectiveness"".
Conte said that 28%, or 209 billion euros, of the 750 billion euros agreed at the European summit would be for Italy, of which 81 billion euros will be in grants and 127 billion euros will be in loans. 
The deal gives Italy ""the opportunity to restart with strength"" and the government the responsibility ""to change the face of the country,"" Conte said.
""Now we have to run and use these funds for investments and structural reforms. We have a real chance to make Italy greener, more digital, more innovative, more sustainable, inclusive. We have the chance to invest in schools, universities, research and infrastructures.""
Conte dismissed rumours that his government was on the verge of breakdown saying that the administration ""is strong"" and the EU deal ""reinforces the Italian government's action"".
Italy’s ruling parties are divided over whether to use the European Union bailout fund managed by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which Italy has always declined to use in the past to avoid tough fiscal conditions.
""My position never changed: ESM is not our goal,"" Conte said, adding that he hoped the deal on the Recovery Fund ""could contribute to distract morbid attention surrounding the ESM"".

Talking about the long negotiations in Brussels, Conte said that he protected ""the dignity of Italy and the autonomy of the EU institutions and rejected insidious attempts to alter the genuine vocation of the European project by cross vetoes"".

98,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 03:27AM ET</span>",The Inside Story of How Europe Landed Its Massive Stimulus Plan,"(Bloomberg) -- On Friday morning Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron were sipping mineral water on a sunlit terrace overlooking Brussels as negotiations began on a 750 billion-euro ($860 billion) European stimulus package they’d sketched out two months earlier.
By the early hours of Monday, the leaders of Germany and France were refueling on potato chips and wine as they battled to hold the talks together.
“Crunchtime,” said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, as he joined them for yet another side meeting with Italy’s Giuseppe Conte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
With the economy reeling from the effects of the pandemic and investors looking for a response, the plan that Merkel and Macron had come up with would mean a historic step forward for the European project if they could pull it off.
This was the moment it finally started to come together.
Rarely has a meeting of the European Union’s 27 leaders so dramatically exposed the divisions between them. And yet they’ve emerged at the end of it with an agreement that may well come to be considered a watershed in the long, uncertain process of EU integration.

This account of one of the most difficult negotiations in the EU’s 63-year history is based on reports from officials inside the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions.
As the group gathered Friday to meet in person for the first time since the pandemic struck, they knew where the dividing lines were.
The outcome of the summit would hinge on persuading Rutte and his allies from Austria, Denmark and Sweden to accept an unprecedented transfer of resources to the southern economies that had suffered the most from the outbreak. The initial proposal by European Council President Charles Michel involved making 500 billion euros available as handouts to avoid piling more debt onto their strained balance sheets.
Under EU rules, the deal would need unanimity.
Attack on the Commission
But the good-natured conversations of Friday morning descended into a war of words by Friday night as Rutte attacked the commission for its track record in ensuring member states manage their finances.
Von der Leyen, the commission chief, sat silently as Rutte reminded the group of occasions when the EU executive had failed to enforce financial rules. Diplomats asked themselves why on earth she wasn’t defending the institution she’s led since December.
The Dutch leader said the atmosphere had been “cranky.”
The pandemic has seen a resurgence of the partnership between Merkel, who celebrated her 66th birthday on the first day of the talks, and 42 year-old Macron.
She’s come to the fore for one more crisis as her chancellorship draws to a close. He has been calling for EU integration since his 2017 election victory. Together, they agreed that 500 billion euros of grants should be the starting point in the negotiations.
On Saturday morning, with Rutte and his allies refusing to accept that amount of handouts, Michel issued a new proposal, this time calling for 450 billion euros in grants. That night Merkel and Macron met with Rutte as they tried to find a way forward and left, abruptly, after their efforts hit a wall.
“They are walking away grumpy,” said Rutte, knowing he’d have to take any deal for ratification to a Dutch parliament where he has exactly 50% of the seats.
‘Blackmail’
By Sunday lunchtime, the atmosphere had gotten so bad that diplomats on all sides were warning that the talks could collapse at any moment, a devastating failure that could send financial markets reeling.
“Europe is being blackmailed,” Italy’s Conte told reporters.
Conte and Rutte faced off at a meeting that afternoon where the Italian leader accused his Dutch counterpart of being deluded.
Two officials with knowledge of the exchange said that Conte told Rutte his intransigence might make him a hero for a day at home but it would come at a high cost for Europe in the long run, though that account was disputed by a Dutch official.
Conte, a university law professor before he entered politics, was outraged by Dutch demands for a veto on individual disbursements, telling Rutte that it wasn’t consistent with EU law.
All the same, the two sides were starting to move.
Michel’s next proposal called for 400 billion euros of grants. Rutte and his allies said they could go to 350 billion.
Macron and Merkel met with leaders of eastern countries concerned their payments would only come through if they respected the independence of institutions like the courts and the media.
Commission Riposte
Dinner on Sunday was cold meats and salad around 7 p.m.
Von der Leyen responded to Rutte’s criticism from Friday and got a round of applause from other leaders. An angry Macron accused the holdouts of ignoring financial realities and then scolded Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz for getting up to take a phone call.
“We negotiated for 20 hours,” Kurz said later. “I find that stepping out is sometimes quite normal.”
“It is understandable that some people, if they get little sleep, at some point lose their cool,” he added.
As the clock ticked past midnight into day four, the fiscal hawks held frantic discussions over a bowl of cherries. Portugal’s Antonio Costa sprawled out on a sofa as he waited for all the leaders to reconvene. Aides napped in the corridors.
Merkel and Macron huddled with Conte and von der Leyen before calling Rutte into the meeting.
Breakthrough
That’s where they found the wording on governance of the fund that both Italy and the Netherlands could live with. Rutte left the meeting telling Italian officials outside that the new language meant that he had no veto. A consensus started to form around 390 billion euros of grants.
By the time the delegations left the Europa building some time after dawn, officials from the hardline camp were saying they could do a deal.
Monday was about fleshing out the details and mending bridges as officials combed Brussels for extra underwear and fresh face masks.
Merkel had clashed with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Sunday. To make up for the incident, she bought her counterpart chocolates they shared them on the sidelines of the talks.
By dinner -- carrot soup, cod and lemon cake -- all 27 were broadly satisfied, but they were still pushing for more as the details were settled.
Italian officials celebrated when Conte won a change in the leaders’ obligations when overseeing the fund -- objections would have to be analyzed not “decisively” but “exhaustively.” The Danes got more than 50 million euros added to their budget rebate arguing that there was a typo in the text. At the last minute, provisions aimed at halting sliding democratic standards were diluted.
Even then, leaders had to wait several hours for the paperwork to be finalized. Danish officials talked movies, the Lithuanians played chess, Kurz returned to the Austrian delegation room with his team and sipped Diet Coke as they swapped reflections about the previous four days.
Shortly after 5 a.m. Tuesday, the 27 leaders gathered one last time on the fifth floor of the Europa Building. Afterwards Rutte joked that they had been within touching distance of eclipsing the longest ever summit from 2000. But more importantly, the deal was done.
“When you have negotiations that are as intense as these, they trigger emotions on the part of all participants, they release adrenaline,” Michel said afterward. “Sometimes you get the feeling that it’s not going to work, sometimes you feel you might need to give up, sometimes you feel you just have to roll your sleeves up and push on.”

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's economic growth will slow to 3.1% in the fiscal year 2020/2021 that began this month due to the coronavirus pandemic, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday, down from 3.5% forecast in a similar poll three months ago.
The country's economy had been boosted in the last three years by an upswing in tourism, strong remittances from Egyptian workers abroad and recently discovered natural gas fields coming onstream.
But since the coronavirus outbreak, tourism has collapsed, the price of gas has plummeted, and worker remittances have come under threat with the decline of oil revenues in Gulf Arab states, where many Egyptians are employed.
The government was expecting growth of 3.5% in the fiscal year 2020/21, which began in July, but growth could slow to 2% if the coronavirus crisis continues until year-end, Planning Minister Hala al-Saeed said in May.
The July 7-20 poll predicted Egypt's gross domestic product (GDP) growth would recover in 2021/2022 to 5.0%. 
""Egypt's GDP in the first half of 2020/21 is expected to be negatively affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in Egypt with tourism, private investment and consumption being the main components negatively affected,"" said HC Securities' research team.
""As we go into FY 2021/22, we expect this negative effect to fade out and the economy to start capitalizing on the 2016-2019 economic reform,"" they added.
The economists polled by Reuters expected Egypt's annual urban consumer price inflation to slow to 7.0% in 2020/21, down from 7.5% expected in the previous poll. They predicted inflation would remain unchanged at 7.0% in 2021/22.
""Although the economy is slowly reopening, domestic demand conditions will likely remain subdued going forward as salaries are reduced and workers are laid off amid the economic downturn. This coupled with a relatively strong currency should keep inflation low in months to come,"" said Callee Davis, an economist at NKC African Economics.

101,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 01:27AM ET</span>",Dates to Watch as Governments Face a Fiscal Cliff Edge,"(Bloomberg) -- Governments that raced to the rescue as the coronavirus hit their economies now face the dilemma of whether to extend their massive bailouts of businesses and labor markets.
So-called cliff edges are emerging around the world as programs head for their expiry dates. The decision policy makers must make is whether to continue pumping cash into their economies in the hope of driving a rebound from the recession.
The risks of doing so are that the longer the intervention lasts, the bigger budget deficits will swell, and the return to business as normal will be delayed.
Here are the key dates in the Group of Seven economies, with analysis from Bloomberg Economics:
GERMANY
Companies and households don’t face a “cliff edge” so much as a slow petering out of multiple support measures that are likely to be reassessed and adapted as needed. That’s because one of the most significant policies -- wage subsidies for furloughed workers -- has been around in some form for more than a century, and companies regularly use it in times of economic weakness. The government offers up to 12 months of support, or as much as 21 months for businesses which began making use of it last year.
As for other measures, 25 billion euros ($29 billion) of liquidity injections for small and medium-sized enterprises are due to expire at the end of August, while other tools such as a sales-tax cut and loan guarantees are set to last longer. Companies generally point to the Fall as the point when they see aid becoming scarce, though Germany’s economy minister has said the government will reassess the situation at that point to see if further help is needed.WHAT OUR ECONOMISTS SAY: “By getting on top of the virus early and offering huge fiscal support, a substantial part of Germany’s economy will see a V-shaped recovery. Even so, some businesses won’t be back to normal capacity this year, or perhaps at all. The danger is that generous wage support delays a necessary reallocation of labor.” – Jamie Rush
FRANCE
The French government already reduced its financing for furloughs in June by leaving employers in most sectors to cover a slightly larger share of the cost of paying idled workers. Starting in October, the current system will be replaced by a new, standardized mechanism that is less generous for both employers and employees. However, France has also introduced a new tool that covers a larger chunk of lost incomes for up to two years if unions and businesses strike deals, typically including job guarantees.
State loan guarantees will be available to the end of the year, but the government is working on new tools to avoid a cliff edge. That would involve injecting some form of equity into smaller companies in collaboration with banks and private sector funds.
As part of its crisis fighting package, France also set up a “solidarity fund” to provide direct grants to cover the lost income of the self-employed and very small companies during the lockdown. Around 5 billion euros have been tapped from the fund, which remained open through June and will be available for the worst-hit sectors until the end of 2020.
WHAT OUR ECONOMISTS SAY: “The French government is gradually moving from blanket insurance to targeted aid and has already pledged to maintain generous support for the hospitality and tourism sectors, while tightening conditions for other businesses. This step by step approach is likely to pay off but won’t prevent job losses, as parts of the economy slowly rescale to the new environment.” - Maeva Cousin
U.S.
The most dangerous deadline in the U.S. looms at the end of July when extra unemployment payments of $600 a week are due to run out. Congress is deadlocked over whether to extend them. With jobless rates still near Great Depression-era levels, the Treasury paid out some $116 billion of the benefits in June –- equivalent to more than 6% of last year’s monthly GDP.
A mini-cliff comes at the end of September, when the freeze on student-debt repayments, which the New York Fed says is saving Americans about $7 billion a month, is set to end. It’s also when the government’s payroll support for the biggest U.S. airlines, worth $25 billion, is scheduled to run out. United Airlines already told almost half its U.S.-based workforce that their jobs will be at risk from the start of October.

WHAT OUR ECONOMISTS SAY: “If no action is taken, U.S. consumers will find themselves between a rock and a hard place with delayed payments coming due and no money to pay them. We believe Congress will agree on extended aid by the end of July. Still, less generous terms and an untamed virus means after an initial rebound, the recovery is set to be slow and shallow.” -- Yelena Shulyatyeva
CANADA
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is searching for a way to shift citizens from a C$2000 ($1,470) per month benefit fund back into the workforce. The C$80 billion Canada Emergency Response Benefit runs until Oct. 3 -- a recently published government fiscal snapshot revealed plans to begin a transition in September.
The C$82 billion wage subsidy plan, which gives employers 75% of salaries for workers kept on the books, is is being extended until December. The administration’s most successful business program is the Canada Emergency Business Account, which provides C$40,000 interest-free loans with C$10,000 of that forgivable. Companies need to apply by Aug. 31 to receive the money and have until Dec. 31, 2022, to repay the government to benefit from the forgiveness.WHAT OUR ECONOMISTS SAY: “Well-targeted income support has been essential -- and expensive -- enabled by a strong federal fiscal backdrop ahead of the crisis. A minority government for PM Trudeau and the Liberals means each extension of aid will be a delicate process. On the left flank, the NDP warns against premature rollback while advocating a wealth tax, while Conservatives stress the worsening fiscal profile. Minority governments in Canada have difficulty lasting more than two years, and fault lines are brewing.” – Andrew Husby
U.K.
The U.K. will begin tapering its furlough program -- which has helped support more than 9 million jobs by paying 80% of their wages – in August, with employers gradually taking on more of the burden until it comes to an end on Oct. 31.That’s also the date on which support for 2.7 million self-employed workers will finish. Meanwhile, other stimulus measures announced by Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak in July also have a firm end-date. The reduction in sales tax for hospitality firms expires on Jan. 12, while the removal of a levy of the first 500,000 pounds ($627,000) of any house purchases runs out on March 31.WHAT OUR ECONOMISTS SAY: “As support is withdrawn in coming months, the hope is that the reopening of the economy will provide enough impetus to demand for most jobs to remain viable. More likely, consumer caution will hold the recovery back and a second wave of unemployment will hit in the Fall.” – Dan Hanson
ITALY
Italy’s government plans to extend a ban on layoffs that is due to expire Aug. 17 until the end of the year. Furloughs have already been extended to 18 weeks from 14 weeks. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said the country “doesn’t abandon workers” and will do whatever is needed to keep supporting the economy.So far Italy has passed 75 billion euros-worth of stimulus measures to prop up companies and workers damaged by the pandemic, and further measures are planned in July. A further 500 billion in government backed loans is available to small and medium-sized companies that have been damaged by the pandemic.
WHAT OUR ECONOMISTS SAY: “The Italian government eventually opened its purse strings wide, but the relief came late in the day. In all likelihood, some firms will go bankrupt and jobs will be lost. This damage will be hard to reverse.” – David Powell
JAPAN
March 31 is the current cliff edge for the Bank of Japan’s two lending programs and its additional buying of corporate bonds and commercial paper.The 100,000 yen ($930) universal cash handouts approved at the end of April must be applied for within three months of the start date -- the time each local government started accepting applications varies.The deadline for applications for cash to help freelancers and small firms is Jan. 15. Japan’s furlough equivalent is an ongoing program that has been ramped up on a temporary basis until Sept. 30 this year to pay up to 80% more per day.
WHAT OUR ECONOMISTS SAY: “Japan’s debt problem is getting so bad, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s administration doesn’t even want to think about it anymore -- that’s the uncharitable interpretation of its decision to not to include a road map for fiscal consolidation in this year’s basic economic policy framework, a first since Abe revived the annual big-picture policy plans in 2013. In reality, it was probably more a practical decision: the government’s focus is now squarely on rescuing the economy.” – Yuki Masujima

DUBAI (Reuters) - Economic activity in the Gulf will contract sharply this year before recovering in 2021, hit by the double shock of the coronavirus pandemic and an oil price crash, a quarterly Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.
Analysts in the July 7-20 poll see a deep economic contraction in the hydrocarbon-producing region this year as oil prices were hit on the supply and demand sides simultaneously.
Saudi Arabia's GDP was seen shrinking 5.2% this year before rebounding to 3.1% growth next year. A similar poll conducted three months ago saw the region's biggest economy and world's largest oil exporter growing 1.0% in 2020 and 2.0% in 2021.
In March, a Saudi-Russian price war caused oil prices to plummet, and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies subsequently implemented output cuts.
""Three months ago, most forecasts didn't yet factor in the oil production cuts or the full extent of the COVID-19 fallout,"" said Maya Senussi, senior economist at Oxford Economics, adding that limiting the hajj pilgrimage, an important source of tourism revenue, also weighed on Saudi Arabia's outlook.
Kuwait's GDP was seen shrinking the most out of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members, contracting 6.1% in 2020 before growing 2.5% next year. Three months ago, it was seen shrinking 2.9% in 2020 and growing 2.0% next year.
Medians forecast a 5.1% contraction for the United Arab Emirates' economy this year and 2.6% growth in 2021. Three months ago, they expected the economy to shrink 0.4% this year.
Tourism, a major source of revenue for the emirate of Dubai, has been hit hard by lockdown measures and travel restrictions.
""We expect revenues for the tourism and hospitality sectors to be under particular pressure given an expected sharp decline in the visitor numbers,"" S&P Global Ratings said in a research note, adding that it continues to observe ""broad-based pressures across various sectors"" in the GCC.
Qatar, Oman and Bahrain's outlooks also worsened for this year, with analysts expecting their economies to shrink 4.0%, 4.7% and 4.4% respectively. Their growth outlooks for 2021 improved from expectations three months ago.

""While activity is now picking up across much of the region as lockdown restrictions are relaxed, the pace of recovery in H2 and beyond may disappoint, particularly with the coronavirus set to linger,"" Oxford Economics said in a research note.

Office workers who can telecommute have generally been able to retain their income, while many blue-collar workers who have to be on site to work are among the tens of millions of Americans who lost their jobs as the country went into lockdown.
Now, as states struggle with lifting shelter-in-place rules that would allow the most economically vulnerable to return to work, new research shows that people in low-wage jobs are more likely to work in close proximity to other people, and thus face increased risks of exposure to the novel coronavirus than people in high-paying jobs.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Business leaders and investors are urging Thailand's government to pick a new economic team as soon as possible to help steer Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy through the coronavirus crisis.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has said a cabinet reshuffle will take place by August after Finance Minister Uttama Savanayana, economic policy czar Somkid Jatusripitak and four other ministers resigned since last week. 
The new team will have to deal with an economy sliding into a deep recession and handle billions of dollars in stimulus as jobs disappear amid a record slump in tourism.. 
""This crisis is big. There are 7 to 8 million job losses. Exports and tourism are not good. It's difficult to find people to work (for the jobs), said Paiboon Nalinthrangkurn, chairman of the Federation of Thai Capital Market Organizations.
Several people have already declined approaches to join the team, while Prayuth said he was awaiting a response from banking executive Preedee Daochai, who is tipped to be the new finance minister.
Nuttachart Mekmasin at Trinity Securities said posts needed to be filled quickly to reassure markets, noting a target by next month was already slow.
""There should not be too much negotiation since investors and businesses are waiting for stimulus measures,"" he said.
Central bank governor Veerathai Santiprabhob said on Monday the recent fall in the baht  has been driven by economic and political concerns, but said capital outflows were not a worry yet.
Foreign investors have dumped about 220 billion baht ($6.91 billion) of Thai shares this year and 101 billion baht of bonds.
(GRAPHIC - Thailand's economy has lagged regional peers for years: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprrzzxpe/Pasted%20image%201595233559929.png) 
Control Risks, a consultancy, said wrangling in Prayuth's Palang Pracharat Party and among coalition members ""could delay the finalisation of the reshuffle by up to two months, which is likely to hurt investor confidence"".
A delay would also affect the selection of a new central bank governor to succeed Veerathai, whose term ends on Sept. 30. The finance minister picks a new governor.
While no big changes are expected in the government's 1 trillion baht borrowing for coronavirus support measures, ""there may be some concerns over the execution of fiscal measures,"" said Nomura economist Charnon Boonnuch.
There is also potential for a flare-up in political risk after protesters defied a coronavirus ban on gatherings to stage one of the largest street demonstrations against the government since a 2014 military coup.
""If the emergency decree ends and protesters return, it will be a political risk,"" said Poon Panichpibool, market strategist at Krung Thai Bank.
Thailand has reported no new local coronavirus cases for two months and the government is considering whether to extend the emergency decree that lapses on July 31.
Kalin Sarasin, chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, said the new economic team will need to attract investment for an economy which the central bank predicts will shrink by a record 8.1% this year.

""We want people who know how to work and restore confidence,"" said Kalin.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's economy likely saw its biggest contraction in over 20 years in the second quarter, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday, as the coronavirus pandemic hit consumer spending, the labour market, and global demand for its exports.
Asia's fourth largest economy is expected to have shrunk a median 2.0% in the April-June period from a year ago, according to a poll of 19 economists, its sharpest contraction since 1998. The economy grew 1.4% in the first quarter of 2020.
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, gross domestic product (GDP) likely shrank a seasonally adjusted 2.3% in the same period, its biggest quarterly fall since late 2008, after contracting by 1.3% in the first three months of the year.
The spread of the virus in March and April hit the export-led economy hard, said Hana Financial Investment economist Chun Kyu-yeon, as its major trading partners imposed lockdown restrictions to contain the outbreak.
""Consumption has inevitably slowed due to the impact on the job market, while weakened demand from advanced economies also dragged down exports by a huge margin,"" she said.
The fallout comes even as the government rolled out around 277 trillion won ($231.23 billion) worth of stimulus, which included emergency cash payments to all families, while the central bank cut interest rates to support the economy.
Even though infections have plateaued locally in recent months, the country's exports continue to be hit by falling global demand due to the pandemic.
Shipments plunged 20.3% during the second quarter, the sharpest in 11 years and compared to a 1.8% decline in the March quarter. Exports made up 33% of South Korea's nominal GDP in 2019.
Meanwhile, a separate Reuters poll of 22 economists showed full-year 2020 GDP was forecast to shrink 0.4%, which would also be the biggest decline since 1998. The economy expanded 2.0% last year.
The Bank of Korea in May slashed its 2020 growth projections to a 0.2% decline, but the bank's governor said on Thursday that downward revisions would be unavoidable.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects South Korea's economy to contract 2.1% this year.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's top central banker on Tuesday urged the government to borrow more and boost public spending to support the country's economic recovery as that would be ""the right thing to do in the national interest.""
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe said the foundations of the Australian economy were strong with solid public balance sheets.
He said monetary and fiscal policy measures were also helping to provide ""an important bridge"" to recovery as Australia faces its worst economic shock since the 1930s with the unemployment rate at a 22-year high.
In a speech titled ""COVID 19, the Labour Market and Public-sector Balance Sheets"", Lowe said direct cash transfers to households and businesses as well as boosting public spending on infrastructure and wage subsidy schemes were examples of how the government could ""smooth things out"".
""By helping the economy today, these measures also support the all-important confidence,"" he added.
""So they assist with a return to more normal patterns of spending and consumption, without the need for ongoing fiscal stimulus.""
The remarks come as Australia is set to trim the size of its wage subsidy payments and tighten the eligibility rules.
Lowe said using the public balance sheet in this manner inevitably required increased government borrowing.
""For a country that has got used to low budget deficits and low levels of public debt, this is quite a change. But it is a change that is entirely manageable and affordable and it’s the right thing to do in the national interest,"" Lowe said.
For its part, the RBA has slashed interest rates to a record low 0.25% and launched an unlimited government bond buying programme.
On Tuesday, Lowe ruled out negative interest rates and intervention in the foreign exchange markets as possible policy options.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank saw no need to adjust its policy measures in the current environment, minutes of its July policy meeting showed on Tuesday, while board members reiterated that negative interest rates remained ""extraordinarily unlikely"". 
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) had, on July 7, left the cash rate at 0.25% in a widely expected decision and said the ""accommodative approach will be maintained as long as it is required"". 
Its package of measures includes the cash rate at 0.25%, an ""unlimited"" government bond buying programme, term funding facility for banks and an interest rate of 10 basis points on exchange settlement balances held by financial institutions at the RBA.
""Members agreed, however, to continue to assess the evolving situation in Australia and did not rule out adjusting the current package if circumstances warranted,"" the minutes showed.
The coronavirus has crippled business and consumer activity across Australia where unemployment is running at a 22-year high as the nation braces for its first recession in nearly three decades. 
The RBA has repeatedly said the shock to the Australian economy from the pandemic would be the most severe since the 1930s, while the outlook remained highly uncertain.
The July policy meeting took place when Australia's second most populous state of Victoria had just started to see a spike in coronavirus cases, forcing authorities to re-introduce strict mobility restrictions including shutting its border with neighbouring New South Wales.
The RBA minutes also reiterated, citing a speech by Governor Philip Lowe in November 2019, that negative interest rates were extraordinarily unlikely.
There was no case for intervention in the foreign exchange market either, ""given its limited effectiveness when the exchange rate is broadly aligned with its fundamental determinants, as at present.""

Governor Lowe is set to give a speech at 0300 GMT Tuesday on the topic ""COVID 19, the Labour Market and Public-sector Balance Sheets.""

Over a four-year period, UBS Financial Services Inc improperly allocated bonds intended for retail customers to parties known in the industry as “flippers,” who immediately resold the bonds to other broker-dealers at a profit, the agency said in a statement. 
UBS registered representatives facilitated more than 2,000 trades with such flippers, allowing the firm to obtain bonds for its own inventory and improperly obtain a higher priority in the bond allocation process, according to the SEC.
The regulator also settled proceedings with UBS registered representatives William S. Costas and John J. Marvin, finding that they had ""negligently"" submitted retail orders for bonds on behalf of flipper customers. Costas also helped UBS traders improperly obtain bonds for the firm's own inventory through the flippers, the SEC said.
Costas agreed to pay disgorgement and interest totaling $16,585 and a civil penalty of $25,000. Marvin agreed to pay disgorgement and interest of $27,966 and a civil penalty of $25,000, the SEC said.
""Retail order periods are intended to prioritize retail investors' access to municipal bonds and we will continue to pursue violations that undermine this priority,"" said LeeAnn G. Gaunt, chief of the SEC Division of Enforcement’s Public Finance Abuse Unit.

UBS and the two representatives did not admit or deny the agency's findings, the SEC said. A spokeswoman for the firm said UBS had fully cooperated with the agency and was pleased to resolve the matter.

The government would ask ministries to keep requests for other spending in line with the current fiscal year's initial budget totalling a record high of 102.7 trillion yen, Finance Minister Taro Aso said at a cabinet meeting.
It would then set aside an unspecified amount of budget requests to respond to ""urgently needed expenses"" to battle the fallout from the coronavirus.
Japan's fiscal year runs through April to next March.
The budget ceiling is usually set around mid-year by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to keep a tab on spending requests from ministries for next year's budget to be compiled in December.
""Response to the novel coronavirus remains as urgent task,"" Aso was quoted as telling a cabinet meeting. ""On the other hand, there's a limit to foresee how to respond with budget spending.""
The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on the world's third-largest economy, which is in the grip of its worst postwar recession. 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government has rolled out a combined stimulus spending worth $2.2 trillion, which has boosted the size of annual budget spending to 160 trillion yen with new debt issuance totalling 90 trillion yen.
The virus stimulus spending came on top of bulging welfare costs to support the ageing society, which Aso said would be taken into consideration during budget compilation by the year end.

The finance ministry will examine the requests and finalise the size of spending in December when it drafts next year's budget. The deadline for budget requests was delayed by one month to end-September due to uncertainty caused by the coronavirus.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Advisers to President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats were set to discuss the next steps in responding to the coronavirus crisis on Tuesday, with congressional Republicans saying they were working on a $1 trillion relief bill.
In a meeting on Monday at the White House, Republican lawmakers and administration officials said they were making progress toward fresh legislation aimed at cushioning the heavy economic toll of the pandemic.
""Senate Republicans will put forward our proposal soon, I hope our Democratic colleagues will be ready to work together,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who hopes to unveil the proposal this week.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will host a meeting on Tuesday to discuss coronavirus relief with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, a source familiar with the matter said.
Administration officials also met with Republican senators at the Capitol on Monday. They said the meeting had gone well and they planned more discussions on Tuesday. 
They offered few details, with Mnuchin commenting only that a reporter's suggestion that there would be more than $70 billion for schools was ""a good guess.""
The Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic-led House of Representatives have less than two weeks to hammer out a new relief package before enhanced unemployment benefits run out for tens of millions of American workers made jobless by the COVID-19 pandemic.
House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said the Republican proposal would include a cut to the payroll tax on workers' gross earnings, which funds national retirement programs. Trump backs such a cut as an economic stimulus, but the idea has stirred little enthusiasm among lawmakers, who worry about protecting Social Security payments.
""We're working and negotiating with the Democrats and trying to get a plan that helps small business, helps people, helps this country,"" Trump said.
Mnuchin did not provide details about the bill beyond saying that it included the payroll tax cut. ""It's in the bill, so we'll see,"" he told reporters.
Schumer warned that Democrats were prepared to stymie any Republican effort to pass partisan legislation. ""A bipartisan, bicameral process will result in a much better bill for the American people,"" he said in a letter to colleagues.

Congress has so far committed $3 trillion to the crisis. In the more than 12 weeks since Trump signed the last bill into law, the number of U.S. coronavirus cases has more than tripled to over 3.7 million. The virus has killed over 140,000 people in the United States. Both figures lead the world.
""We are nowhere near out of the woods,"" McConnell said.
Mnuchin, who led previous coronavirus bill negotiations with Congress, said he intended to ""focus on starting with another trillion dollars. We think that will have a big impact.""
But Democrats have pledged to fight for legislation akin to a $3 trillion bill the House approved in mid-May, providing hundreds of billions of dollars for state and local governments, extending enhanced unemployment insurance and providing new payments to individuals and families. 
The prospect for legislation was upstaged over the weekend by reports of White House plans to eliminate funding for testing, drawing opposition from Republicans as well as Democrats.

""I'm for whatever it takes to get enough tests out there to safely open up schools and other aspects of our economy,"" Senator John Thune, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, told reporters.

""There is typically less activity in both the primary and secondary markets during summertime. That’s one reason why the monthly volume of purchases may drop,"" Schnabel told Spanish newspaper Expansión in an interview.
Schnabel added that the ECB was likely to use its entire bond purchase quota, seemingly backtracking on earlier comments that an emergency bond purchase scheme could be ended before it was fully utilized.
Although Schnabel and board member Yves Mersch both raised the prospect of an early end, ECB President Lagarde last week said this was unlikely, a comment Schnabel appeared to echo this time.
""As long as we remain in the baseline scenario of our projections, it’s likely that the (bond purchase) envelope will be used in full,"" she said.
The ECB left policy unchanged last week, capping months of extraordinary easing as the 19-country euro zone's economy started to slowly rebound as pandemic-related restrictions were gradually lifted.
Although the ECB has already agreed to buy 1.8 trillion euros ($2.06 trillion) worth of debt through next June and gave banks over 1.3 trillion euros worth of loans at deeply negative rates, economist still expect the bank to provide further stimulus as the recovery could prove protracted. 

But Schnabel said the ECB would not let markets dictate policy and further stimulus could come only if real economic indicators indicated a need.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders appeared to be nearing agreement on a massive stimulus plan for their coronavirus-blighted economies on Monday despite lingering tensions between them after four days of summit squabbling.
EU Council President Charles Michel said he would present the 27 leaders with a new proposal and was confident it could be the basis for a deal that many say is critical to dispel doubts about the bloc's very future.
""I know that the last steps are always the most difficult but I am confident ... and I am convinced that an agreement is possible,"" he told reporters before heading back to the leaders.
Slow to coordinate their initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic and already weakened by Britain's departure from the bloc, a deal on the economic aid plan would demonstrate that the Europeans can step up to a crisis and remain united.
""It has been a long summit and a challenging summit but the prize is worth negotiating for,"" Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said as the Brussels summit dragged into its fourth day - approaching the record length set at a 2000 meeting in the French city of Nice.
Diplomats said it was far from certain that the leaders could put aside the rancour that stood in the way of a compromise over hours of haggling through the weekend, and one said negotiations could run deep into Monday night.
Indeed, a session of all 27 leaders scheduled for Monday afternoon was delayed by two hours to 6:00 p.m. (1600 GMT) and still hadn't started as of 7:30 p.m.
Emotions ran high at a dinner on Sunday as a group of fiscally frugal northern nations led by the Netherlands stood their ground on the level of free grants within a proposed special recovery fund of 750 billion euros overall.
""STINGY EGOTISTS""
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki railed against the 'frugals' on Monday, branding them ""a group of stingy, egotistic states that look at things very narrowly through the prism of their own interests"".
Poland would be a top beneficiary of the recovery package, receiving tens of billions of euros in grants and cheap loans, along with high-debt Mediterranean-rim countries that have taken the brunt of the pandemic in Europe.
Despite the continued rhetorical skirmishing, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the leaders now had a new basis for a deal on the stimulus package and, linked to it, the EU's 2021-2027 common budget of around 1.1 trillion euros.
French President Emmanuel Macron lost patience in the early hours of Monday, however, and banged his fist on the table in frustration at ""sterile blockages"" by the 'frugals', two diplomats said.
But by daylight, he shared Merkel's optimism, telling reporters: ""I'm starting today with a lot of determination to make progress."" 
Hopes for a deal to help address Europe's deepest recession since World War Two sent Italy's borrowing costs to their lowest since early March and pushed the euro to a 19-week high.
Diplomats said that within the 750 billion euro recovery fund, the leaders may agree on 390 billion as non-repayable grants, down from the 500 billion originally proposed.
Issues over tying payouts to economic reforms were still to be resolved, though diplomats said this would follow smoothly once there was a compromise on the balance between grants and repayable loans in the fund.
There were also differences over a rule-of-law mechanism proposed by liberal western states aimed at freezing funding to countries that flout democratic principles. Hungary, backed by eurosceptic ally Poland, has threatened to veto the package if fund disbursement is made conditional on upholding democracy.

European Council President Charles Michel distributed the latest plan on Monday, which would include 390 billion euros of grants, down from an initial 500 billion euros, and 360 billion euros of low-interest loans, according to a copy of the proposal seen by Bloomberg.
The new plan seeks to break an impasse between fiscal conservatives in northern Europe and a majority who want decisive action to help the southern nations hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic. If they can reach a deal, it would mark an unprecedented deepening of financial integration for the bloc.
A handful of fiscal hawks led by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte have been pushing to reduce the total size of the stimulus package and to impose strict constraints on how it can be used.
While officials from all sides have suggested the new volume of grants would be acceptable, it’s unclear whether other aspects of the the latest compromise would be met with consensus, including on issues to do with climate and the rule of law.
Leaders have been warning that an accord is far from a given, though they have been sounding cautiously optimistic over the past few hours. All 27 member states need to agree before the plan can move forward.

LONDON (Reuters) - Some of the world's biggest insurers are wrong to deny a payout to hundreds of thousands of small British businesses, battered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the London High Court was told on Monday.
Britain's markets watchdog has taken eight insurers, including  Hiscox  (L:HSX), RSA (L:RSA), QBE (AX:QBE) and Zurich (S:ZURN), to court. 
The businesses, from restaurants to leisure groups, said they faced ruin after insurers rejected their attempts to claim millions of pounds collectively in compensation for lost business.
Colin Edelman, a lawyer representing the Financial Conduct Authority, told the court on the first day of an eight-day hearing that the 17 policy wordings under scrutiny in the case were similar to wordings used by more than 60 insurers in total. Around 370,000 policyholders could be affected, he said.
The FCA says the pandemic should trigger payments under the policies, which provide cover when insured premises cannot be used because of restrictions imposed by a public authority and in the event of a notifiable disease.
The insurers say the policies covered local incidents, rather than a pandemic and national lockdown. 
""They're not to be protected from the fact that a cataclysmic event has happened. That's just bad luck being an insurer,"" Edelman said. 
The FCA, which is concerned customers should be treated fairly, said in its skeleton argument published last week that the policyholders in the case were ""generally not sophisticated or well-resourced insurance buyers"".

The hearing is due to conclude on July 30.

Trump, a Republican, mentioned New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore and Oakland, California, as possible places for sending in federal forces, noting the cities' mayors are ""liberal Democrats."" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot frequently blasts Trump on Twitter.

122,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Russia's Sberbank may be able to write off $2 billion state loan - sources,"By Tatiana Voronova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Sberbank (MM:SBER) may be allowed to write off 150 billion roubles ($2 billion) in a subordinated loan from the central bank as part of the state's support for its biggest bank during the COVID-19 crisis.
Three sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the finance ministry had agreed that the loan, which was agreed a decade ago, could be upgraded to boost Sberbank's capital and may be even written off. 
The sources include a banker close to Sberbank's supervisory board, a person close to the government and another source close to all sides involved in the discussions - the central bank, the finance ministry and Sberbank itself. 
In a statement to Reuters, Sberbank confirmed 150 billion roubles could be included in Tier 1 capital and could be written off under certain conditions. 
Sberbank, which is being used to deliver state cash to help individuals and businesses survive the impact of the pandemic, has not received direct financial support but, in common with its peers, has enjoyed a temporary relaxation of some supervision rules. 
The upgrade would increase Sberbank's flexibility to absorb potential losses after a more than two-month-long, country-wide lockdown left many Russians and companies with reduced revenues or none at all, the sources said. 
In April, the finance ministry bought a 50% stake in Sberbank from the central bank, meaning it has the right to claim back 150 billion roubles, which was part of a bigger subordinated loan the central bank has provided for Sberbank in the 2008-09 financial crisis.
Under the scheme, the loan is to be moved from the less secure Tier 2 to Sberbank's Tier 1 capital, a security net essential to allowing the bank to absorb bad loans and continue lending. 
Provided the government and the central bank have no objections, Sberbank may even write the loan off, the sources said, replacing any potential need for a direct state cash injection to support the bank. Otherwise, the loan will mature after 2060. 

The central bank declined to comment and the finance ministry did not reply to a Reuters request for a comment.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine's new central bank governor promised on Monday to maintain the independence of the central bank and cooperation with the International Monetary Fund while continuing to cut interest rates.
Governor Kyrylo Shevchenko's words may have been intended to reassure the market after the turbulent exit of his predecessor rattled investors and prompted the government to postpone a Eurobond sale. 
He was installed last week after his predecessor, Yakiv Smoliy, quit, citing political pressure. It came a month after Ukraine had secured a new $5 billion IMF deal, contingent on the central bank remaining independent. 
""The National Bank will remain an independent institution. Decisions will continue to be made professionally and economically,"" Shevchenko said, speaking alongside President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. 
""The NBU (National Bank of Ukraine) should continue the policy of lowering the discount rate, which, as a result, will lead to cheaper loans for the final borrower,"" he added. 
Zelenskiy also said the central bank should remain ""a pillar of macroeconomic stability,"" adding: 
""It is difficult to calculate how many times the thesis that the head of the NBU should be independent was voiced and I, as the president of Ukraine, fully support this.""
Smoliy resigned at the start of July, complaining the central bank was being pressured to take bad decisions and that its officials were being harassed. Zelenskiy's government has consistently denied trying to exert undue influence over him. 
Smoliy had brought interest rates down to their lowest level since independence in 1991, to 6%, but was criticised for not lowering them more quickly. The first rate-setting meeting under Shevchenko's leadership is due on Thursday. 
Shevchenko, 47, born in Russia, a career banker who worked briefly in a mine, had been tipped by local media to become the next governor since February. 

In the past, Shevchenko has criticised monetary policy under Smoliy for being too hawkish, allowing the currency to appreciate and push up import costs.

The officials were responding to a court case mounted by five trade unions which are trying to force the government to pay wage increases that were due to come into force in April as part of a three-year deal struck in 2018.
The government kept wages flat in April, the first month of the new fiscal year, citing economic pressures. According to the 2018 agreement, the government was due to pay a minimum of projected consumer inflation of 4.4%.
Public sector wages are a closely watched expenditure item for ratings agencies concerned about the country's rising debt trajectory.
In an affidavit filed in the Labour Court on Friday, National Treasury Director-General Dondo Mogajane said paying the inflation-linked increases would plunge the government into additional debt of 37.8 billion rand ($2.26 billion).
The unions have argued that since the increases have been incorporated into their members' employment contracts, they are entitled to them.
""Since public servants have been the beneficiaries of decades' above-inflation salary increases outperforming private sector salaries, this (paying further increases) is not just and equitable. Least of all in circumstances where government is now compelled by the COVID-19 circumstances to expend additional funds to protect vulnerable people,"" Mogajane said.
""This is not in solidarity with other workers in the rest of the country,"" he added.
Senzo Mchunu, minister of public service and administration, said in a separate affidavit that the government faced ""too many competing interests on our contracted resources"".
Mchunu said his ministry was exploring the possibility of a ""one-off non-pensionable payment"" instead of the wage increases, without disclosing the size of the potential payment.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - While a resurgence in coronavirus cases in Texas has brought many businesses to a screeching halt, eight robots have kept All Axis Machining's metal fabrication facility in Dallas humming.
The small, nimble robots perform multiple jobs, such as machine-tending, sanding, deburring, part inspection and laser marking, leaving owner Gary Kuzmin far less dependent on manual labor. When all the workers on one shift went into self-quarantine last month, it had no impact on the facility's productivity.
All Kuzmin had to do was to move a couple of workers from other shifts to supervise the robots. ""I have not lost any spindle time because of the pandemic,"" he said.
Companies of all sizes are leaning on automation to keep factories running without compromising the health and safety of their workers. Half of the chief financial officers surveyed last month by PricewaterhouseCoopers said they were planning to accelerate automation.
With the U.S. economy grappling with a double-digit unemployment rate, however, industry's rush to robots will fuel worries about semi-skilled or unskilled workers as low-paid, routine tasks become more likely to be automated.
""It is the most productive thing for us to have the robots,"" said Kuzmin. ""I don't even look at a machine these days without thinking how I would automate it.""
Since August 2018, when All Axis Machining began using robots, its productivity has doubled with the same headcount. If not for the robots, the company would have needed to expand its staff of 30 by 50% to keep up with increase in demand.
""We are less dependent upon a semi-skilled employee,"" said Kuzmin. 
The pandemic has changed companies' calculations about investments in automation, said Jeremie Capron, research chief at research and investment-advisory firm ROBO Global. ""The cost of operating without a robot today in a factory is higher than it was pre-COVID,"" he said.
Mark Muro, senior fellow and policy director at Washington-based the Brookings Institution, says the automation drive will result in a net reduction in the workforce as companies invest in technology not just for social distancing, but also to boost productivity and protect profits from the pandemic-induced recession. 
""Technology has improved and gotten cheaper, and the financial pressure on companies is higher,"" he said.
He noted, however, that since middle class and lower-paid workers tend to spend a larger share of their income than the higher-paid, it is important that productivity gains eventually result in more jobs.
""If there is... too little sharing of the gains of automation-supported growth, we will wind up with little economic activity,"" Muro said. 
LOWER COST, FASTER PAYBACK
The affordable cost of the so-called collaborative robots, or ""cobots,"" promises payback in months, making the changeover easier, even for small and medium-sized enterprises. 
All Axis Machining, for example, spent $85,000 per robot and was able to recover the cost in five months. There are cheaper collaborative robots on the market, as well.
One of the most popular cobots sold by Denmark-based Universal Robots - a unit of Massachusetts-based  Teradyne Inc . (O:TER) and a market leader in collaborative robotics technology - costs about $35,000, with a payback period of three to four months.
The robots are very easy to use, safe to be around and can easily be adapted to new tasks. It takes just hours to train employees to work with them, saving companies huge training expense.
Although they are not suited for heavy-duty jobs, they are designed to work alongside humans, making them the robots of choice in the age of social distancing.
California-based DCL Logistics, a third-party logistics company, decided to employ cobots to manage a 30% increase in orders in the immediate aftermath of the outbreak.
Normally, the company would have hired temporary workers to deal with the surge in orders. But bringing in new workers was fraught with safety risks, said Chief Revenue Officer Brian Tu. The robots have led to a 300% increase in productivity and a 60% jump in labor cost savings, Tu said.
DCL plans to deploy more cobots this year at its facilities in California and Kentucky.
At All Axis Machining, the cobots have allowed owner Kuzmin to stagger the shifts. The facility now runs three shifts seven days a week, with robots working the late night shift alone, without any roving inspector.
This has allowed workers in the facility to stay 30 feet apart from each other. Having seen the benefits, the company is automating its remaining machines as well.
Kuzmin, who also runs a robotics services company, says several Dallas-based manufacturers have approached him recently to install similar robots in their factories.
ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY
Universal Robots is fielding inquiries from companies seeking social distancing solutions, as well as tools to re-shore production and make their operations more flexible.
""Some companies... are talking about dozens and dozens of robots,"" said Joe Campbell, senior manager of applications development at Universal Robots.
Still, the virus-induced recession is keeping many companies on the sidelines, wary of making new investments.
Tacoma, Washington-based Tool Gauge, which makes metal and plastic parts and assemblies for aerospace companies, including  Boeing Co . (N:BA), planned to add two mobile industrial robots to its fleet of two cobots and 10 industrial robots before the novel coronavirus hammered the aviation industry.

But Tool Gauge put the robots on hold after a production shutdown at Boeing's Washington state factories and an overall drop in orders, General Manager Jim Lee said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's central bank is expected to cut its benchmark interest rate to a fresh record low on Friday, as a lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus and still-low oil prices cause the economy to shrink. 
Sixteen analysts and economists in a Reuters poll of 29 experts said they believed the central bank would cut its key rate to 4.25% .
Expectations for a rate cut, cemented by the economic crisis and subdued risks of higher inflation, were boosted last week by central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina, who said she felt there was room for lower rates in Russia.
""We consider her words to be a verbal intervention that is preparing the market for a 25 basis points rate cut on July 24,"" Alfa Bank said.
Central bank deputy governor Alexei Zabotkin told Reuters the bank will consider a rate cut on July 24 even though it has already used up much of its room to ease policy.
A 25 basis point cut is what ""the money market is expecting from the CBR and thus such a decision is safer in terms of suggesting a more predictable market response,"" VTB Capital said.
Lower rates make lending cheaper and may lessen the economic contraction after the coronavirus pandemic, which has battered business and consumer activity. A partial lockdown across Russia has capped the risk of inflation substantially overshooting the central bank's 4% target.
Eleven experts in the poll expected the central bank to slash the key rate by 50 basis points. Two analysts predicted an on-hold decision. 
""All in all, it seems that the easing cycle is close to its end in Russia,"" Nordea Bank said.
The central bank, which shifted to an accommodative monetary policy stance earlier this year, will also revise the range of interest rates it considers ""neutral"" from the previous 6-7%, Zabotkin said.
Despite the lowering of borrowing costs, Russian OFZ government bonds, popular among foreign investors, remain attractive compared to their peers.

Friday's rate decision is due at 1030 GMT and will be followed by an online media conference with Nabiullina, who is expected to shed more light on the monetary policy outlook and present new economic forecasts.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big banks are making a lot less money from their deposits than they did before the coronavirus pandemic.
Net interest income, the difference between what banks pay for money and what they receive lending it out, fell by $5 billion, or 10%, at the four biggest U.S. banks in the second quarter from a year earlier. 
The plunge came after the Federal Reserve pushed down overnight interest rates in March to near zero to support the economy's struggle against the coronavirus pandemic.
With rates down on loans and securities, the banks earned less investing their deposits. JPMorgan Chase & Co, (N:JPM) for example, reported that its net interest spread from consumer deposits fell to 1.52% in the second quarter, from 2.60% a year earlier when the Fed benchmark was 2.25%.
Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), which boasts the most consumer deposits of U.S. banks, said profits from consumer deposits fell to $785 million from $2.2 billion a year earlier.
""Those deposits aren't as valuable in a lower-rate environment,"" Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio told analysts. ""You're now seeing us getting hurt.""
After the COVID-19 outbreak, banks were flooded with new deposits. But they were reluctant to invest the money for fear individuals and businesses would quickly take it back. Bank of America said it put the money into cash and cash-like accounts earning a bare 0.1%.
""The place we're uncertain is the large cash inflows from corporate customers,"" Bank of America's chief executive, Brian Moynihan, told analysts.
Once bank executives have a better sense of the path of the pandemic and whether deposits will stay, they will shift some into higher-yielding securities, Donofrio said.

Bank analyst David Hendler of Viola Risk Advisors said loan growth isn't much of an option given weak demand and credit risks. ""Their margins are squeezed and they don't have many levers to pull,"" he said.

Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, July 20th.
1. Fights over the next round of stimulus 
The week starts with two economic stimulus packages in focus. Congressional Republicans are due to meet with President Donald Trump to discuss the terms of what would be the fifth U.S. stimulus package, 11 days before a raft of earlier measures are due to expire.
“The economy is probably not ready for the abrupt withdrawal of money that that implies,” Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a morning briefing.  
Meanwhile in Europe, an EU summit that aimed to approve the 750 billion euro ($860 billion) recovery fund has dragged on to a fourth day, amid resistance from five northern European states to the idea of 500 billion euros in grants to poorer countries. Reports suggest the proportion of grants could be whittled down to as little as 390 billion euros, leaving a greater part to be made up by conditional loans that would take longer to approve and disburse. Talks are set to resume at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT)
The euro still rose 0.3% to $1.1454 by 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), close to a four-month high.
2. AstraZeneca/Oxford University to update on drug progress
AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) is due to release the results of clinical trials for its experimental Covid-19 drug, being developed in partnership with Oxford University in England.
AZ’s drug was touted by Business Week last week as being the front-runner of all the various candidate vaccines being developed by the world’s pharma industry. Early-stage test results had suggested that the drug killed not only the virus, but also the cells infected by it, strengthening the body’s immune response.  
Elsewhere, Dutch medical technology company Philips stock rose 4.8% to its highest since January after posting a surge in sales of and orders for its ventilators, while a U.K. small-cap Synairgen more than tripled after reporting positive early-stage results for a protein-based Covid treatment.  
3. Stocks set to open lower;  IBM  's, Halliburton's earnings eyed
U.S. stock markets are poised to open mostly lower against the backdrop of more negative headlines over the weekend about the spread of the coronavirus. Florida posted its fifth straight day of over 10,000 new cases on Sunday, while the mayor of Los Angeles said that the city was ""on the brink"" of imposing fresh restrictions to try to slow down the virus' spread. 
President Trump, meanwhile, told Fox News that the country is dealing with the 'dying embers' of the epidemic, although he acknowledged that Florida was still 'a flame'.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 55 points or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was essentially unchanged. 
Earnings season continues with updates from oil and gas services company Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) before the opening, and with International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) after the closing bell.
4.  Disney joins Facebook boycott (sort of)
Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) has – sort of – joined the advertising boycott of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) over its perceived failure to tackle hate speech on its social media platforms, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Disney, which was Facebook’s biggest advertiser in the first half of the year with a total ad spend of some $210 million, hasn’t made any public decision about its advertising policy, but the number of ads for its new streaming service Disney+ on Facebook’s main platform has nearly dried up, the WSJ said.
In addition, the company has also paused advertising for its Hulu service on Facebook’s Instagram platform.
5. Oil weakens on Chinese news; Chevron goes bargain-hunting
Crude oil prices started the week on a weak note on reports that Chinese refiners will reduce throughput in response to a drop in local demand due to heavy flooding.  
U.S. crude futures fell 0.9% to $40.41 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent was down 0.8% at $42.78 a barrel.
The pressure of low prices was also evident as Noble Energy (NASDAQ:NBL), whose shares have more than halved this year, agreed to be bought by Chevron (NYSE:CVX) for just under $5 billion in an all-stock deal. Chevron stock was down 1.3% in premarket trade, while Noble (NYSE:NE)'s was up 9.9%.
Elsewhere, reports said that Saudi Arabia’s King Salman and the Emir of Kuwait were both hospitalized.

132,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>",Investment consultants who advise on trillions scored taxpayer loans,"By Lawrence Delevingne
BOSTON (Reuters) - R.V. Kuhns & Associates Inc, an investment consulting firm that advises on $2.5 trillion in retirement plans and other assets, sent a message of confidence in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing this spring, as COVID-19 wreaked destruction across America's economy. The firm, it said, stood ready to ""to maintain all the services we provide.""
The Portland, Oregon-based company, known as RVK, disclosed in the filing that it had been helped by some extra cash: a forgivable loan of between $2 million and $5 million from the Small Business Administration's pandemic relief fund. 
It was not alone in the world of big-money consultancy. RVK is one of at least 40 consultants to retirement plans and other institutional investors that were approved for loans totaling as much as $37 million to support staffing levels and pay rent, according to a Reuters review of government data released this month. It wasn't always clear why the consultants found it necessary to apply, given incomes that are typically steady and based on client fees from long-term contracts to design portfolios or provide administrative services.
Graphic: Paycheck Protection Program - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/PPP/xlbvgodxbvq/
RVK's president, James Voytko, told Reuters his firm took the government assistance because its nearly 200 clients – which include major public pension plans and charitable endowments – were ""under significant financial pressure"" and sought increased support from the firm, whose staff has worked unusually long hours. 
The loan to RVK was meant to protect 119 jobs at the firm, according to the government data. Voytko said in an e-mail that RVK had followed program guidelines and maintained staffing levels, though he declined to answer written questions about the extent to which the coronavirus pandemic had impacted the company's finances.
He confirmed that almost all of RVK's revenue comes from fixed annual retainer fees. But, he said, ""while the assets under advisement are large, our firm is not compensated via an asset based fee."" And, he added, ""we do not have a well financed parent with access to operating capital from many sources.""
Kyle Herrig, president of Washington, D.C.-based government watchdog group Accountable.US, told Reuters that investment consultants taking the taxpayer-funded loans was an ""egregious"" example of how the program had too often benefited relatively healthy companies, especially during its quickly-depleted first funding round.
The Small Business Administration and Treasury Department did not respond to an email seeking comment about the loans from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which they jointly administered.

Another large consulting firm, Meketa Investment Group Inc, told Reuters that taking a PPP loan, listed as between $2 million and $5 million, was a ""prudent"" step to protect employees and maintain high-level service to clients. 
""We believe this and other preemptive steps are the responsible actions of fiduciaries,"" given likely future impacts of COVID-19, the firm said in a statement. 
Meketa, based near Boston with $1.5 trillion of assets under advisement as of March 31, said in a regulatory filing this June that ""we do not believe that we would have been unable to meet any contractual commitment absent our receipt of the loan. However, we believe that the loan was necessary to support our existing operations, including allowing us to maintain full staffing."" 
The company's clients include major state pension plans such as the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the New York City Employees’ Retirement System, according to public disclosures. 
Another company, LeafHouse Financial Group LLC in Austin, Texas, which consulted on $9.6 billion as of December 31, took up to $350,000 in PPP funds in mid-April to protect its 19 staff amid business uncertainty and protections for lost revenue, according to a spokeswoman, Kassandra Hendrix. 
Hendrix said LeafHouse had received word from its mostly small business and non-profit clients that they were getting squeezed by a variety of factors, including a plummeting stock market and lower retirement contribution rates. 
""We applied for the loan to prepare us to weather this temporary storm and maintain all staffing levels while striving to provide our clients with the best possible service when it is needed most,"" she wrote. LeafHouse, she said, typically collects fees of less than 0.05% on assets it advises on. 
Other large investment consultants approved for up to $1 million each in PPP loans include Advanced Capital Group Inc, which advises on $23 billion; Pensionmark Financial Group LLC, which advises on $14.7 billion; and Newport Capital Group, which advises on more than $13 billion, according to government data and regulatory filings as of December 31. 
Those firms did not respond to e-mails seeking comment. The government data set included only loans that were approved, and did not say which of them were actually disbursed or if they had been returned or forgiven.

Overall, the PPP loans protected about 51 million American jobs, the Trump administration said on July 6 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-ppp/u-s-pandemic-aid-program-saved-51-1-million-jobs-but-wealthy-and-connected-also-benefited-idUSKBN2471ZD, as it revealed how $521.4 billion in taxpayer cash was injected into small businesses. But problems in the data have cast doubt on the projection of how many jobs were saved, Reuters has reported https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-ppp-jobs/trump-administration-says-pandemic-aid-saved-51-million-jobs-did-it-idUSKBN24901U.

134,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>","Factbox: Trump, Biden offer clashing visions on reopening economy","By Trevor Hunnicutt and Jason Lange
(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic threw tens of millions of Americans out of work, ended the longest U.S. economic recovery on record and undermined a key argument for President Donald Trump's re-election.
Now, the Republican president and his Democratic opponent in the Nov. 3 election, Joe Biden, have to convince Americans who can get the economy back on track.
As part of his broader economic plan, Biden is expected to propose new policies as soon as this week to increase jobs in childcare, elder care and education.
Here is how the candidates want to revive the economy:
BACK ON TRACK
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, Trump has signed legislation to flush the economy with trillions of dollars in onetime aid to businesses, individuals and local governments.
The president also pushed states to reopen as quickly as possible, even as infections spiked.
Biden has cautioned against reopening the economy without first ramping up coronavirus testing. The former vice president, who oversaw U.S. stimulus spending after the 2008 financial crisis, says households - as well as local governments - need more support to get through the shutdown.
While Trump has said further stimulus measures must include a payroll tax cut, Biden wants Washington to offer states more support in paying for unemployment benefits.
TAXES AND WAGES
The president, a former real estate developer, has touted the 2017 tax cuts he signed into law as stimulating economic growth. Cutting payroll taxes would boost paychecks of most working Americans.
Biden criticized the 2017 tax cuts as giving too many benefits to the wealthy and corporations. He has pledged to reverse some of those cuts, raising the marginal tax rate on the highest income earners back to 39.6%, from 37%, while also lifting investment profit taxes. He also supports raising the national minimum wage to $15 an hour from $7.25 and expanding some tax credits for lower-income workers.
""We have to build a much more inclusive, much more equitable middle class and an economy that everybody - everybody - gets a fair shot at,"" Biden said in April.
The Trump campaign is attacking the policy of raising taxes while the economy struggles to recover.
TRADE
In a return to a core issue of his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump is telling voters he wants to boost domestic manufacturing. He stepped up verbal attacks on Beijing as his administration accelerates an initiative to remove industrial supply chains from China.
He has also argued that America's difficulties in procuring medical supplies internationally during the pandemic are another reason to encourage U.S. companies to avoid offshoring.
""If one thing comes out of this, more than anything else, is that we should make product in the United States,"" Trump said in April.
Biden offered his own made-in-American manufacturing plan in July. He pledged to spend $700 billion on American-made products and industrial research, which he said would give at least 5 million more people a paycheck during a job-killing pandemic.
As a senator, Biden voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a trade pact that helped Mexican factories gain access to the U.S. market.
Biden has criticized Trump's tariff war with China as bad for U.S. consumers and farmers. In 2018, he called for ""retaliation"" on countries like China which he has said subsidize industries and allow intellectual property theft.
GREEN INVESTMENTS
Biden said he would spend $2 trillion over four years to improve infrastructure, create zero-emissions public transportation, build sustainable homes and create clean-energy jobs.

Trump advocates more spending on U.S. roads, bridges and airports, too, but has signaled little appetite for making ""green"" investments.

135,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 04:55AM ET</span>",Australia faces avalanche of business failures in September 'fiscal cliff',"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia faces an avalanche of business failures in its transport and hospitality sectors after government subsidies end in September, insolvency lawyers and economists say, while some argue that so-called 'zombie' firms should be allowed to fail.
About 240,000 businesses in tourism and professional services are at high risk of failing during the September 'fiscal cliff', when widespread wage subsidies are set to end, economists at Deloitte said on Monday.
Despite the pain, it has never been more important to let otherwise 'zombie' companies with endemic operational flaws fail, so as to allow capital to flow to productive firms critical to the recovery of the economy, they say.
""Money that is just floating around in businesses that aren't really providing an effective output to the economy is problematic,"" said John Winter, the chairman of the Australian Restructuring Insolvency & Turnaround Association.
""The challenge with those businesses that should have gone broke in this period, but haven't because of the government's stimulus, is that they are still racking up debts, and those debts are to somebody else.
""It could be the bank, it could be their landlord, but it could also be other businesses, their suppliers, so it's not a victimless crime when you let zombie companies trade while insolvent.""
In March, complementing a A$160-billion stimulus package, Australia scrapped strict insolvent trading obligations on businesses and lengthened creditors' notice period to act on debts, letting many firms keep trading without paying rent, tax and loans.
Banks alone have about 220,000 business loans worth over A$60 billion on loan repayment holidays and as the clock ticks down to September, analysts say the risks of foreclosures ""en masse"" are rising.
""We believe this is likely to weigh heavily on small businesses which employ 35% of the workforce,"" UBS told clients in a note.
""As wage subsidies, rental relief and loan deferrals come to an end, this could lead to a second wave of unemployment.""
About 40% of businesses across hospitality, professional services, and transport say they only have cash for less than three months of operations, Deloitte's report found.
""I think it is going to be profoundly challenging,"" said Maria O'Brien, the head of Baker McKenzie's restructuring and insolvency practice in Australia.
""I do anticipate that there will be really substantial numbers of insolvent enterprises, because revenues are not coming back - they would not come back immediately and they may not come back ever in a whole range of sectors.""
But while further fiscal stimulus is expected, some businesses should accept voluntary administration, some argued.
This bankruptcy process is akin to Chapter 11 in allowing moratoriums against certain creditor claims, which might offer the best way to help businesses survive.
""When used appropriately, administration can be an efficient and cost effective restructuring tool,"" said Deloitte Access Economics' partner Kristian Kolding.
""Society also needs to overcome the historical stigma associated with external administration.""

Ncube, said he would not seek additional funding this year since the national treasury had spent less than half of its budget despite pressure from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""I am still focusing on a budget deficit of 1.5% of GDP and we are well on our way to achieving that,"" Ncube said during a review of the half-year budget held virtually. This would be an improvement on last year's 4% deficit. 
It was not clear why that figure was omitted from last week's presentation.
Economic analysts are worried that President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government is trying to balance the budget at the expense of spending more on social services and the health sector, even as it grapples with the coronavirus pandemic.
Zimbabwe is in the grip of its worst economic crisis in more than a decade that has seen a sharp devaluation of its currency and inflation running above 700%, one of the highest in the world.
The government has spooked investors by temporarily shutting the stock exchange saying it was being used to sabotage the economy. 
Ncube said the local bourse would only be re-opened once investigations into its activities are concluded in two weeks and the government receives recommendations.

He added that a planned U.S. dollar stock exchange in the resort town of Victoria Falls was set to open next month after parliament enacts a law for its establishment.

The central bank, which has cut rates three times to almost zero this year and launched large-scale bond purchases to help the economy overcome the coronavirus crisis, said in its inflation projection last week that it expected CPI to fall to 1.5% in 2021 from 3.3% seen this year.
""I have doubts over the forecast inflation path. In my opinion there is a risk that inflation will be higher,"" Hardt said in an interview with the Parkiet daily.
Asked whether the central bank should increase its benchmark rate from the current 0.1%, Hardt said that was worth considering, especially when inflation remains high.
""Then, the reference rate could rise, but at the same time the rediscount rate could remain unchanged and we could potentially launch a Polish TLTRO (targeted-longer term refinancing operations) at a rate lower than the reference one,"" said Hardt, one of the few hawks on the rate-setting panel.
Inflation in June was 3.3%, above forecasts, driven by ""core"" prices - excluding the food and energy sectors - which accelerated after the easing of the coronavirus lockdown.
Hardt also said the central bank could launch a bigger bond-purchasing plan if the benchmark rate was higher.

Last month, Tengku Zafrul said even compensation of $3 billion would be unacceptable, and that Malaysia would pursue its legal case against Goldman Sachs until an acceptable settlement was offered.
Three units of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) have pleaded not guilty in Malaysia to misleading investors over bond sales totalling $6.5 billion that the bank helped raise for 1MDB.
Public outrage over the billions of dollars lost at 1MDB played a part in the defeat of then prime minister Najib Razak in a 2018 election. Najib's United Malays National Organisation returned to power in March as a partner in a new coalition government led by Prime Minister Yassin Muhyiddin.
Confirming the arrival in Malaysia of the Goldman negotiating team in a statement on Monday, Tengku Zafrul expressed hope that the talks would ""enable us to move closer towards achieving the desired results on the recovery of 1MDB assets."" 
A source close to the government said Malaysia's attorney-general, Idrus Harun, will lead the Malaysian team in talks with Goldman Sachs' executives.
The source said it was unclear if a settlement would be reached, as ""it depends on what GS is bringing to the table"".
The Malaysian attorney-general's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Edward Naylor, Goldman Sachs's Asia head of corporate communications, declined to comment ""at this stage"".
On Sunday, Singapore daily The Straits Times reported that a six-member team of Goldman Sachs top executives and legal advisors had entered Malaysia on July 18, on a special permit from the Malaysian government, to resume negotiations on the settlement deal.

Malaysia had imposed a ban on foreign arrivals since March as part of strict measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Bank of Thailand (BOT) expects only 8 million foreign visitors this year, down 80% from a record 39.8 million last year, when foreign receipts accounted for 11.4% of GDP.
The central bank has forecast Southeast Asia's second-largest economy will shrink by a record 8.1%, with bottom seen in the second quarter, Governor Veerathai Santiprabhob told a seminar.
""It will take about two years for the economy to return to the levels before COVID-19,"" he said. ""It will be a long check mark recovery"".
The most worrying issue is employment, particularly in the service and manufacturing sector, Veerathai said.
Recent weakness in the baht  has been driven by capital outflows on economic and political concerns, Veerathai said, adding the currency would remain volatile.
The baht traded at 31.78 per U.S. dollar at 0540 GMT, around its lowest level in more than seven weeks.
However, fund outflows are not a worry as the country's external positions remain strong, with current account surpluses and low foreign debt, he said, adding the baht would remain 

He also said bad loans in the country would rise but new steps should prevent them from surging.

141,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 02:00AM ET</span>","EU leaders struggle with ""mission impossible"" at deadlocked recovery summit","By John Chalmers and Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU leaders stood at an impasse on Monday after three days of haggling over a plan to revive economies throttled by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the chairman of their near-record-length summit urged them to make one last push on ""mission impossible"".
Charles Michel reminded the 27 leaders of the European Union that more than 600,000 people had now died as a result of the coronavirus around the world, and it was up to them to stand together in the face of an unprecedented crisis.
""My hope is that we reach an agreement and that the headline ... tomorrow is that the EU has accomplished mission impossible,"" the European Council President said at their third dinner in a row at the Brussels conference centre. ""That is my heartfelt wish ... after three days of non-stop work.""
The leaders are at odds over how to carve up a vast recovery fund designed to help haul Europe out of its deepest recession since World War Two, and what strings to attach for countries it would benefit. 
Diplomats said the leaders may abandon the summit and try again for an agreement next month, but as they negotiated into the early hours of Monday a deal still looked possible.
On the table is a 1.8-trillion-euro ($2.06-trillion) package for the EU's next long-term budget and recovery fund. 
The 750 billion euros proposed for the recovery fund would be raised on behalf of them all on capital markets by the EU's executive European Commission, which would be a historic step towards greater integration, and then funnelled mostly to hard-hit Mediterranean rim countries.
BETTER AMBITIOUS THAN HURRIED
European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde said it would be better for the leaders to agree an ""ambitious"" aid package than to have a quick deal at any cost.
""Ideally, the leaders' agreement should be ambitious in terms of size and composition of the package ... even if it takes a bit more time,"" she told Reuters.
Lagarde's comments suggested she was relaxed about the possibility of an adverse reaction on financial markets if the summit fails, especially as the ECB has a 1 trillion euro-plus war chest to buy up government debt. 
A group of ""frugal"" wealthy north European states pushed during the summit for a smaller recovery fund and sought to limit how payouts are split between grants and repayable loans. 
The tense talks, though still slightly shorter that an EU summit in the French city of Nice 20 years ago, underscored the gulf between the EU's north and south.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte accused the Netherlands and its allies -- Austria, Sweden, Denmark and Finland -- of ""blackmail"".
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's position reflects political realities in his country, where voters resent that the Netherlands is, proportionately, among the largest net contributors to the EU budget. 
He and his conservative VVD party face a strong challenge from far-right eurosceptic parties in elections next March.
An attempt to reach a compromise failed on Sunday. A deal envisaging 400 billion euros in grants - down from a proposed 500 billion euros - was rejected by the north, which said it saw 350 billion euros as the maximum. 
There were also differences over a proposed new rule-of-law mechanism that could freeze funding to countries flouting democratic principles. Hungary, backed by Poland, threatened to veto the package if its disbursement was made dependent on meeting conditions on upholding the rule of law.
For some, the summit was a critical moment for nearly 70 years of European integration, and failure to agree could both unnerve financial markets and fuel doubts about the bloc's future.

The government announced plans to tackle a potential second wave of infections by setting aside NZ$14 billion ($9.16 billion) from a COVID Response and Recovery Fund included in this year's budget in May.
""The economy is doing better than expected and is more open than anywhere else in the world,"" Grant Robertson told a news conference.
""We want to manage debt as tightly as possible and remain prepared for a rainy day.""
Robertson said the government was no longer considering 'helicopter' cash handouts, or the direct distribution of free cash to individuals as a form of policy stimulus for the economy, a strategy it had said in May was being discussed.
Asked if such handouts were off the table, Robertson responded, ""For the foreseeable future, yes."" 
With 22 deaths from 1,204 virus infections, New Zealand has successfully contained COVID-19, and last reported a case of community transmission 80 days ago. Its active cases now stand at 26, all in managed isolation.

143,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 01:36AM ET</span>",EU Holdouts Ready to Accept 390 Billion Euros in Grants for Fund,"(Bloomberg) -- The four European Union governments that have been holding up negotiations over a massive stimulus package to reboot the bloc’s economy are ready to agree on a key plank of the deal, two officials said.
After negotiating through the night, the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark and Sweden are satisfied with 390 billion euros ($450 billion) of the fund being made available as grants with the rest coming as low-interest loans, the officials said, asking not be named discussing private conversations.
The bloc’s 27 leaders will gather again at 4 p.m. when they will be aiming to settle the outstanding issues such as the overall size of the fund and the mechanisms for controlling its spending. A French official said that their delegation now see a path to a full agreement.
“Tough negotiations just came to an end,” Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said in a tweet. “We can be very happy with today’s result. It will continue this afternoon.”
With investors already pricing in an agreement after a series of bold announcements in recent weeks, leaders are under intense pressure to bridge their differences. At times the discussions grew heated, with several officials saying the whole negotiation was on the brink of collapse during Sunday’s dinner session as familiar fault lines emerged between the richer northern nations and the southern countries worst affected by the coronavirus.
“It did not look good at a couple of moments tonight but taking everything together, I believe progress has been made,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said.
“We are willing to make the shift from loans to subsidies if reforms are taking place and if these reforms can be enforced,” he added. “There is a very good text on this now and my impression is that is has consensus support.”
Green Stimulus
Rutte and his allies have been trying to water down the handouts that the highly indebted southern countries sees as critical for shoring up their finances -- the European Commission’s initial proposal included 500 billion euros of grants.
Yet for all the frustration facing Rutte from the other side of the table, his opponents can’t afford to push him too far. The Dutch prime minister has just 75 deputies in his country’s 150-seat parliament so he’ll need opposition support to ratify any deal he strikes with the bloc.
The overall package under discussion is worth about 1.8 trillion euros. More than 1 trillion euros will be distributed in grants from the bloc’s regular budget with another 750 billion euros lined up for the emergency stimulus package. Germany contributes the lion’s share to the bloc’s budget.
Almost a third of this total will have to be committed to projects transforming the EU into a low-carbon economy. Expenditure that’s not consistent with the Paris Agreement on climate change won’t be approved, thus making the potential deal the biggest green stimulus the world has ever seen.

Indonesia overtook China on Saturday as the country with the most confirmed infections in East Asia. On Sunday, authorities also reported the highest daily increase in COVID-19 deaths with total cases at 86,521 and 4,143 fatalities.
BI at the beginning of the pandemic had predicted a V-shaped recovery, though it had since trimmed its gross domestic product outlook several times.
""With the development in cases continuing to rise, this makes it unlikely that there will be 100% relaxation (of coronavirus-related restrictions),"" she said. ""It will be gradual and this means the economy cannot recover quickly.""
BI officials last week said economic activity was the weakest in April and May, with the sharpest GDP contraction expected in the second quarter.
Damayanti, who holds the second-highest position at the central bank, said BI's prediction was for a second-quarter contraction of 4% to 4.8%, roughly in line with the government's prediction for a 4.3% contraction.
""If we choose to be defensive, with lockdowns or large-scale curbs, the economy may worsen,"" she said, describing Indonesia's current situation as ""survival mode"".
Meanwhile, fears of a prolonged global downturn has put pressure on emerging market assets, including the rupiah , as some investors returned to safe-haven assets, she said. The rupiah fell 0.9% on Monday to 14,745 a dollar at 0443 GMT.
BI was committed to help shore up the economy via bond-buying operations and rate cuts, Damayanti said, while pledging to be prudent in assessing the impact of such measures on inflation and the rupiah.

President Joko Widodo earlier this month said Indonesia's coronavirus outbreak was now expected to peak in August or September.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports plunged at a double-digit pace for the fourth month in a row in June, backing signs the coronavirus crisis has knocked the economy into its worst postwar recession and raising the spectre of a longer and more painful global downturn.
U.S.-bound Japanese shipments nearly halved again due to plummeting demand for cars and autoparts, while exports to China remained weak, pointing to the absence of a strong growth engine for the world economy.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data showed on Monday that Japan's exports dived 26.2% in June from a year earlier, bigger than a 24.9% decline seen by economists in a Reuters poll. The contraction slowed slightly from the prior month's 28.3% fall - the worst downturn since September 2009.
Global demand for cars and other durable goods has sunk since March as the pandemic prompted many countries to lockdown.
Though more countries have now started re-opening their economies, analysts say the trade data could diminish hopes for a quick rebound in global demand and Japan's export-led economy, especially given the resurgence of coronavirus cases in major economies like the United States, Brazil and India.
The International Monetary Fund last month forecast global output will shrink by 4.9% this year, versus a 3.0% contraction predicted in April. It also predicted a slower recovery in 2021, with growth of 5.4% for the year compared with a 5.8% rise seen in April.
""Exports are likely to seesaw for the time being,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""If domestic and external demand remain sluggish for a prolonged period, supply capacity could be slashed, triggering a jump in bankruptcies and job losses in the latter half of this fiscal year.""
U.S.-BOUND EXPORTS TANK
The latest slump was aggravated by a massive annual decline in U.S.-bound car shipments, a major export item for the Asian giant.
Overall shipments to the United States - Japan's key market - dived 46.6%, due to 63.3% decline in exports of automobiles, 56% drop in airplane engines and 58.3% fall in car parts.
Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201), Japan's No. 2 automaker, plans a 30% year-on-year cut in global car output through December as falling demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic complicates its turnaround efforts, two sources told Reuters. 
In 2018, the United States was Japan's largest export market, followed closely by China and led by cars and car parts.
Exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, fell 0.2% in the year to June, as declines in shipments of chip-making machinery and chemical materials more than offset increase in nonferrous metal and car shipments.
Shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of Japanese exports, declined 15.3%, and exports to the European Union fell 28.4%.
Japan slipped into recession for the first time in 4-1/2 years in the first quarter and is on course for its deepest postwar slump as the health crisis hurt businesses and consumers.
The world's third-largest economy is forecast to contract 5.3% this fiscal year, the biggest contraction since comparable data became available in 1994, followed by a 3.3% bounce next year, a Reuters poll of over 30 economists shows.
Reflecting weak demand and declining oil prices, imports fell 14.4% in the year to June, versus a 16.8% decrease seen by analysts, leading to a trade deficit of 268.8 billion yen ($2.51 billion).

The Bank of Japan has signalled confidence the economy will emerge from the slump and has ruled out the risk of deflation, although policymakers have debated such a prospect in the face of the pandemic-induced global slump in demand and prices.

The results highlight growing concerns that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's $16 billion ""Go To"" campaign, set to begin on Wednesday, could spread the virus to rural parts of the country where medical systems are fragile.
Broadcaster NHK said more than 500 new cases were reported nationally on Sunday, of which 188 were in Tokyo - down by about 100 from the previous day but still well above levels seen when Abe's government in late May called an end to a state of emergency it had imposed to contain the virus.
A telephone survey conducted by the Asahi newspaper found 74% of respondents were opposed to the campaign. In a similar survey by the Nikkei business daily, some 80% of respondents said it was too early to launch such a programme.
Japan has not seen the kind of rapid spread of the virus that has killed tens of thousands in other countries. But Tokyo has raised its coronavirus alert to the highest level after a series of fresh highs for new cases.
Under the ""Go To"" campaign, travellers are set to get subsidies of as much as 50% to boost tourism-reliant economies outside major population areas. With cases on the rise in the capital, the campaign - originally open to all - will now exclude people living or vacationing in Tokyo.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Bank of Japan policymakers debated the risk of the country sliding back into deflation but stopped short of advocating stronger steps to prevent firms from going insolvent due to the coronavirus pandemic, minutes of their June meeting showed.
With the impact of COVID-19 likely to last for a prolonged period, more companies could face the risk of insolvency even if they received immediate liquidity support, some on the BOJ's nine-member board were quoted as saying.
But those who spoke out on the matter said the BOJ ought to be cautious about directly injecting capital to save struggling firms, suggesting such action should be the preserve of the government.
""A few members said the BOJ's role was to provide liquidity, and that it was important for the BOJ to cooperate with the government while clarifying the respective roles,"" according to the minutes released on Monday.
After easing monetary policy in March and April, the BOJ kept policy settings unchanged at the June 15-16 meeting and maintained its view the economy will gradually recover from the damage caused by the pandemic.
But many board members remained gloomy on Japan's recovery prospects as the impact from the outbreak deepened, the minutes showed.
""The impact of the pandemic was broadening to companies of all size and sectors. If corporate bankruptcies and closures increased, there was a risk Japan could slip back into deflation,"" a few board members were quoted as saying.
Many members also said economic activity could be ""severely curtailed"" if there was a second wave of infections, the minutes showed.

Japan lifted nationwide state of emergency measures in late May but has seen a renewed spike in infections in its capital Tokyo, stoking fears of a second wave that could hit an already weakened economy. Japan has reported over 25,000 cases, including nearly 1,000 deaths.

The plan, called ""Step by Step,"" includes five stages that range from total quarantine to advanced opening and will be applied according to epidemiological criteria, the capacity of the healthcare system and the ability to trace cases, officials said.
""These five weeks of improvement allow us to start a new stage today ... This plan, which will be step by step, cautiously, prudently, will be applied gradually and flexibly,"" said President Sebastian Pinera in the announcement, adding that 12 regions in the country had improved in recent weeks. 
Much of the population of the world's largest copper producer, including in the capital Santiago, remains under lockdown as Chile works to control the spread of the virus, currently at 330,000 confirmed cases and more than 8,500 deaths. 
The government did not specify when ​​Santiago or the mining regions in the north of the country would move into a gradual reopening. 
Since the start of the pandemic in early March, Chile's government has imposed various measures to stem the spread of the virus, including border closures, a shut-down of trade and non-essential services, and a total quarantine for older adults.

149,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 19, 2020 04:09PM ET</span>",Australia Budget Blowout to Hit Post-War Record Amid Second Wave,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s government will deliver an economic and fiscal update that’s set to show the biggest budget blowout since World War II, while a second wave of infections delays the pivot of stimulus toward the recovery.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg will forecast a budget deficit of A$191.5 billion ($133.7 billion) -- around 10% of GDP -- for the 12 months through June 2021, a Bloomberg survey of economists showed ahead of the release in Canberra Thursday morning. They estimate the budget shortfall was A$93 billion in the fiscal year that ended last month.
The run-up to the Treasurer’s statement will also see addresses from the top monetary and finance officials: Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe on Tuesday and banking regulator chair Wayne Byres Wednesday.
A fresh Covid outbreak has forced the lockdown of the Victorian state capital, Melbourne, and new restrictions for restaurants, cafes and bars in New South Wales, torpedoing government plans to pivot from emergency fiscal infusions to facilitating the economic recovery. Frydenberg needs to navigate a path that assists these areas, while helping the rest of the country get back on its feet.
“The statement’s focus will be on jobs and confidence -- policy will be formulated solely around those key objectives that are obviously intertwined,” said Su-Lin Ong, head of economic and fixed-income strategy at Royal Bank of Canada. “Australia is fortunate that it has the fiscal scope to do this, it has the balance sheet. It means a lot of issuance, but there’s very strong demand because Australia still ticks a whole number of boxes for international investors.”
Although Australia added a record 210,000 jobs in June, the unemployment rate is now 7.4%, a 22-year high, and economists see it only edging down to 7.1% by June 2021. On top of that, household sentiment tumbled this month amid the renewed outbreak.
The government’s funding arm has been preparing its war chest for the spending ahead, with a record A$85.6 billion ($59.8 billion) of bonds sold in the three months through June, more than double the previous quarterly record. Yet with projections of gaping budget deficits ahead, the Australian Office of Financial Management will need to raise plenty more cash.
Victoria’s outbreak is significant because the state is responsible for about a quarter of national gross domestic product and employment. Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital Investors Ltd., reckons Melbourne’s lockdown will knock about 1% off GDP this quarter. There’s also “a high risk” it hits confidence in other states, he said.
The government is expected to clarify its intention for the JobKeeper program, a wage subsidy that keeps workers tied to their employers, and JobSeeker, an unemployment benefit that was doubled in response to the virus. Both are due to expire in September.
JobKeeper is likely to be extended because of Melbourne’s lockdown and some industries still struggling. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) suggests the eligibility criteria could be tightened, or limited to certain industries. CBA’s Gareth Aird said the JobSeeker A$550 coronavirus unemployment supplement could be cut to A$250 from October under a revised system.
RBA’s Lowe discussed the risks to the outlook when he kept the cash rate and three-year yield target at 0.25% this month.
“The nature and speed of the economic recovery remains highly uncertain,” he said. “Uncertainty about the health situation and the future strength of the economy is making many households and businesses cautious, and this is affecting consumption and investment plans.”

150,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>",Viktor Orban says 'the Dutchman' is responsible for EU summit disarray,"By Kate Abnett
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Sunday that Dutch leader Mark Rutte was responsible for the deadlock at a European Union summit, where leaders were set to haggle for a third day over a vast stimulus plan for their coronavirus-hit economies.
""I don't know what is the personal reason for the Dutch prime minister to hate me or Hungary, but he is attacking so harshly,"" he told reporters in front of the steps of a European history museum in a Brussels park, a short walk from the summit venue. 
""I don't like blame games but the Dutchman is the real responsible man for the whole mess... The Dutch prime minister, he is the fighter.""
Orban, a right-wing nationalist who has accumulated unprecedented powers since winning election a decade ago, has clashed with the EU's executive and other member states for years over his perceived backsliding from democratic governance.
A group of wealthy and fiscally ""frugal"" northern states led by the Netherlands has blocked progress at the summit towards agreement on a 750 billion euro fund to revive Europe's economies.
They want strict control over how funds are spent, and there has been a fierce argument over whether money could be withheld from countries that fail to live up to democratic standards.
Hungary, where Orban has tightened the noose around media, academics and civil society, threatened even before the summit got under way on Friday to veto the package over a proposal to freeze funds for states undercutting the rule of law.
""What's going on is a little bit strange because there is a 100% agreement on the rule of law,"" Orban said. ""If somebody is not ready to accept the rule of law [they] should leave the European Union immediately. They should not be punished by money.""
He said ""these guys who inherited freedom, rule of law and political democracy"" did not have the experience that he and others in eastern Europe had fighting against communism.
There was no immediate comment from Rutte's office.
Rutte told a news conference in the Hague on July 10 that developments in both Hungary and Poland were ""very worrying"".

""We have the principle of rule of law, and of democracy, and that Europe is not only a market and a currency, but also a community of values and you can have conditions,"" he said.

Debt-ridden South African Airways (SAA) has been in a form of bankruptcy protection since December. Its creditors approved a rescue plan last week that involves scaling down its fleet, shedding thousands of jobs and a commitment of over 10 billion rand ($599.6 million) from the government 
""Telkom is an interesting model that we could actually look at as we go forward,"" Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan said, adding that the new SAA cannot be run by a ""bunch of amateurs"".
He did not specify if the revamped airline will be a listed entity. 
Telkom SA (J:TKGJ), among the top three telecom service providers in Africa's most industrialised country, is run independently and not bound by government guidelines set up for most South African sate-owned enterprises.
The government directly holds a 37% stake in the listed entity and state-owned fund manager Public Investment Corp. owns around 15%. The rest is owned by institutional investors and the public.
Gordhan said the government was still trying to secure the 10 billion rand required for the business rescue plan to succeed. ""Now where it comes from, what form it comes in is something is still being worked on."" 
The public and finance ministries committed to finding the funds in a letter to the airline's administrators seen by Reuters last Thursday. This is in addition to more than 16 billion rand the finance ministry set aside in its February budget to repay SAA's guaranteed debt and debt-service costs. 

He reiterated that the restructured airline will have a strategic partner, professional aviation managers and a more simplified salary structure.

KUWAIT (Reuters) - Kuwait plans to issue between 4 billion and 5 billion dinars ($13 billion to $16 billion) in public debt by the end of the fiscal year ending March 2021 if parliament approves a long-debated debt law, a government document seen by Reuters showed.
Facing one of the worst economic crunches in the oil-exporting Gulf region, Kuwait is scrambling to boost state coffers badly hit by the coronavirus crisis and low crude prices, rapidly depleting its General Reserve Fund (GRF) to plug a budget deficit.
A parliamentary committee is due to vote on the law - which would allow Kuwait to tap international debt markets - on Sunday ahead of putting it to the elected assembly for approval.
Legislators have been requesting more visibility from the state about use of the funds and repayment mechanisms given the government's heavy reliance on oil income.
""The government will face a real crisis in everything if the debt law is not passed,"" a government official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
The law, which a parliamentary committee discussed last week, would allow it to borrow 20 billion dinars ($65 billion) over 30 years.
Other Gulf states have tapped international markets over the past few years and the region saw more issuances when oil prices crashed earlier this year as the pandemic hit global demand.
Even with parliamentary approval, Kuwait could need three to four months to prepare a debt sale, according to the government document.
A finance ministry official declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. 
Kuwait has already depleted the cash in its GRF, the document showed. The International Monetary Fund estimates the deficit could reach more than 11% of gross domestic product this year, compared with a 4.8% surplus last year. (https://tmsnrt.rs/30jiP6k)
The finance ministry also proposed selling 2.2 billion dinars of the GRF's assets to Kuwait's other - much larger - sovereign fund, the Future Generations Fund, or borrowing from the central bank to boost state finances, the document showed.
Finance Minister Barak al-Sheatan said in a statement published in state media on Saturday that the ministry submitted to cabinet ""available options for securing sufficient liquidity"" and that the government had approved an ""interim financial reform scheme"". He did not specify the measures approved.
""The government looks forward to the legislative authority's cooperation,"" Sheatan said in the statement issued after S&P Global Ratings on Friday revised Kuwait's outlook to 'negative' from 'stable'.
Kuwait's 91-year-old Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah underwent successful surgery on Sunday morning after being admitted to hospital on Saturday, his office said. His designated successor Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmed al-Sabah temporarily took over some of the ruler's constitutional duties on Saturday.
TAXES
The document said the cabinet approved a slate of reforms aimed at diversifying state revenues away from oil, but it did not specify them. 
Lawmaker Riyadh al-Adsani had tweeted that reforms include introducing value-added tax and excise taxes, a tax on net profits of private businesses, reforming the wage structure in the bloated public sector, slashing some benefits and raising utility prices.
Successive parliaments have hampered far reaching economic reform plans over the past decade in a country whose citizens are accustomed to a cradle-to-grave welfare system. Kuwait is due to hold parliamentary elections in the next several months.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) estimates its economy will contract by 7.8% this year, the biggest fall among Gulf states.

Last month Kuwait's government approved a cut to state entities' budgets by at least 20%. It is also considering making an annual 10% transfer of state revenue to the Future Generations Fund conditional on budget surpluses, a move that could save it some $3 billion in the current fiscal year.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian banks plan to reduce the amount customers can spend abroad using debit cards on Monday, two lenders said, as banks try to limit foreign currency settlement risk.
The country is facing dollar shortages because of the sharp fall in the price of oil, Nigeria's main export, and domestic banks are trying to avoid transactions with hard currency.
Stanbic IBTC Bank (LG:IBTC), the local unit of South Africa's Standard Bank (J:SBKJ), said it will halve the spending limit for offshore card transactions to $500 per month from Monday and will limit cash withdrawals to $100.
Another top tier lender Zenith Bank (LG:ZENITHB) said it will temporarily suspend the use of debit cards abroad for cash withdrawals and cut the monthly spending limit abroad by more than half to $200.
""This review is in response to today's economic realities,"" Zenith said in a notice, advising clients to request prepaid dollar cards.
Other lenders — Ecobank (LG:ETI) and Fidelity Bank (LG:FIDELIT) — have also lowered withdrawal limits for individuals while abroad.
Such moves have previously been at the behest of the central bank, but it was not clear if the regulator was behind the latest action. The central bank did not respond to a request for comment.
The bank is battling to conserve dollar reserves that are down 19% from a year ago. Last week it depreciated the currency on the official market  prompting the naira to weaken on the black and over-the-counter spot markets.
Bankers told Reuters that it now takes more than six months to settle foreign lines of credit.

Investing.com - The debate in the U.S. Congress over a new coronavirus-aid bill will gather pace this week and could be a main driver of market sentiment amid fears over an economic downturn once current benefits expire at the end of the month. Earnings will swing into high gear, with investors hoping that some big names could offer better news in what has been a dismal season so far. Thursday’s jobless claims report will likely show that the number of people filing for benefits barely declined once again, with millions still out of work. In the euro zone, leaders are still trying to hammer out a deal on a possible recovery fund worth 750 billion euro, while PMI data on Friday will give more insight into the speed of the post lockdown economic bounceback. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
Lawmakers in the U.S. Senate will resume contentious talks on a new coronavirus-aid bill this week as the U.S. economy approaches a critical stage in the recovery from the pandemic.
Extended unemployment benefits for the approximately 32 million Americans out of work are due to end on July 31. The expiration of the Federal program will leave millions of gig workers and the self employed among others, who do not qualify for regular state unemployment insurance, without an income.
On Thursday, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer unveiled a $350 billion investment plan, but Republicans have said they hope the final package will not cost more than $1 trillion.
With the two sides still far apart on several issues, analysts fear that a less generous package of aid measures will mean that the already fragile economic rebound will lose momentum in the coming months.
The second quarter earnings season is on course to see the largest drop in profits since the fourth quarter of 2008 according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, but investors are hoping that results from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) could offer some cheer this week.
Tesla, which has seen a strong rally this year, is due to report its latest quarterly earnings on Wednesday. If it posts a profit it would mark its first cumulative four-quarter profit, paving the way for its addition to the S&P 500.
Tech giant Microsoft reports results Wednesday, followed by Intel on Thursday, with both seen likely to have benefited from remote working trends during the pandemic.
Other big names reporting this week include United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Snap (NYSE:SNAP), AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG).
With renewed economic shutdowns in California, Florida and Texas market watchers will be paying close attention to Thursday’s data on initial jobless claims.
Economists say unemployment remains uncomfortably high because of a second wave of layoffs, which could intensify as the resurgence of the virus depresses demand and increases bankruptcies, especially in the retail sector.
""The data are likely underestimating the true state of the labor market,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Firms are starting to warn there could be major layoffs in the months to come.""
German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that European Union leaders may not reach a deal on a coronavirus stimulus plan on Sunday as marathon negotiations ran into a third day and tensions mounted over the demands of wealthy but more frugal member states.
Germany and France, the EU's powerbrokers, are seeking a deal on a 1.8 trillion euro ($2.06 trillion) economic recovery package to rescue the bloc's economies that are facing their worst recession since World War Two.
Failure to come together amid an unprecedented health and economic crisis would raise serious questions about the continued viability of the bloc, officials and experts say.
While it's possible that a deal could reached this week it’s more likely that at least one more summit will be needed before an agreement is struck.
PMI figures from Germany, France, the euro zone and the UK on Friday will provide more insight on the strength of the post lockdown economic rebound in July.
But the PMI data does not measure the extent to which economic activity has recovered compared to the pre-virus level and, while it signals how broad-based the recovery is, it cannot give information on the rate of the recovery.
Meanwhile, UK retail sales figures, also due out on Friday are expected to show a further rebound, but with more consumers shopping online an increasing number of retailers are likely to begin making redundancies over coming weeks.

WASHINGTON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Finance officials from the Group of 20 countries on Saturday called for all official bilateral creditors to implement fully a short-term debt freeze for the world's poorest countries, but stopped short of extending the initiative into next year.
Sources briefed on the G20 meeting said there was strong support for extending the standstill beyond the end of 2020, given the severity of the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, but the group's final communique said only that the issue would be considered in the second half of 2020.
It also said nothing about growing calls for cancelling - not just deferring - the debts of some of the poorest countries.
The Debt Service Suspension Initiative, agreed by G20 ministers in April, has proven challenging to implement, with only 42 of 73 eligible countries expressing interest thus far, saving just $5.3 billion in service payments instead of the $12 billion initially promised.
World Bank officials have singled out China, a G20 member and the largest creditor for developing nations, for holding back debts owed to its state-owned development and state-owned companies.
World Bank President David Malpass also told G20 officials on Saturday that they needed to ""open the door"" to talks on reducing the overall debt overhang for the poorest countries.
Failure of the private sector to participate has also been a growing concern. The Institute for International Finance last week said its members had not received any formal requests for debt relief from countries eligible for the DSSI.
The communique did not mention China, but G20 officials said they would closely monitor implementation of the debt freeze and noted efforts to set up a fiscal monitoring framework to strengthen the quality of debt data and improve debt disclosure.
""All official bilateral creditors should implement this initiative fully and in a transparent manner,"" they said.
They also said they ""strongly encourage"" commercial lenders to provide relief when requested.
Decisions on extending the freeze would come after the International Monetary Fund and World Bank complete a report on the liquidity needs of countries before the next G20 finance officials' meeting in October, the communique said.
The UK-based Jubilee Debt Campaign said the G20's failure to take swifter and more decisive action would cost poor countries billions of dollars each month.
""We needed rapid and concerted action, but instead the G20 have backtracked,"" said Sarah-Jayne Clifton, director of Jubilee Debt Campaign, one of many groups that have called for extending the debt freeze and expanding it.
More than 200 religious, labor, human rights, environmental and development groups signed a separate letter spearheaded by Jubilee USA Network that was sent this week to G20 leaders, the White House and the IMF.

RIYADH/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Finance officials from the Group of 20 major economies vowed on Saturday to continue using ""all available policy tools"" to fight the coronavirus pandemic and bolster the global economy, warning that the outlook remains highly uncertain.
G20 finance ministers and central bankers, in a communique issued after a virtual meeting on Saturday, said the global economy would recover as economies gradually reopen, but said further actions were needed to ensure growth.
""We are determined to continue to use all available policy tools to safeguard people’s lives, jobs and incomes, support global economic recovery, and enhance the resilience of the financial system, while safeguarding against downside risks,"" they said in statement after the meeting ended.
COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, has infected more than 14.14 million people and killed 596,576​, according to a Reuters tally. The United States, the world's largest economy, tops the list of deaths.
Sweeping shutdowns aimed at halting the spread of the disease have caused massive disruption to the global economy, and are hitting the world's poorest countries hardest.
G20 finance officials said 42 of the world's 73 poorest countries had requested a freeze in official bilateral debt payments through the end of the year, amounting to about $5.3 billion in deferred payments.
Reflecting concerns raised by the World Bank that China, a G20 member and the largest creditor to developing countries, was not participating fully, the officials urged all official bilateral creditors to implement the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) fully and transparently.
They also ""strongly encouraged"" private creditors to participate on comparable terms, and said they would consider extending the debt standstill in the second half of 2020.
Private creditors had not received any formal requests from countries for debt service suspension under the G20 initiative, the Institute for International Finance (IIF) said on Wednesday, ahead of Saturday's meeting.
""We encourage the private sector investors to participate in this, but we need to be very careful not to interfere on private agreements,"" Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said in a press conference at the end of the meeting.
Saudi Arabia is the current G20 chair.
The officials also reaffirmed their commitment to resolving differences over how to tax digital services and reaching a broad, consensus-based solution this year.
They said they expected to see proposals on international tax reform by October, when they meet again.

""Fair taxation of international companies and large digital groups is more urgent than ever,"" German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said after the meeting.

WARSAW/ROME (Reuters) - A stand-off between EU leaders at a summit in Brussels on Saturday threatened to derail plans for a massive stimulus fund to breathe life into their coronavirus-hammered economies.
""We are in an impasse now. It is more complex than what was expected,"" Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in a video on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) as the 27 European Union leaders neared the end of a second day of talks. ""There are many issues that remain unresolved.”
The budget commissioner of the bloc's executive reminded the leaders - who wore masks and kept their distance from each other - that COVID-19 was still among them and they needed to act.
""Just a solemn reminder: the Corona crisis is not over: infections on the rise in many countries,"" Johannes Hahn tweeted. ""High time to reach an agreement which allows us to provide the urgently needed support for our citizens+economies!""
With the pandemic dealing Europe its worst economic shock since World War Two, leaders gathered on Friday to haggle over a proposed 750 billion euro ($856 billion) recovery fund and a 2021-27 EU budget of more than 1 trillion euros.
But a group of wealthy and fiscally ""frugal"" northern states led by the Netherlands have blocked progress in the first face-to-face EU summit since spring lockdowns across the continent.
They favour repayable loans rather than free grants for the hard-hit indebted economies mostly on the Mediterranean rim, and they want control over how the funds are spent.
Hopes for an agreement grew earlier on Saturday when the summit's chairman, European Council President Charles Michel, proposed revisions to the overall package that were designed to assuage the Dutch concerns.
LATEST IN SERIES OF EU CRISES
Under the new proposals, the portion of grants in the recovery fund would be reduced to 450 billion euros from 500 billion and an 'emergency brake' on disbursement would be added.
But hopes that this would be enough to get a deal faded quickly.
""The chance is very slim that an agreement will be reached tonight. Very slim,"" a diplomat from an EU member state said.
The diplomat said ""frugals"" were pressing for deeper cuts to the fund and bigger rebates for net payers into the core EU budget, among other demands.
Other countries had their own demands in negotiations criss-crossing different regional and economic priorities, putting in doubt an unprecedented act of solidarity for the EU under which the European Commission would borrow billions of euros on capital markets on behalf of them all.
The EU is already grappling with the protracted saga of Britain's exit from the bloc and has been bruised by past crises, from the financial meltdown of 2008 to feuds over migration.
Another economic shock could expose it to more eurosceptic, nationalist and protectionist forces, and weaken its standing against China, the United States or Russia.
The exact size of the EU's long-term budget and how far to use payouts as leverage for reforms, or whether to withhold money from countries that fail to live up to democratic standards, were still unresolved on Saturday evening.
Hungary, backed by its eurosceptic, nationalist ally Poland, has threatened to veto the whole package over a new envisaged mechanism to freeze out countries flouting democratic principles.

As leaders huddled in groups to find a way forward, an EU diplomat said that Michel would come up with another revision to the package before they gathered for dinner.

Previously announced tax relief that were due to expire in September, have been extended until the end of the year, a statement said. They include tax breaks for some manufacturing workers and small and medium-size enterprises, and a discount on corporate tax installments. 
The government has also expanded the type of companies eligible to apply for the tax breaks, including, for example, forestry businesses in the scheme.
It has allocated nearly $50 billion in state spending to fight the coronavirus pandemic. That, and a projected drop in fiscal revenues, are seen expanding its 2020 budget deficit by more than three times the government's original plan, to 6.34% of gross domestic product.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati has previously said the tax breaks were meant to prevent ""massive bankruptcies"".
The government's forecast for the economy, Southeast Asia's largest, ranges between a 0.4% contraction and a 1% growth. It grew 5% last year. 

On Saturday, Indonesia overtook China as the country with the most confirmed coronavirus cases in East Asia, with 84,882 infections and 4,016 deaths.

The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) said in a statement that financial institutions in the flood-hit areas cannot blindly withdraw, delay or cut credit lines to the companies who have good development prospects but whose operations were suspended by the floods.
The regulator also encouraged financial institutions to lower lending rates appropriately and improve their loan extension policy to help relevant companies to tide over difficulties.
Separately, the CBIRC urged insurers to properly perform investigations and claims settlement and arrange financial resources in advance to help flood-hit companies and people resume production and normal lives in a timely manner.
Large parts of China were reeling on Friday from the worst floods in decades, which destroyed homes and affected millions of people.
Economic activity in some parts of China, especially construction and steel and cement demand, has also been hurt by the flooding, analysts say, suggesting some loss of momentum after a stronger than expected bounce in the second quarter from the coronavirus crisis.

The regional Fed bank looked at eviction data from 44 U.S. cities and counties, finding it fell sharply in the early days of the economic crisis caused by the pandemic as many jurisdictions enacted bans on eviction filings, hearings or both.
""As of July 7, roughly one-third of rental units in our study are no longer covered by temporary policies, and eviction filings have now returned to their prepandemic levels in those places no longer covered,"" the researchers wrote. Filings remain lower in areas that have continued their bans.
Moreover, it could get worse in the weeks ahead as a number of the emergency relief programs enacted by Congress to assist tens of millions of unemployed Americans start to expire at the end of July.
""In addition to expiring eviction bans, renter households face expiring supplemental unemployment benefits offered through the CARES Act in spite of a still-elevated unemployment rate, a situation which further raises the risk of eviction for households impacted by the crisis,"" the researchers - Rebecca Cowin, Hal Martin, and Clare Stevens - wrote in their report https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clevelandfed.org%2Fen%2Fnewsroom-and-events%2Fpublications%2Fcommunity-development-briefs%2Fdb-20200717-measuring-evictions-during-the-covid-19-crisis.aspx&data=02%7C01%7CDaniel.Burns%40thomsonreuters.com%7Ca7ad44a32b6647d7cda308d82a92fb8c%7C62ccb8646a1a4b5d8e1c397dec1a8258%7C0%7C0%7C637306158061542359&sdata=sKXJpPey5bMVCuQ%2Fw9J4Z65TBlpDY15bNqOtSIuxr4o%3D&reserved=0.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Members of the U.S. women's national soccer side are using their experience as female entrepreneurs to lend their support to businesses selling everything from coffee to lingerie, as part of the team's mission to try to level the playing field for women.
A project called Stacy's Rise will award 15 female entrepreneurs $10,000 each, as well as advertising services and executive mentorship from successful women, including U.S. soccer World Cup champions Christen Press and Tobin Heath.
Press and Heath, who launched online clothing retailer Re-Inc last year with teammates Megan Rapinoe and Meghan Klingenberg, said they wanted to impart some of the lessons they learned from that experience.
""The exciting part is sharing our experiences as female entrepreneurs with others,"" Press told Reuters this week.
""And coming from a sports background, we have amazing access to people and a world class team. And we've had amazing mentors.""
Heath said she felt fortunate to ""get to give"" back.
""What we've gained from mentorship to what we'll be able to give to these 15 winners is really powerful,"" she said.
LONG LEGAL BATTLE
The team grabbed headlines last year when it filed a lawsuit against U.S. Soccer, claiming gender discrimination.
A judge threw out players' claims that they were underpaid in comparison with the men's team, but allowed claims over unfair medical services, travel and training to proceed to trial, which is set for Sept. 15.
The teams plan to appeal the ruling over wages.
Press said that rather than be discouraged, she is inspired by the outpouring of support for their cause.
""Our lawsuit was never going to be easy and we knew that going into it,"" she said.
""No team is better prepared for a long and hard fight than the U.S. women's national team.""
Press, who is Black, said she had been inspired by the protests against racial injustice that followed the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis in May.
And although the coronavirus pandemic has been devastating, she said it had also created a space for people to reflect on the type of world in which they want to live.
""It is definitely both sides of the coin and an emotional rollercoaster, but I think in my lifetime this is one of the greatest opportunities to create systemic change,"" she said.
The pandemic has forced the postponement of the 2020 Tokyo Games, where the team was favored to win a fifth Olympic gold medal.
Heath said the players was disappointed not to play but will be ready when international competition can resume.
""There will be a time when hopefully everything can return safely,"" Heath said.

""And I know for myself and Christen, we are looking forward to that and will be ready once it comes.""

Morneau told a news conference that Ottawa would drop an earlier requirement stipulating that businesses needed to show a 30% drop in revenue to be eligible. The changes will come into effect in July and will run to Dec 19, he added.
Some firms had complained the eligibility rules were too onerous and could prevent them from fully reopening for fear they would lose access to the subsidy.
""(It's) critical that we have businesses able to continue to hire people even as they get into the restart and we know the requirement that businesses have a 30% reduction in revenue is not helpful,"" said Morneau.
""Businesses will get the wage subsidy if they have had any reduction in revenue. ... It broadens the number of organizations and helps them to restart.""
Morneau also said firms which had suffered more than a 50% loss of revenue would get an additional subsidy of up to 25%. Canada has provided more than C$212 billion ($156.22 billion) in direct COVID-19 aid for those hit by the outbreak and nearly 14% of gross domestic product in total support.

The data marks the largest increase in the four decades that the agency has tracked it but is skewed by a more sobering reality: massive job losses among lower-wage workers.
“The unusually large increase in median weekly earnings in the second quarter reflects the fact that employment declined more for lower-paid workers than for higher-paid workers,” the report noted.
The trend first started to become clear in labor-market data in April, after businesses across the U.S. shuttered to stem the spread of the virus, putting millions out of work. It’s become more pronounced since.
Median weekly earnings of the nation’s 104.5 million full-time salaried workers surpassed $1,000 for the first time as of June 30, according to the report.
In essence, workers at the lower end of the wage scale --including retail and restaurant staff -- lost a disproportionate number of jobs during the Covid-induced business closures. That pushed up average hourly pay for those left working.
By race, Asians working at full-time jobs earned the most at $1,336, followed by Whites, who made $200 a week more than Blacks. Median weekly earnings of Hispanics were lowest at $786.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday policymakers should consider blanket forgiveness for all smaller businesses that received ""Paycheck Protection Program"" loans.
Mnuchin told lawmakers that they should consider such an approach to reduce complexity, coupled with some form of fraud protection. 
He also said the Trump administration supports adding more funds to the $660 billion program, as well as allowing especially hard-hit businesses to apply for a second emergency loan.
He did not define how small a loan would have to be to qualify for automatic forgiveness, and added it should be paired with some form of fraud protection without going into detail. Several business and banking groups have pushed for blanket forgiveness for all loans under $150,000, arguing the requirements for applying for forgiveness under the program are too complex.
His comments come as Congress is preparing further economic relief legislation to support businesses and people harmed by pandemic lockdowns. Roughly $100 billion remains in the PPP, a forgivable loan program created by the initial stimulus package, is set to expire on Aug. 8.
Mnuchin added that he would also support applying some sort of ""revenue test"" to future PPP loans to make sure the remaining funds go to businesses that need it the most. The PPP has come under criticism after wealthy and larger companies secured loans under the program, which was billed as relief for small businesses.
""This time, we need to have a revenue test and make sure that money is going to businesses that have significant revenue declines,"" he said.

He also said he would support efforts to set aside a portion of remaining PPP funds for minority-owned businesses, amid concerns from some lawmakers that those businesses were struggling to secure funding.

“It is possible, though not certain,” that the Fed will implement yield-curve control, they wrote on the Brookings Institution website, laying out testimony delivered Friday to the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis.
The Fed has looked into the possibility of capping yields on short- to medium-term Treasuries though policy makers have suggested that further study is needed before deciding whether or not to go ahead.
Yellen told the committee that it would be a “catastrophe” if Congress decided not to continue enhanced unemployment insurance that is due to expire at the end of this month. “We need the spending that those unemployed workers can do,” she said.
Under the program, unemployed workers receive an extra $600 a week. Yellen said the program could be restructured to cap total insurance payments at a fixed percentage of regular income.
In their Brookings posting, Bernanke and Yellen said they expect the Fed to provide clearer guidance on its plans for short-term interest rates as a way to provide more stimulus to the economy.
Forward Guidance
“To maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, the Federal Open Market Committee likely will provide forward guidance about the economic conditions it would need to see before it considers raising its overnight target rate,” the two former policy makers, both of whom now work at Brookings, wrote. “And it likely will clarify its plans for further securities purchases.”
The Fed has pledged to keep short-term interest rates effectively at zero until it is confident that the economy has weathered the pandemic shock and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price-stability goals.
The former Fed chairs also called for more action on the fiscal front, including aid to state and local governments and a continuation of enhanced unemployment insurance.
“If the pandemic comes under better control, economic recovery should follow. However, the pace of the recovery could be slow and uneven,” they wrote. ‘’Fiscal and monetary policies must aim to speed the recovery and minimize the recession’s lasting effects.”

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's Social Democrat Finance Minister Olaf Scholz is facing calls from rival parties to account for the regulatory failures that led to the collapse of Wirecard after it emerged he knew of concerns about the company 18 months ago.
The payment services company filed for insolvency last month after disclosing a 1.9 billion euro ($2.2 billion) hole in its accounts that auditors blamed on a global accounting fraud.
Scholz, seen as the party's best hope to succeed conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel next year, was informed in February 2019 that investigators were looking in ""all directions"" when regulators banned short-selling of Wirecard's shares, according to a parliamentary report seen by Reuters.
While there is no suggestion that Scholz knew of any malpractice, rival parties have suggested the Social Democrats' (SPD) most prominent politician bears responsibility for regulators' failure to spot problems.
""The fact that Olaf Scholz was informed as early as early 2019 about the Wirecard case strengthens the sense of a collective failure of responsibility,"" said Danyal Bayaz, finance spokesman for the Greens, who have moved into second place in the polls by eating into the SPD's voter base.
Merkel's Christian Democrats, in coalition with the SPD, also urged Scholz to stop ""looking away"" and focus on the alleged supervisory failings by BaFin, the markets regulator for which Scholz is responsible.
The complaints have so far had little impact on Scholz, who is among Germany's most popular politicians. But they could yet hurt his beleaguered party, which has few leadership candidates left after a string of electoral setbacks.
For now, the party remains committed to their main hope, with legislators accusing the other parties of mud-slinging.

""I see no reason for the Wirecard scandal to be dangerous for Olaf Scholz,"" said SPD legislator Jens Zimmermann. ""He had to go along with what BaFin was telling him.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is forecast to shrink by 6.6% in 2020 due to the shock of the coronavirus pandemic, but a resurgence in coronavirus infections and a systemic increase in poverty could worsen that outlook, the staff of the International Monetary Fund warned on Friday.
After concluding a regular Article IV review of the world's largest economy, IMF staff cited other risks, including a big increase in government and corporate debt levels, and the prospect of a long period of low, or even negative, inflation.
""There are tremendous uncertainties surrounding the economic propagation of the COVID-19 shock,"" they said in a note. ""It will likely take a prolonged period to repair the economy and to return activity to pre-pandemic levels.""
It said U.S. policymakers had acted quickly and assertively to protect U.S. lives and businesses, but further policy steps would be needed to boost demand and support the most vulnerable.
The coronavirus has infected more than 3.5 million Americans and killed nearly 140,000, both figures leading the world. The country shattered a daily record on Thursday, reporting more than 77,000 new cases, a Reuters tally showed.
The IMF staff said cited urgent warning signs that the crisis was hitting poor Americans and racial minorities the hardest, and would lead to a systemic increase in poverty. That would increase risks to the overall economy and could contribute to social unrest, they said.
""The risk ahead is that a large share of the U.S. population will have to contend with an important deterioration of living standards and significant economic hardship for several years to come,"" the note said. ""This, in turn, can further weaken demand and exacerbate longer-term headwinds to growth.""
It said the United States should reverse existing trade restrictions and tariff increases that were undermining global trade stability, and warned against treating undervalued currencies as countervailable subsidies.

It said the U.S. financial system had proven resilient, but the crisis was still at an early stage and banks should continue to restrain capital distribution plans.

BOSTON(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen's Point72 Asset Management is opening the $16.2 billion firm's latest satellite location in Warsaw and moving some back office operations to lower-cost Poland.
Point72, based in Stamford, Connecticut with 1,500 employees around the world, expects to hire 150 people in Warsaw by the end of 2021.
Some jobs will be moved to Poland from the United States, but the move would impact less than 5% of the workforce, a Point72 spokeswoman said.
Point72 plans to build technology, finance and operations teams in Poland, capitalizing on the country's highly educated workforce and geographic location. The firm, which employs teams of traders to invest in stocks, bonds and other instruments, does not expect to move investment professionals to Poland.
""The Warsaw office will be instrumental in supporting the firm's continued strategic growth and strengthening our investment services functions,"" the spokeswoman said. 
Point72 has 10 offices, including New York, London, Paris, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore, Sydney, Palo Alto, San Francisco and its Stamford headquarters.
Many financial services firms, including hedge funds, have scaled back on real estate recently to cut costs as investors are especially sensitive to high fees. 
Rafa Lopez Espinosa, Point72's U.S.-based global head of strategy, will move to Poland where he will continue in his current role and lead the local office.
Point72 grew out of Cohen's hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors when the firm resumed managing money for clients other than Cohen's family members in 2018. The firm was banned from serving outside clients for a time after it pleaded guilty plea to securities fraud charges. 
Assets have swelled from $11 billion in 2018, when the firm was managing only Cohen's private fortune, to $16.2 billion now. In the first half of 2020, the firm returned 4%.

The announcement extends the Fed's pandemic safety net to a new sector of the economy, one that may face unique financial struggles given the likely dip in charitable donations during the health crisis, and the possible blow to things like school enrollment and participation in youth sports leagues. 
The Fed estimated that the thousands of non-profits eligible for loans, from hospitals and colleges to small community groups, account for about 10% of U.S. jobs, or roughly 13 million people. 
Final loan documents are still being developed, but the terms announced Friday were broadened significantly from an initial proposal in mid-June. Along with lowering the employee threshold from 50 workers, the Fed will allow non-profits to get more of their revenue from donations as opposed to service fees, and to operate on slimmer margins.
Institutions with endowments greater than $3 billion are not eligible.
""We have listened carefully and adapted our approach so that we can best support them in carrying out their vital mission,” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement.
The $600 billion Main Street program was announced in March to get credit beyond the financial firms the Fed usually works with and into the “real” economy during the coronavirus crisis. 
The first loans were only disbursed in the last week, and have so far totaled just $12 million. Critics say the five-year loans are not on liberal enough terms to help struggling companies, and are not needed by healthy ones.

Non-profits and their advocates pushed hard for inclusion. They are largely subject to the same terms as companies. Interest will be charged at 3 percentage points over a reference rate, and the loans must be made by a participating bank willing to keep 5% on its own books.

178,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>",U.S. Consumer Sentiment Posts Surprise Drop After Surge in Virus,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer sentiment slumped in July, missing all forecasts, after the resurgent coronavirus nearly wiped out any emerging optimism around reopenings.
The University of Michigan’s preliminary sentiment index decreased 4.9 points to 73.2, according to data Friday, reversing most of the prior month’s 5.8-point gain. The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a slight increase to 79, with estimates ranging from 75 to 85.
The gauge of current conditions dropped 3.9 points to 84.2, while a measure of expectations declined 6.1 points to 66.2.
The decline is a potentially troubling sign for the economy and underlines that confidence and consumer spending will be closely tied to whether the rapidly spreading coronavirus is brought under control. Americans’ economic health also depends on whether lawmakers extend benefits such as the extra $600 in weekly unemployment payments that are set to lapse this month.
“Unfortunately, declines are more likely in the months ahead as the coronavirus spreads and causes continued economic harm, social disruptions, and permanent scarring,” Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said in a statement. Without further action by Congress, “another plunge in confidence and a longer recession is likely.”
Stocks struggled to maintain early gains and Treasury yields were little changed after the figures.
Americans’ view of the five-year economic outlook declined to the lowest level since 2014, while expectations for personal finances as well as current buying conditions for durable goods also declined.
One bright spot in the report was a greater share of consumers reporting an improvement in their personal financial situation, though the gains were concentrated among younger and upper-income households.
The decline in sentiment spanned partisan lines, with Democrats, independents and Republicans all seeing drops, though Democrats remained far more pessimistic than Republicans.
The Michigan survey was conducted June 24 through July 15. The final consumer sentiment report for July will be issued July 31.

179,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",U.S. Bank CEOs Warn of Tougher Economic Road After Recent Gains,"(Bloomberg) -- The road to recovery for the U.S. economy will be uneven, unclear and uncertain as the coronavirus retains its hold on business and Americans’ everyday activities, according to the heads of the nation’s biggest banks.
In the wake of brighter data on employment, retail sales and housing over the last two months, most financial-institution executives curbed their enthusiasm about the economy during the kickoff to the latest earnings season -- even as some of their own profits rose.
“There is no question as reopening has occurred, we’ve seen a pickup in that activity,” David Solomon, chief executive officer at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., said on the firm’s July 15 earnings call. But with a recent uptick in Covid-19 cases in several states “and this uncertainty persisting, I think you’ll see a flattening in that economic pickup and that will slow the progress we make.”
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon was just, if not more, skeptical that the recent pace of improvement in the economy will endure.
“You’re going to have a much murkier economic environment going forward than you had in May and June,” Dimon said on JPMorgan’s July 14 call. “You are going to have a lot of ins and out. You are going to have people scared about Covid. They’re going to be scared about the economy, small businesses, big companies, bankruptcies, emerging markets. So it just could be murky.”
While employers have added 7.5 million workers to their payrolls in the past two months, the number of Americans on state jobless benefit rolls remains stubbornly high at more than 17 million. Meantime, the virus continues to inject a steady stream of uncertainty into recovery efforts. Some 22 states have either reversed or paused reopenings, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). economists.
Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan told analysts Thursday that “baseline projections now extend the length of the recessionary environment into 2022, deep into 2022.”
Michael Corbat,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).’s CEO, is viewing the virus-economic relationship through four stages -- containment, stabilization, normalization and ultimately a return to growth.
“I would describe right now that, broadly in the world, we are somewhere between containment and stabilization,” Corbat said on the firm’s July 14 call. The stabilization phase would include removal of some actions put in place to contain the virus, such as social distancing.
“Normalization to me is: Am I willing to get on the airliner, am I willing to get in a subway, am I willing to go into a crowded venue to watch a sporting event or a concert or what it may be?” Corbat said, adding that that won’t occur until “a vaccine that’s available for the mass population.”
For its part, the Federal Reserve has effectively ensured the proper function of capital markets, according to Charles Scharf,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.’s CEO.
“However, the economic recovery will not be smooth,” Scharf said on the bank’s July 14 call. “Much of the economy is still essentially closed. We’re just beginning to open, and additional restrictions are being implemented as the spread of the virus continues to increase in many areas of the world.”

180,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>",The EU recovery fund's feast for the East,"By Marc Jones and Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Commission’s proposed 750 billion euro ($853.35 billion) coronavirus recovery fund for EU member states implies an unexpectedly generous package for countries in central and eastern Europe that could significantly benefit their economies.
The CEE region accounts for around 11% of the 27-member European Union's gross domestic product but has been provisionally allocated 187 billion euros, or 25%, of the 'Next Generation EU' plan's money.
In gross terms, Poland and Romania would receive the largest sums in CEE at 65 billion euros 33 billion euros respectively. Scaled as share of GDP, Croatia and Bulgaria would get the biggest boost.
""The extent to which CEE countries, many outside of the Euro area, are supported by the EC’s recovery package came as a positive surprise to the market,"" analysts at JP Morgan said.
(Graphic: Potential allocation of EU recovery fund as share of GDP, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegpbmrxkvq/Pasted%20image%201594924346874.png)
The recovery fund proposal is currently split between 500 billion euros of loans and 250 billion of 'grants'. The money is intended for projects spanning 2021-2024, though absorption could be allowed to leak into 2025-2026 as well.
It comes alongside the proposed 1.1 trillion euros EU’s regular seven-year budget for 2021-2027, meaning the CEE bloc could draw in a lot of money over that period.
The recovery fund will likely come with substantial strings attached. The 'grants' portion will be distributed to finance specific projects in line with the Commission’s agenda and subject to its authorisation.
That has rankled with Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose criticisms of Brussels and clampdowns on academics, media freedom and civil society have long been a thorn in the EU's side.
What Poland gets will be also be closely watched. The EU has been voicing concerns about an erosion of democracy there too https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20200109IPR69907/rule-of-law-in-poland-and-hungary-has-worsened and Poland's freshly re-elected President Andrzej Duda ran an acrimonious campaign laced with homophobic language and attacks on private and foreign-owned media.
(Graphic: Coronavirus has caused huge slump in CEE economies, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyvrrgagve/Pasted%20image%201594920899785.png)
Central and eastern European economies outperformed after the global financial crisis a decade ago. Taking into account the increased funding, they should be able to consistently outgrow their Western European neighbours.
However, given the lags in absorbing EU money, the degree to which this can materialise is unclear.
Looking only at investment-related disbursements, analysts calculate annual investment funding for CEE countries could range from 2.4% of GDP in the Czech Republic to 8.5% in Croatia. In some countries, such as Bulgaria and Croatia, available funds could exceed public sector investment.
Disbursements of EU funds could also significantly reduce borrowing needs for many countries, though the loan portion would have to be repaid.
Due to the Czech Republic's high income and low debt levels, it could find itself a net contributor to the pot for the first time under NGEU, even if only by a symbolic net 0.3% of GDP.

In the short term, German stimulus could prove even more important, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY)'s Marek Drimal added, given how much CEE firms sell to Germany and its manufacturers.

We knew Q2 earnings would be dire but the hope was a) they might turn out to be better than feared and b) companies could offer guidance on the outlook. So while expectations are for European Q2 earnings to slump 50%-plus, there's margin for error. 
Scandinavian banks, first out of the blocks, have surprised positively, with DNB, SEB, Swedbank and Handelsbanken beating forecasts. Trading revenues were a bright spot for them, and for many U.S. lenders so that segment should perform well in the rest of Europe too. Investors will also watch for banks' loan-loss provisions, after large amounts were set aside in Q1.
There are hopes, too, that sectors such as industrials might have benefited from recovering June activity. Those due to report include Unilever (NYSE:UL), , chipmaker STMicro and pharma Roche

2/SHOW US THE MONEY, TESLA
This year's 260% surge in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc shares has widened the divide between the electric carmaker's sceptics and believers. All eyes therefore will be on its Q2 earnings report, due July 22. Higher-than-expected Q2 vehicle deliveries, announced earlier this month, have raised hopes the company will defy Wall Street estimates to show a profit. It would mark Tesla's first cumulative four-quarter profit, a key hurdle it needs to vault to join the S&P 500. 
Tesla doesn't have a great track record of delivering positive surprises - only in six of the last 17 quarters did it top Wall Street analysts' mean estimate for GAAP net income. And this time too, a GAAP net loss of $275.2 million is expected, Refinitiv IBES data shows.

3/PUNCH-DRUNK 
China's national drink 'baijiu' doesn't froth like beer, but there was froth a-plenty in the shares of premium baijiu maker Kweichow Moutai Co., China's most valuable company. So much so that authorities felt the need to temper their rise.
The stock tumbled and Chinese equities had their worst week in five months, after the influential People's Daily thundered: ""alcohol is meant for drinking, not for speculation or corruption"". 
But warnings about the $285 billion Moutai stock were likely aimed at calming tipsy markets, rather than reversing the rally. China has made clear that deeper capital markets are central to its growth strategy; part of that is the upcoming revamp of the Shanghai benchmark and the launch of a Nasdaq-style startup index called the STAR Market.

4/DRUM ROLL FOR PMIS
PMI data took a bit of a backseat lately -- essentially Q2 figures were dismissed as reflecting, first, the activity collapse sparked by lockdowns and then, a rebound as restrictions lifted. But upcoming July releases will draw attention as investors seek clues on the outlook.
China's manufacturing PMI is already back above 50 -- the line dividing contraction from expansion -- and the euro zone is not far behind. Any signs of recovery taking hold will boost investor sentiment. 
Then again, unease could follow as investors fret that the fiscal and monetary life support of the past few months could start to be unwound.

Emerging-market policymakers have been busily slashing interest rates to heal economies devastated by the coronavirus. With central bank meetings due in some developing economies, expect more cutting. First -- Hungary. It's expected to trim rates by 0.15 basis points on Tuesday after a surprise June cut. 
Slowing inflation may also leave room for South Africa to trim its benchmark rate on Thursday. The same day, Turkey must square its rising inflation with industrial production and retail sales data that show some recovery, but not to pre-COVID-19 levels. Odds are it will keep rates unchanged. 
Russia rounds off the grand slam on Friday with central bank chief Elvira Nabullina expected to follow though on her signal for more rate cuts.

182,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 08:29AM ET</span>",'The stakes couldn't be higher': EU recovery plan summit under way,"By Marine Strauss and John Chalmers
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders met on Friday for tense summit talks on a multi-billion-euro plan to breathe life into their economies, their first face-to-face meeting since the coronavirus pandemic plunged the bloc into its latest crisis.
The 27 leaders, all masked up, greeted each other with elbow bumps rather than their customary cheek kisses and handshakes, and there were birthday gifts for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa.
But their display of bonhomie came after weeks of cross-continent quarrelling over the scale and scope of a joint rescue fund. As Merkel went into the talks, due to last two days, she warned that a deal was far from certain.
""I must say that the differences are still very, very big,"" she said. ""I expect very, very difficult negotiations.""
Dutch opposition and a threat of a Hungarian veto weigh on the chances for a deal on the EU's 2021-27 budget, envisaged at slightly above 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion), and an attached new recovery fund worth 750 billion euros, meant to help rebuild southern economies most affected by the crisis.
The 27 EU heads gathered in a room in the Brussels EU headquarters equipped with hand sanitisers and disinfected headsets. Unusually, as a health precaution, there were no journalists in the building. 
Officials said the summit could drag into Sunday if an agreement remains elusive. Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel told Reuters he had brought an extra set of clothes just in case.
""THE WORLD IS WATCHING"" 
With EU economies in free fall, and immediate relief measures such as short-time work schemes running out this summer, the spectre of an autumn of deep economic malaise and discontent is raising its head.
The EU is already struggling with the protracted saga of Brexit and bruised by past crises, from the financial meltdown of 2008 onwards to migration feuds.
Another economic shock could expose it to more eurosceptic, nationalist and protectionist forces, and weaken its standing against China, the United States or Russia.
""The stakes couldn't be higher,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said before the meeting began. ""The whole world is watching us, (to see) whether Europe is able to stand up united and to overcome this corona-related crisis strongly.""
After months of feuds over medicines, medical gear, border closures and money, the EU has already agreed a half-a-trillion-euro scheme to cushion the first hit of the coronavirus crisis, and narrowed some differences over how to finance kick-starting economic growth over the long term.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte is the main holdout among a thrifty camp of northern, wealthy countries demanding a smaller overall package, economic reforms as a condition for funds, an expanded vetting process for granting aid, and keeping rebates for net payers to the bloc's joint coffers. 
Countries on the Mediterranean want the recovery financing to come as free grants rather than repayable loans, to prevent their hard-hit economies further bloating already high levels of debt. 
""The big picture is that we are faced with the biggest economic depression since World War Two,"" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said. ""Maybe some compromises will be necessary, but we need ... an ambitious solution because our citizens expect nothing less from us.""
However, Hungary has threatened to veto the whole package over a proposed mechanism to freeze payouts for countries undercutting democratic values. 

Among other sticking points are when to make the recovery money available and for how long; how to repay debt to be acquired by the bloc's executive European Commission to collect these extra funds; and how much should be channelled to green projects that help the EU to meet its emissions targets. ($1 = 0.8787 euros)

""We are seeing activity return. We are beginning to see this recovery,"" Bailey said during a webinar organised by the central bank.
There were signs of activity returning ""quite strongly"" in the housing market and in new car sales, but not in hospitality and entertainment, which employ large numbers of people, many of them on low pay, he said.
There was a ""very big question"" about how cautious people would be about returning to life as before the crisis and there were also risks of a second wave of COVID-19, or localised outbreaks, Bailey said. 
Furthermore, the BoE did not know how much long-term damage the economy would suffer as a result of companies failing.
""We don't yet know the full story of this,"" he said, in response to a question about whether he shared the view of BoE Chief Economist Andy Haldane that the economy looked like it would have a swift V-shaped recovery.
Earlier this week, Britain's budget forecasters said the economy could shrink by more than 14% this year if there is lasting damage from the coronavirus.

The plan, which anticipates vast losses in the financial system, has been undermined by objections from Lebanon's ruling elite, obstructing IMF talks aimed at rescuing the country from a financial meltdown.
Prime Minister Hassan Diab's government had approved the plan, which would lead to losses of 241 trillion Lebanese pounds in the financial system, or $68.9 billion at the exchange rate applied by the plan, as the basis for talks with the IMF.
The IMF said the losses appeared to be about the right order of magnitude.
But a parliamentary fact-finding committee, backed by all Lebanon's main parties, objected to the approach taken in the plan. Applying different assumptions, it came up with losses between a quarter and half that amount.
""Lazard will come possibly next week to see if they can adjust the government plan and work on a compromise acceptable to the IMF. They will do any adjustment based on the government plan,"" one of the sources said.
The second source said the aim of the Lazard visit is ""how we can try to adjust the government plan to see if we can come up with something workable for the IMF and for the Lebanese counterparts"".
Lazard declined to comment.
Lebanon's legal adviser, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, is also visiting the country, the sources said.
The IMF warned Lebanon on Monday that attempts to lower losses from the financial crisis could only delay recovery.
Alain Bifani, a senior member of Lebanon's negotiating team with the IMF, resigned as finance ministry director general last month, saying vested interests were undermining the government plan.

Anyone will now be able to use public transport, Johnson said in a televised press conference on Friday, marking a change from guidance to avoid it where possible. And from August 1, he said employers will have “more discretion” on bringing staff working from home back into offices.
With the economy shrinking a fifth in the three months through April, Johnson and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak are trying to revive economic activity and stave off an expected wave of job cuts as the government tapers support for businesses and continues to ease a lockdown that began on March 23.
But the prime minister’s advice on Friday puts him at odds with Patrick Vallance, his chief scientific adviser, who told Parliament’s Science and Technology Committee on Thursday that he could see “absolutely no reason” to change guidance for people to work from home if they can.
“We’re still at a time when distancing measures are important, and of the various distancing measures, working from home, for many companies, remains a perfectly good option because it’s easy to do,” said Vallance, who heads up the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. “A number of companies think actually it’s not detrimental to productivity.”
Ministers are responding to concerns that shops and restaurants in city centers will struggle to survive if people who work in the offices around them continue to work from home. Vallance himself acknowledged that the government also has economic considerations to bear in mind as he sought to distance himself and his committee from policy decisions.
“What we’re doing is laying out scientific reasons behind options from which people can choose,” Vallance said. “Overlaying that with economic and other considerations is the job of government.”"

189,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 06:38AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday, July 17th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The U.S. shatters its record for daily new cases of Covid-19. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock slumps after warning of a sharp slowdown in subscriber growth in the second half of the year. China's stock bubble is quickly deflating while the U.S. is dreaming up ever more ways to punish it. And the euro hits a four-month high as EU leaders meet to discuss their big recovery fund plan. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, July 17th. 
1. New record for virus cases
The U.S. shattered its record for the number of new infections of Covid-19, with 77,300 recorded on Thursday. That took the total number of infections above 3.5 million in the U.S.
Covid-19-related deaths rose to an estimated 924, their highest since early June.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott said, however, that “there is no shutdown coming.”
Further afield, the number of cases in Brazil passed 2 million, while India’s topped 1 million. Both figures are likely under-reported due to less-than-comprehensive testing in those countries.
2. The froth comes off Chinese stocks
The bubble in Chinese stocks could be over already. Chinese markets stabilized on Friday but the main indices all ended the week with losses of between 4% and 5%.
The move follows a change in signalling by state-owned media and banks this week that quickly reversed some of the more exuberant buying seen in previous weeks by retail investors.
The news comes against the backdrop of more negative briefing by U.S. officials with regard to China. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that administration officials are discussing banning travel by China’s Communist Party members and their families to the U.S., while other reports this week have mooted a ban on short-form video service TikTok over data integrity concerns.
3. Stocks set to open higher; Michigan consumer sentiment due
U.S. stocks are set to open mostly higher to end the week on bargain-hunting after weak labor market data on Thursday knocked the main indices down by over half a percent.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 78 points or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 1.0%
A relatively light day for earnings is set to be dominated by asset manager Blackrock (NYSE:BLK),  which reported a 22% gain in per share earnings for the second quarter, somewhat better than expected.
The data calendar highlight is Michigan consumer sentiment at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), along with June data for housing starts and building permits, both at 8:30 AM ET.
4. Euro hits four-month high as EU leaders meet
European Union leaders are meeting in person for the first time since the pandemic erupted to discuss the bloc’s plans for a 750 billion-euro recovery fund that would mark the biggest step yet toward a centralized fiscal policy and explicit transfers from richer countries to poorer ones.
The Brussels summit is unlikely to reach a formal agreement on the European Commission’s plan, despite strong backing from Germany and France, traditionally the most influential members of the bloc.
Resistance to a proposal for up to 500 billion euros in fiscal transfers is being led by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who said on his arrival at the summit that he sees the chance of a deal today at less than 50%.
The euro nonetheless advanced to its highest in over four months before retracing slightly to trade at $1.1413, up 0.3% on the day.
5. Netflix stock slumps after growth warning
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock is set for a rocky ride after the company warned of a sharp slowdown in subscriber growth over the rest of the year.
The world’s biggest streaming company added another 10 million subscribers in the second quarter, living up to expectations that it would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of lockdowns across the globe. However, it expects only 2.5 million new users in the third quarter – half of what Wall Street had been hoping for.
At the same time, it also raised Ted Sarandos, the head of its Hollywood operations, to be co-chief executive alongside Reed Hastings.
Netflix stock was quoted down 7.5% in premarket trade, paring losses of over 15% at one point in after-hours trade on Thursday.

194,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 04:10AM ET</span>","ECB survey points to shallower recession, stronger rebound","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The euro zone economy may contract less this year than the European Central Bank had forecast and its recovery could also be quicker, the bank's Survey of Professional Forecasters showed on Friday.
The quarterly survey sees the economy shrinking by 8.3% this year, a downgrade from its May projection for a 5.5% drop but a more benign outcome than the ECB staff's own estimate for an 8.7% drop. For next year, growth is seen at 5.7%, above the ECB's staff's 5.2% estimate in June.
Although the euro zone suffered its biggest recession in generations, recent data suggest the economy bottomed out in April or May and a recovery is now underway, even if it is bound to be choppy, uneven and prone to setbacks.
The survey was also more optimistic about inflation as it sees 2020 price growth at 0.4% against the ECB's 0.3% projection while inflation in 2021 is seen at 1% as against the ECB's 0.8% prediction.

Growth projections for 2025, deemed as the ""longer-term"", were left unchanged at 1.4% but the longer-term inflation forecast was cut to 1.6% from 1.7%, short of the ECB's target for inflation at just below 2%.

Thirty-four traders and analysts out of 36 participants in the snap survey this week predicted no change to the one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR)  or the five-year tenor .
The remaining two expected a marginal reduction of five basis points (bps) in both tenors.
The one-year LPR is now 3.85% after two cuts this year, while the five-year rate is at 4.65%.
The overwhelmingly strong expectations for a steady fixing came as the People's Bank of China (PBOC) kept borrowing costs on the medium-term lending facility (MLF) unchanged this week.
The MLF is one of the PBOC's main tools in managing longer-term liquidity in the banking system, and serves as a guide for the LPR. The interest rate on one-year MLF loans has been kept steady for three months.
Data on Thursday showed China's economy grew 3.2% in the second-quarter from a year earlier, faster than the 2.5% expected by analysts, as lockdown measures ended and policymakers ramped up stimulus after a record, virus-induced contraction early in the year.
But it was still the smallest expansion on record, and analysts said unexpected weakness in domestic consumption underscored the need for further support to keep the recovery on track.
Analysts say policymakers, encouraged by signs of momentum, are now likely to shift away from broader-based emergency measures to more specific schemes to help areas of the economy that are still struggling.
""For the central bank, this implies a much lower probability of cutting RRR (banks' reserve requirements) or interest rates in the near future,"" analysts at BofA said in a note to clients on Friday, saying they do not expect the LPR to be lowered again before the end of 2021.
Analysts said policymakers are also wary that overly aggressive easing could spur speculative activity.
""The authorities may turn their eyes to regulatory tightening with regard to credit that been illicitly channelled into the stock market and the real estate sector,"" said Jacqueline Rong, senior China economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) in Beijing.
The LPR is a lending reference rate set monthly by 18 banks. 

All 36 responses in the survey were collected from selected participants on a private messaging platform.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese government is facing potentially damaging blowback after excluding Tokyo residents from a multibillion dollar campaign aimed at reviving domestic tourism, even as the capital on Friday reported a record number of new COVID-19 cases.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's $16 billion ""Go To"" tourism campaign was intended to promote travel across the country, but officials agreed on Thursday to exclude Tokyo because of the resurgence in infections there.
Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike reported 293 new cases on Friday, a fresh daily record after the city recorded 286 cases a day earlier. 
Abe has borne the brunt of the negative reaction to Tokyo's exclusion from the travel subsidy programme, adding to growing criticisms of his handling of the crisis that analysts said could erode his support. 
""What makes you think that business trips or commuting won't spread the coronavirus? Do you think it's fair to exclude Tokyoites from a campaign that's using taxpayers money?"" said opposition lawmaker Ren Ho on Friday morning in a tweet addressed to Abe.
The hashtag #TokyoExcluded was trending on Twitter on Friday, amassing almost 100,000 tweets.
Tourism Minister Kazuyoshi Akaba said the decision to exclude Tokyo residents from receiving a 50% government subsidy for domestic trips was ""heart-breaking."" The subsidy, which kicks in from July 22, will also not be available for anybody travelling to Tokyo.
""The decision was made comprehensively by the government with input from experts,"" Akaba told a news conference.
Some critics have said the entire tourism campaign, which also includes subsidies for dining in restaurants and shopping expeditions, should be scrapped given the risk of spreading the coronavirus. 
""Originally, the travel campaign was premised on the pandemic having been contained, but they (the Abe government) tried to push it through anyway. They excluded Tokyo, but cases are increasing nationally,"" said Tomoaki Iwai, political science professor at Nihon University.
""Voters feel that the prime minister's office is not making appropriate policy,"" creating a feeling of mistrust, Iwai added. 
Private credit research firm Teikoku Databank said coronavirus-related bankruptcies reached 350 nationwide as of Friday, with hotels and eateries accounting for about 30% of them. Tokyo's exclusion from the tourism campaign raised concerns about further bankruptcies there, it added.
Steven Reed, professor emeritus at Chuo University, said the last minute change in policy to exclude Tokyo ""adds to the number of examples of Abe's incompetence in governing.""
Abe's perceived missteps in his handling of the pandemic have included a much derided decision to distribute two cloth masks to each household and a last minute change to a household cash handout programme.
""He is certainly not leading in any way like he was before,"" Reed said, although he acknowledged the impact on Abe's support was hard to predict given voters routinely cite a lack of a viable alternative.
Yasutoshi Nishimura, the economic revival minister who is tasked with leading coronavirus containment efforts, last week said Japan had successfully contained the virus without a harsh economic lockdown. In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, Nishimura cited contact tracing efforts that helped quash transmission clusters.
Japan has reported a total of around 23,000 cases, including nearly 1,000 deaths.
Top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said Tokyo could be still be included in the travel subsidy programme if infection numbers recede, but also cautioned its exclusion from the dining out subsidies and others was ""under consideration"".
Data out this week underscored the plight of the domestic tourism industry, showing just 4 million international visitors in the first half of the year, a tenth of the government's full-year target of 40 million.

The figures underscore just how much damage the coronavirus and measures to contain the outbreak have done to the world's third-largest economy, which is struggling with its worst postwar recession.
The diffusion index - a gauge of companies' demand for funds at commercial banks - hit +59 in July, surging from +14 three months ago, according to a Bank of Japan (BOJ) quarterly survey.
It was the highest level since the BOJ began compiling the data in 2000.
Demand for loans from manufacturers and non-manufacturers of all sizes at commercial banks surged, as companies sought to meet immediate funding needs and build up cash reserves as a precaution, the survey showed.
By contrast, an index gauging households' demand for loans at commercial banks slumped to a record low of -24 from -7 three months ago, as lockdown measures keeping citizens at home hit consumption, according to the survey.

The government has deployed massive stimulus packages to cushion the blow of the coronavirus on the economy, while the BOJ has eased monetary policy twice this year to pump money into cash-strapped small firms.

199,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 08:11PM ET</span>","COVID-19, electric vehicles to reshape Thailand’s auto industry","By Chayut Setboonsarng
BANGKOK (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating the remaking of Thailand's automotive industry, the backbone of Southeast Asia's auto sector, as factory shutdowns compound a shift toward electric vehicles.
Thailand's auto-related businesses, which employ 900,000, are reopening after months of coronavirus shutdowns, promising relief for many laid-off workers.
But there's a catch: Thailand's shift toward electric vehicles (EVs) could pummel the local auto industry because it is dominated by hundreds of parts makers, while EVs require just 10% to 20% as many of parts as internal-combustion vehicles.
With an estimated one-third of a million jobs at risk, Thai auto-parts makers are scrambling into industries like medical equipment, a trend likely to keep reshaping Southeast Asia's second-largest economy after the pandemic passes.
""We are all worried ... this is a sunset industry,"" said Kasem Tiankanon, manager at Siam Filter Products Ltd.
The Bangkok-based company has avoided laying off any of its hundreds of workers by offsetting the drop in orders from automakers with an increase in replacement parts. The company is looking to branch out into making filters for industrial and medical use and is developing a new kind of protective mask. 
""We cannot just stay in the auto business,"" Kasem said. ""If you don't adjust, you'll die.""
Others moved to packaging and aviation. 
“It’s a pivot to industries that use the same processes because there is already expertise in machining,” said Sompol Tanadumrongsak, head of the Thai Auto-Parts Manufacturers Association. 
The coronavirus damage to car demand will crush Thailand's output by almost half to 1.14 million vehicles this year, research firm IHS Markit forecasts.
Parts makers, which account for some 80% of the country's auto-industry workers, have laid off 20,000, a number that could hit 100,000 by year end, said Manit Promkareekul, president of the Automobile Labour Congress of Thailand. 
EV prospects are brighter. 
Global sales will rise 6% this year to 2.3 million vehicles before exploding to 45 million by 2030, the International Energy Agency forecasts. 
STEERING TO ELECTRIC
Even before the new coronavirus struck, Thailand's parts makers were starting to shift gears as the global car industry moves toward EVs, spurred by the likes of Elon Musk's Tesla Inc. (O:TSLA). 
The government in March targeted EVs at 30% of production, or 750,000 vehicles, by 2030, initially for domestic use in a bid to curb pollution. 
Truck-chassis maker Sammitr Group last month received approval for a $170 million project to make 30,000 battery-power vehicles a year in a joint venture with a Chinese company.
In 2018 Honda Motor Co (T:7267) and Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) received approval for investments worth a combined $888 million to produce hybrid electric vehicles and batteries.
To be sure, Thailand faces competition from other countries in gaining factories for the expected EV boom. Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) last year announced a $2 billion EV investment in Indonesia.
But even if Thailand attracts more EV production, 800 auto-parts companies and more than 325,000 jobs could be at risk because an EV uses 1,500 to 3,000 parts, versus 30,000 in a traditional gasoline vehicle, said Kiriya Kulkolkarn at Thammasat University.
CALLS FOR GOVERNMENT HELP
Great Wall Motor Co, (SS:601633) China’s top pickup truck maker, took over two General Motors Co (N:GM) plants in Thailand in February to make sport-utility vehicles and pickups - but held back from EV production.
Great Wall would need more support from the government to produce EVs, vice president Steven Wang told Reuters.
EV incentives from Thailand's Board of Investment have expired, and now the board is exploring new measures to attract investors, said secretary-general Duangjai Asawachintachit.
What is needed to ensure Thailand's competitiveness are steps to provide clarity to investors and customers, said Kiranee Tammapiban-udom of Maverick Consulting Group.

""The industry is approaching an inflection point,"" she said. ""It will be left behind if policies do not accommodate EV manufacturing, its ecosystem and consumption.""

Economists at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). say policy makers may signal in August that interest rates could turn negative, while BofA Global Research expects them to cut the benchmark rate to zero from 0.1% as unemployment worsens and the inflation outlook weakens.
The Royal Bank of Canada says the central bank could be forced to take borrowing costs negative as early as November.
“The end of the year has the potential to become a perfect storm for the U.K. when risks of rising virus cases and the phasing out of labor market support coincide while Brexit becomes a tangible event,” RBC analysts including Peter Schaffrik and Cathal Kennedy said in a note. “The BOE will look for further stimulus measures and markets are likely to anticipate this.”
Bets on the BOE easing policy further are already picking up, with investors pricing in sub-zero rates by next spring. Money markets are pricing in a cut to zero in February.
Interest-rate futures tied to three-month sterling Libor -- the rate banks can borrow from each other -- are trading above 100, hinting at negative rates by September 2021. This funding rate is also below the BOE’s benchmark, a move that often precedes a rate cut.
The research follows a week of dim economic data, and an acknowledgment from policy maker Silvana Tenreyro on Wednesday that while activity will pick up from its historic, lockdown-induced plunge, it could then hit a ceiling. Businesses are already reeling and face additional burdens with Britain’s final split with the European Union at the end of the year.
Economists expect another 50 billion pounds ($63 billion) of bond purchases by the end of the year. There are signs that even that might not be enough.
While the labor market is holding up for now -- with more than 9 million employees being kept in employment on government wage subsidies -- the program will wind down by October. The country’s fiscal watchdog said this week that joblessness is likely to spike to the highest since Margaret Thatcher was prime minister.
Officials will provide updated forecasts for growth and inflation alongside their policy decision on Aug. 6. They may revise down their estimate for the so-called lower bound on bank rate to minus 0.5% in August, according to Goldman economist Adrian Paul.
Policy makers won’t push the benchmark that low “unless either fiscal stimulus is withdrawn prematurely, or a second adverse shock derails the post-virus recovery,” Paul said. “The fourth quarter is likely to be crucial.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell below 3% for the first time in records going back nearly 50 years this week, according to data released by  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) on Thursday.
The 30-year mortgage rate fell to an average of 2.98% with an average 0.7 point, from 3.03% in the prior week. Prior to this week, such rates had not fallen below 3% since Freddie Mac began its mortgage market survey in 1971.
Rates for 15-year fixed mortgages fell to an average of 2.48% with an average 0.7 point, from 2.51% in the prior week. On the other hand, five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages rose to an average of 3.06% with an average 0.3 point, from 3.02% in the previous week.
The historic decline in mortgage rates reflects an investor stampede into perceived safe havens such as U.S. Treasuries, which are now trading near all-time lows. At the same time, the Federal Reserve has signaled that it will continue its attempts to keep rates low by purchasing Treasuries and other bonds, a tactic known as quantitative easing.
""You're seeing unprecedented policy support and it's filtering down to the mortgage market,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group.
The steep fall in mortgage rates will likely spur increased consumer spending as homeowners refinance, providing another stimulus for the economy, Paulsen said.
""You're likely to see more improvements in retail spending numbers and auto loan rates the lower interest rates go,"" he said.
Underscoring an expected increase in refinance demand in the short term, Fannie Mae estimated in a report earlier this week that ""nearly 60 percent of all outstanding loan balances have at least a half-percentage point incentive to refinance.""
Low mortgage rates are also spurring demand from potential home buyers, said Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac.
Overall, real estate listing firm Zillow expects that U.S. home prices will fall less than 1.7% in 2020 despite the steep slowdown in the economy, due in part to the positive effect of lower interest rates.
The S&P 500 Homebuilding Index <.SPLRHOME>, which includes  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN), D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), and PulteGroup Inc (N:PHM), gained 2.4% Thursday. The index is up nearly 9% year to date, compared with a less than 1% decline in the broad S&P 500 as a whole.

Although the program was fully launched July 6, the Fed only started buying loans on Wednesday, so the disclosure captures just one day of purchases. Banks that make eligible loans to small- and mid-size businesses are able to sell 95% of each loan to the Fed. Loans can range in size from $250,000 to $300 million for an expansion of existing credit.
Lenders and borrowers alike have raised questions about takeup in the program, citing the complexity of the loan terms. Fed officials have said low use of the program may be a sign that companies are able to access the capital they need, rather than flag a shortcoming of the facility.

""This is not the time to think about liftoff or normalization,"" Williams said during an interview with Yahoo Finance. 
The virus has created an ""enormous amount of uncertainty"" and even if the U.S. economy begins to recover in the second half of 2020, it may take some time for the economy to come out of a ""very deep hole."" 
""We have a long ways to go to get back to full strength,"" Williams said. 
The rebound is starting to stall in states where the number of coronavirus cases is rising, a trend that is causing people to cut down on trips to restaurants and other activities, Williams said. 
Fiscal stimulus delivered to households and businesses in the form of cash transfers or grants have been effective at supporting workers and small businesses, Williams said.
Williams reiterated the Fed's goal of hitting its 2% inflation target, but said it could be challenging at a time when rates are low. 
""The goal here is we want inflation to be anchored at 2%,"" Williams said.
""That's been harder to do than to say and I would argue that much of that is because of this issue of the lower bound on interest rates and the limited ability in a global situation of very low interest rates to really provide accommodation and stimulus as needed."" 
Asked about the potential use of yield curve control to target rates at specific maturities, Williams said it would best be used in situations where forward guidance wasn't being as effective as Fed officials would like.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's executive order ending Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law effectively ends the territory's separate customs treatment from China - but the immediate impact on trade is likely to be limited, trade law experts say. 
Trump's order https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidents-executive-order-hong-kong-normalization, issued late on Tuesday to punish China over a new national security law imposed on Hong Kong, does not explicitly mention tariffs nor Hong Kong's separate customs status.
Instead, it suspends a 1992 law granting Hong Kong special economic status, referencing a statute governing country-of-origin labeling for imported goods. 
The net effect is to rescind Hong Kong's status as a separate customs territory, said Georgetown University law professor Jennifer Hillman, a former World Trade Organization appellate judge.
That means goods from Hong Kong will now be considered as being from China for duty purposes, Hillman and other Washington trade lawyers said. 
As Hong Kong shifted from being a manufacturing center to a trading and finance hub, its goods exports to the United States have fallen, to only $4.7 billion in 2019. The largest category, according to U.S. Census Bureau data https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/product/enduse/imports/c5820.html, was $2.2 billion worth of returned goods initially exported from the United States. 
The next largest categories were gem diamonds at $388 million, jewelry at $317 million and other gemstones at $247 million.
""It's not going to be a devastating blow to Hong Kong's economy,"" said Claire Reade, senior counsel with Arnold and Porter in Washington. She added that much of Hong Kong's exports had shifted to services.
The change also could leave many U.S. tariffs unchanged. Before the Trump administration's trade war with China, goods from both Hong Kong and China had long been subject to duties at the U.S. Most Favored Nation rate, which WTO data show averaged 3.3% last year.
A ""Section 301"" list subjected many Chinese consumer goods, including diamonds and jewelry, to a 15% U.S. tariff in September 2019, reduced in February to 7.5% as a result of the Phase 1 trade deal with China.
The Trump order means that gems and jewelry from Hong Kong - among the biggest imports from the territory - along with some other products, are now subject to the same duties.
Several trade lawyers said they were still examining the implications of the order on Thursday, and noted that the U.S. Trade Representative's Office has the ability to grant exclusions from the Section 301 tariffs on Chinese goods. A USTR spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
Trump's order does not immediately affect the United States' $30 billion to $40 billion in annual exports https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/product/enduse/exports/c5820.html to Hong Kong, which are largely tariff-free, nor Hong Kong's independent membership in the WTO. However China's threatened retaliation could dampen sales of U.S. goods there in the future, trade experts say. 

The port and trade hub is consistently the source of the largest U.S. bilateral trade surplus - $26 billion in 2019 - with top U.S. export categories including semiconductors, diamonds, jewelry, beef and aircraft engines and parts.

(Reuters) - There's little reason for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates until inflation rises above the Fed's 2% target, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said on Thursday, noting that he expects low inflation to be a problem for the next few years.
Evans forecast U.S. unemployment to fall only to 6.5% by the end of next year, well above the 4.5% most Fed policymakers see as consistent with full employment. 
Even if unemployment falls below 4%, experience has shown that inflation won't respond by surging, Evans said. 
""I am hard pressed to think of reasons why we would need to move away from accommodative monetary policy unless inflation was well above 2% for an extended period of time, and the economy was just very different from what we are seeing right now,"" he said in a virtual event held by the Global Interdependence Center. ""That doesn’t seem to be very likely.""
The Fed has slashed interest rates to near zero and bought trillions of dollars of bonds to shore up financial and credit markets during the COVID-19 crisis. Monetary policy, he said, needs to be positioned to battle downside risks to the economy, such as those posed by a resurgence in infections across the country. Central to that, he said, is getting across the message that the Fed will stay accommodative even as the unemployment rate drops, as long as inflation doesn't careen out of control. 

""I think it's very important that we get inflation up to 2%; I'm looking for that to be a real problem over the next few years,"" he said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said on Thursday that he had brought a spare shirt to Brussels for the upcoming European Union summit just in case an extra day is needed to clinch a deal on a multi-billion-euro recovery fund for the bloc's economies.
Xavier Bettel said it was critical for the EU's 27 member states to demonstrate solidarity when they gather for their two-day meeting on Friday because if one country collapses due to the damage from the coronavirus crisis it will affect them all.
""Solidarity is in the interest of all of us,"" Bettel told Reuters in an interview. ""If Italy or Spain collapses because they have an economic crisis and afterwards a social crisis it's not in the interests of all the other countries.""
The EU leaders will meet face-to-face for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic triggered lockdowns across Europe and plunged the continent into its deepest-ever recession.
Along with talks over the EU's next seven-year budget, they will also negotiate over a recovery fund of grants and loans worth 750 billion euros ($854 billion) that is designed primarily to prop up southern countries hardest hit by the crisis.
Bettel said he hoped that leaders met in person rather than by video conference, to aid in overcoming differences that have so far stood in the way of an agreement.
The Netherlands leads a group of wealthy northern states that favour loans over grants and wants to be able to veto applications for aid. 
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has also threatened to block an agreement over a mechanism to freeze funds for states undercutting the rule of law.
Bettel said that if the leaders fail to reach an accord it would be wrong to blame the Netherlands, and while rule of law principles must be discussed at the summit, countries that need recovery funds should not be held hostage to the issue.
Bettel said he would be delighted if the leaders could agree on the fund as a birthday present for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who will turn 66 on Friday.

However, he said he was doubtful an accord could come so quickly and - recalling how at a previous summit that went on longer than planned he had to wash a shirt in his bathroom - he said he had brought clothes for three days, just in case.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's top central banker has urged the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to issue hundreds of billions of dollars of liquidity to its 189 member countries through a general allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) despite U.S. objections.
Yi Gang, governor of the People's Bank of China, wrote in an opinion piece https://www.ft.com/content/e7efef20-3960-46e7-922b-112dba8f2def in the Financial Times that an issuance of SDRs - the IMF's internal monetary unit - is needed to help countries to contend with the COVID-19 pandemic.
""A general allocation of SDRs, which are sometimes called 'liquid gold' and can be created with the stroke of a pen, is the missing piece in (the) IMF's crisis response,"" Yi wrote.
The move, akin to a central bank printing new money, was last deployed in 2009, when the IMF issued $250 billion of SDRs to its members to ease the global financial crisis.
While such a move has the backing of prominent economists, many finance ministers and some former government leaders, its biggest opponent - the U.S. Treasury - holds veto power over major decisions at the IMF.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has opposed SDR issuance because it would provide all countries with added liquidity, arguing that most of the money would go to wealthier G20 countries that do not need it.
U.S. opposition to additional resources for China and Iran also have been viewed as a factor in preventing a new SDR allocation. 
Yi's call to revisit the SDR issue comes as G20 finance ministers and central bank governors prepare to meet by videoconference to discuss the crisis response and other global finance issues. The meeting is being organized by G20 chair Saudi Arabia.

Yi said that SDR allocation could be tailored to provide more support to developing countries that inadequately covered by existing financial safety nets or currency swap arrangements, with less funds going to richer countries.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 02:20PM ET</span>",Rejected Bridgewater trade secrets claim started as a guess: ruling,"By Lawrence Delevingne
BOSTON (Reuters) - A senior Bridgewater Associates LP executive was only making a guess that former employees used trade secrets to compete against the world's largest hedge fund firm, according to an arbitration ruling made public on Thursday that rejected the firm's claim. 
The executive, co-chief investment officer Greg Jensen, admitted he was guessing when he helped initiate the claims against Lawrence Minicone and Zachary Squire after seeing the investor pitch book of their new hedge fund firm, Tekmerion Capital Management LP, according to the ruling, which was issued on Jan. 24 but whose details were only made public on Thursday in New York County Supreme Court.
""I don’t have any other evidence. I don’t need any other evidence,"" the arbitration panel in the case quoted Jensen as saying.
While the broad findings of the arbitration ruling were published on Monday, the panel's entire judgment provides new details that shed light on the inner workings of $138 billion asset manager Bridgewater, led by billionaire Ray Dalio.
The Westport, Connecticut-based firm is known for its corporate culture of ""radical transparency,"" where much of its internal processes are recorded and debated openly among employees, from investment decisions to personnel performance. 
Bridgewater created lists of people who were privy to the firm's secrets ""for purposes of the litigation,"" according to the ruling. The lists included people who were not employed at Bridgewater during the relevant period and excluded others who had access, the ruling states.
Jensen and representatives for Bridgewater did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
An attorney for Minicone and Squire, Aaron Zeisler, said in an emailed statement to Reuters that ""the fees and costs granted by the arbitration panel in its Final Award is the only matter that remains in dispute, and we look forward to pursuing their confirmation in court.""
Bridgewater has said in a court filing it ""continues to believe that the arbitrators were mistaken and that it proved its trade secret and contract claims."" 
Minicone and Squire, now in their mid-thirties, left Bridgewater in 2013. Following the expiration of their non-compete agreements, they co-founded New York-based Tekmerion in early 2017, which, like Bridgewater, makes market bets on global macroeconomic trends. That prompted Bridgewater to initiate trade secrets claims against the men later in 2017, resulting in arbitration. 
The court ruling was released with the permission of a New York state court judge as part of a bid by Tekmerion's founders to recover nearly $2 million in legal fees awarded to them by the arbitrators.
The arbitration ruling noted that news of Tekmerion’s start reached Bridgewater immediately, and had the attention of the firm’s top executives. Jensen forwarded an email about the launch to Dalio on Feb. 3, 2017, two days after Tekmerion's start. Dalio responded to Jensen’s email at 7:25 p.m., 15 minutes after receiving it, although the contents were not disclosed.
The ruling also notes that Bridgewater’s trade secrets claims were undercut by its own fortress-like computer security. The firm has strict limits on which employees can access its investment code and processes; personnel enter and exit through designated doors; and they are required to put cell phones and personal computers in digital access-blocking lockers.
The ruling said Bridgewater brought the claim against Minicone and Squire in ""bad faith."" It said Bridgewater ""filed its claims in reckless disregard of its own internal records, and in order to support its allegations of access to trade secrets, manufactured false evidence.""
Bridgewater said in a filing earlier this week that the marketing document, a so-called pitch deck, ""closely resembled"" its own and, based on that, engaged in its own investigation, which concluded that the former employees had ""misappropriated its trade secrets."" 
More broadly, it said the panel's ""overarching holding"" was that neither party proved their claims and therefore it should not have to pay their legal fees.

Tekmerion remains tiny by hedge fund standards, managing about $60 million today, according to a person familiar with the fund.

210,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 02:20PM ET</span>",Bank of Canada governor's low rate promise could spur housing speculators,"By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem's reassurance that interest rates will remain low for at least two years could unleash a wave of speculative demand in the country's hottest housing markets, realtors and mortgage brokers warned.
Canadian authorities are hoping a raft of stimulus measures and decade-low interest rates will spur credit growth and housing investment, helping offset the economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic and oil prices hovering near multi-year lows.
""If you've got a mortgage, or you're considering to make a major purchase ... you can be confident that interest rates will be low for a long time,"" Macklem told reporters after the central bank held rates steady on Wednesday.
That comment could boost housing demand in an economy with an unemployment rate close to the highest in decades and consumer insolvencies expected to spike in coming months, brokers said.
""In a country engaged in the most spectacular stimulus program ... the suggestion that everybody should run out and buy a house or a car is a bit much,"" said Ron Butler of Toronto-based Butler Mortgage. His office saw record inquiries this week even before Macklem's statement.
Macklem's comments also seemingly put the central bank at odds with the government's mortgage agency, which last month tightened mortgage insurance rules for riskier borrowers to help curtail ""excessive demand and unsustainable house price growth.""
Bank of Canada did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
STIMULUS BLURS ECONOMIC PICTURE
Evan Siddall, chief executive of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Agency, tweeted on Thursday that low rates and stricter underwriting can coexist.
""Surely you can reconcile the need for low rates to stimulate borrowing by people with strong credit characteristics with a policy that restrains excessive borrowing by those with weaker credit characteristics,"" he said.
However, unprecedented levels of government stimulus have made borrowers' true economic status less clear, Butler said.
Canadian home sales rebounded sharply in May and June following the weakest April on record, data from the Canadian Real Estate Association showed. In Toronto, Canada's biggest city, home prices jumped nearly 12% in June from a year earlier.
Government support - worth about C$230 billion ($170 billion), according to the Department of Finance - and loan deferrals by banks have bolstered home prices, and pushed expected declines toward the end of this year or early 2021, said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada.
""Then we will see the true health of household balance sheets,"" he said.
People buying properties now could find themselves with negative equity in their homes if those declines materialize, said Vancouver-based Oakwyn Realty agent Steve Saretsky. 
CMHC last month forecast home price declines of between 9% and 18% over the next 12 months.
""If you buy a home today, you have to be extremely confident in your work situation,"" Saretsky said. ""I don't think you have a free market when you have mortgage deferrals and unlimited quantitative easing and C$2,000 (unemployment) checks.""
John Pasalis, president of Realosophy Realty, said that while it is normal for central banks to encourage borrowing during economic downturns, Macklem's explicit message to take on mortgages is likely to encourage speculative buying. 

""When investors dominate the market, prices get inflated beyond where they should be,"" he said.

212,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>",Explainer: U.S. Congress readies $740 billion defense bill covering far more than bullets,"By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Defense Authorization Act, which sets policy for the U.S. Defense Department, is one of the only major bills to reliably pass Congress and be signed into law every year.
As lawmakers consider the $740 billion NDAA proposal for 2021, they are bracing for the possibility that President Donald Trump will veto what is usually viewed as a ""must-pass"" measure, over objections to renaming U.S. military facilities named after Confederate generals.
Here are a few things to watch for when debate begins next week:
SWAN SONG FOR SPENDING?
This year's NDAA could be the swan song for the constant expansion of the military budget, which has soared since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, except when reined in by mandatory spending caps.
Trump, with the help of the Republican-controlled Senate, has made boosting defense spending a top priority, using it to advance projects politically important to the president, including building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, deploying a new type of smaller nuclear bomb and creating a new branch of the military called the Space Force.
If Trump loses to former Vice President Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 election, or if Republicans lose control of the Senate, that could signal reduced spending in the coming years as Democrats look to boost funding for education, healthcare and other programs.
Regardless of the outcome of the Nov. 3 elections, the defense industry, companies including  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) and Raytheon Technologies Corp (N:RTX), are expecting lower or flat defense spending in the coming years after a run up in recent years.
HOW WILL THE U.S. CULTURE WARS INFLUENCE THE PROCESS?
The proposed House and Senate defense bills both include language that would rename U.S. military bases named after former leaders of the pro-slavery Confederacy. The proposals have the support of Democrats and many Republicans, as well as leaders of the military, one of the most racially diverse organizations in the United States.
Trump has vowed to veto any bill that includes such language. As he campaigns ahead of elections on Nov. 3, Trump has backed the continued display of Confederate symbols and criticized protesters, even downplaying police violence against Black people.
Some Democrats also want the 2021 NDAA to end a program that gives military equipment to police forces and to bar the deployment of troops against civilian protesters.
WHAT ABOUT U.S. TROOPS IN GERMANY?
A rare point of contention arose between Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress last month when he announced plans to withdraw some 10,000 of the 34,500 U.S. troops in Germany, a major center for American forces since World War Two.
Trump has accused Germany of not pulling its weight as part of the NATO alliance.

Some Republicans and Democrats criticized the plan, saying that the U.S.-German alliance helps to counter the global international influence of Russia and China. Groups of lawmakers from both the Democratic-controlled House and Republican-controlled Senate want to include in the NDAA a measure that would bar Trump from lowering troop levels until 180 days after Pentagon leaders certify to Congress that doing so would not harm the interests of the United States or its allies.

213,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 01:55PM ET</span>","Negative U.S. rate bets persist, but seen unlikely to happen","By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Negative U.S. interest rates could be the norm next year and all through to 2023 if fed funds futures are any indication. Or it could just be traders hedging their bets.
Fed funds futures have implied negative rates next year on-and-off since May, when the contracts priced them for the first time. They flipped back to show positive rates, but over the past month, futures contracts at different points have again signaled negative rates as early as spring 2021.
Futures are now betting interest rates could go below zero all the way to June 2023.
""We're sitting here with real economic turmoil and what the market is saying is that the risks could be bad enough that the Federal Reserve could be forced to take rates negative,"" said Stan Shipley, fixed income strategist, at Evercore ISI. 
On Thursday, fed funds futures [0#FF:], a gauge of where markets expect the Fed's benchmark overnight lending rate will be at different intervals, has priced in negative rates of about half a basis point in July 2021. 
That doesn't mean it will happen. Federal Reserve officials have so far uniformly rebuffed them, with the latest rejection coming on Tuesday as Fed Governor Lael Brainard said negative rates are not an attractive option for U.S. monetary policy.
Negative interest rates have been used in Europe and Japan as a further goad to lending by making it costly for banks to park funds with monetary authorities.
But negative rates also compress the margin financial institutions earn from lending and can have the effect of stopping them lending, eventually damaging the economy. 
""There can be few ideas more abhorrent to the traditional fixed income investor than that of negative interest rates,"" wrote Citi's global markets strategist Matt King and global chief economist Catherine Mann in a report, adding the mere suggestion that investors might need to pay to lend ""strikes at the heart of everything we thought we knew about finance."" 
The Fed slashed the fed funds rates to near zero in March and launched numerous programs to boost liquidity and stabilize financial markets. 
The fed funds market often misses the mark in accurately predicting where rates will be beyond the near term. In December 2018, the market was predicting a fed funds rate of nearly 3% a year later. By the time December rolled around, the rate was roughly half that after three rate cuts.
Still, pricing negative rates well into 2023 suggested investors are expecting a prolonged recession, dire enough that the Fed would consider setting rates below zero.
""People may be uncertain as to how long COVID will last so they're targeting the (zero) floor to break,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist, at TD Securities, adding that rates were being indicated as negative ""a little bit further out now.""
There are indications that the much-hoped for V-shaped recovery may not happen. Fed officials on Tuesday cautioned about a slower-than-expected rebound.
""All of a sudden, the global economic data flow isn't coming in with green shoots,"" said Dave Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Rosenberg Research.
FOR NOW, A TECHNICAL MOVE
In May, analysts said the pricing of negative rates may be a sign traders were hedging their positions.
UBS said at the time that the move was likely accounting-driven, with banks trying to protect against a negative rates scenario.
The same hedging process is likely underway again.
""It's a technical move,"" said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy, at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY). ""It's not nearly as deep as the last time when there was a lot of hedging related to the zero lower-bound.""
Futures contracts on the back end also have very little liquidity. The December 2021 contract has priced in a fed funds rate of minus 2 basis points, but there were just 21 contracts traded on Monday, said TD's Goldberg.
What could shake rates sentiment, however, still lies with the Fed.

""I would wait for a shift in the Fed's monetary stance in their speeches, that they are more inclined to adopt negative rates,"" Societe Generale's Rajappa said. ""But until then, I wouldn't read too much into the fed funds futures.""

Withdrawals during the month totaled 1.86 billion pesos ($83 million), more than twice the 921 million pesos withdrawn in June 2019, according to figures released Wednesday by pensions regulator Consar.
During the first half of this year, withdrawals of funds by Mexicans who lost their jobs totaled 8.57 billion pesos, also a record for the six-month period.
The Mexican economy is reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures intended to curb its spread, which paralyzed much of the economy over the past few months.
Mexico's social security institute IMSS reported over the weekend that more than 83,000 formal jobs disappeared in June, down from the nearly 345,000 lost in May.
Since March, the pandemic is blamed for the loss of over a million formal jobs.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said that in July Mexico will stop losing jobs. Still, analysts anticipate that the economy will contract sharply this year.

Pension funds in Mexico, also known as afores, managed savings of some 4.3 trillion pesos at the end of June, according to Consar data.

215,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>",Cresting 'first wave' of stimulus may be next hurdle for world markets,"By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - A growth spurt in the balance sheets of the world's biggest central banks has crested in recent weeks, drawing warnings from investors that any signs of backpedaling on stimulus will jolt financial markets and strangle economic recovery.
The U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, and Bank of Japan joined others in March with a wave of stimulus to stem damage from the coronavirus pandemic.
Their combined balance sheets grew by an estimated $5.3 trillion as they expanded quantitative easing programmes via asset purchases, which - hitherto restricted largely to government bonds - now include a wider remit, spanning equities to junk corporate debt.
But as markets have rebounded and economies reopen, that balance sheet surge is levelling off.
Reuters analysis found growth in the four central banks' balance sheets slowed for the second straight month in June, with some $852 billion added. That was less than half of what was added in April. (Graphic: Cresting wave: central bank balance sheets, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovajemrpa/Pasted%20image%201594859249547.png) 
""Now that market functioning has largely normalized, central banks are actually reducing their support measures,"" BofA rates strategist Ralf Preusser told clients.
Authorities are no longer in fire-fighting mode as they were during the March-April meltdown. Yet, the slowdown is significant. 
First, a resurgence of coronavirus infections https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B59S39E/index.html worldwide is forcing authorities to reimpose lockdowns, dashing hopes of swift economic recovery.
Second, emergency government schemes, such as worker furloughs and benefits supplements, are also due to expire. 
That's rekindled fears of a ""taper tantrum"", similar to the market panic which ensued in 2013 when the Fed hinted at unwinding stimulus. 
""The recovery is actually at risk from insufficient fiscal efforts, and central banks will turn more, not less, aggressive,"" Preusser added.
(Graphic: Bank of England's gilt holdings, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegpbmrmmvq/Pasted%20image%201594871378055.png) 
WARNING
Evidence of stimulus deceleration is widespread. The BOE has halved its rate of gilt purchases and cited some signs of economic recovery, while the Reserve Bank of Australia has not purchased any assets since early-May.
The BOJ this week effectively suggested a pause in monetary easing.
And at the ECB, weekly bond purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) fell to 17.5 billion euros last week, the slowest since its start in March.
Danske Bank chief strategist Piet Haines Christiansen estimates the ECB is buying at a rate of about 4 billion euros a day. At that pace, he reckons the ECB could hit the PEPP's 1.35 trillion-euro limit by next June.
But various ECB policymakers have indicated that limit may not be fully utilized. That would mean a substantial decline in purchases, Christiansen says.
""Markets do not appreciate that yet,"" he warned. ""Markets expect full PEPP implementation so if purchases are scaled back well below the 4 billion euros a day, we may see a reaction in markets."" 
It's not all bad news - bond markets were reassured on Thursday by ECB President Christine Lagarde who said the PEPP facility would be fully utilised.
Meanwhile, the Fed balance sheet shrinkage is mostly down to reduced demand for its swap and repo facilities as global dollar shortages eased.

""BENEFITS CLIFF""
The looming expiry of U.S. and European worker support schemes, however, remains a concern, said Jim Leaviss https://www.bondvigilantes.com/blog/2020/07/15/the-new-taper-tantrum-h2-outlook-2020/?utm_campaign=Bond%20Vigilantes%20English&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Eloqua, head of fixed income at M&G Investments.
""The second half (of 2020) will be all about the new taper tantrum,"" Leaviss added.
First up is the end-July expiration of a $600 weekly supplement for unemployed Americans -- dubbed the ""benefits cliff"" by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which sees this as one of the defining moments for markets this summer.
Asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) cited that cliff as a reason to cut U.S. equities https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/literature/whitepaper/bii-2020-midyear-outlook.pdf in favour of Europe, where a ground-breaking recovery fund is under debate to aid hardest-hit states. 
But worker furloughs start winding down across Europe too this autumn, including in Britain, Spain and Netherlands.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva warned https://blogs.imf.org/2020/07/15/the-next-phase-of-the-crisis-further-action-needed-for-a-resilient-recovery on Wednesday it was premature to start withdrawing safety nets, while Lagarde said the cliff needed monitoring. 
Ultimately though the prospect of market tantrums may be what deters authorities from hitting the brakes too hard. 
Daniel White, senior research and strategy manager at Canada Life Investments, said the sheer scale of stimulus meant some tapering was inevitable, but authorities would tread carefully. 
""The story of the past 15 years is that governments and central banks have become hostages (of markets),"" White said.
BofA predicts balance sheet expansion to resume too; its analysis shows every major central bank will end 2020 with a bigger balance sheet than now.

(Reuters) - The emergency lending facilities set up by the Federal Reserve helped to ease credit markets after they were disrupted by the pandemic, and relatively low usage of the programs is a sign that markets are functioning well, New York Fed president John Williams (NYSE:WMB) said Thursday. 
The central bank had to take an innovative approach when responding to markets to help keep credit flowing to households and businesses, reviving some programs used during the 2008 financial crisis but also establishing new ones, Williams said during a webinar. 
""The scale and reach of the response is an indication of the gravity and unique nature of the situation we are facing,"" Williams said. 
While some of the programs have not been heavily used, Williams said that is a positive sign because it means that credit remains available. 
""This is in fact a measure of success — the existence of the facilities, even in a backstop role, has helped boost confidence to the point where borrowers are able to access credit from the private market at affordable rates,"" he said. 
The Fed moved quickly to support the economy in March as the coronavirus spread across the globe by cutting interest rates to near zero and setting up a slew of emergency lending facilities. Asked about the Fed's plan for unwinding those programs, Williams said policymakers are more focused on the crisis. 
""I don't think today is the time to be focused on exit strategies, we're still in the middle of a very difficult situation,"" Williams said.

The Fed official also said disinflationary pressures are more dominant than inflationary pressures because of the pandemic, which has hampered economic activity.

Media companies are hard-pressed with cash flow concerns as they see a drop in advertising revenue since the coronavirus outbreak, forcing many to cut expenses.
Vox Media Chief Executive Officer Jim Bankoff said in the email a majority of those impacted by the layoff were employees furloughed in May and would receive health insurance and severance packages.
The publisher will bring back about 30% of the furloughed employees who chose not to take buyouts, Bankoff said, adding that it will reinstate full salaries of the remaining employees. 
""The only exceptions are me and my executive team, who will continue our reductions,"" the CEO wrote in the letter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global debt surged to a record $258 trillion in the first quarter of 2020 as economies around the world shut down to contain the coronavirus pandemic, and debt levels are continuing to rise, the Institute for International Finance said on Thursday in a report.
The IIF, which represents global banks and financial institutions, said the first-quarter debt-to-GDP ratio jumped by over 10 percentage points, the largest quarterly surge on record, to reach a record 331%.
While the rise in debt levels was well below average quarterly gains seen from 2015 to 2019, the pace of global debt build-up by governments, companies, financial institutions and households had accelerated since March, it said.
Overall gross debt issuance hit an ""eye-watering"" record of $12.5 trillion in the second quarter, compared with a quarterly average of $5.5 trillion in 2019, the IIF said. It noted that 60% of those issues came from governments.
""While increasing debt levels raise concerns about debt sustainability, over 92% of government debt is investment-grade,"" the report said.
Debt in mature markets topped 392% of GDP, up from 380% in 2019, with the rise in debt ratios outside the financial sector most pronounced in Canada, France, Norway and the United States. U.S. debt made up half of the total $185 trillion of debt in mature markets.
Debt-to-GDP ratios jumped to 230% in emerging markets in the first quarter from 220%, but the U.S. dollar value of debt fell by $700 million to $72.5 trillion, largely due to a depreciation in emerging market currencies against the U.S. dollar, the IIF said.
It said China's debt across all sectors was on track to hit 335% of GDP after increasing to 318% in the first quarter from 302%, the largest quarterly surge on record. About 60% of the debt build-up was due to non-financial corporates, it said.
The group said some $3.7 trillion of emerging market debt would come due through the end of 2020, and was set to rise to $4 trillion in 2021.

221,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",BOJ looks to big data for clues on pandemic-driven economic changes,"By Leika Kihara and Takahiko Wada
TOKYO (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic may have caused structural changes in Japan's economy and the way it affects inflation, requiring the Bank of Japan to tap more deeply into big data in making policy decisions, the central bank's top economist said on Thursday.
High-frequency and other unconventional data offer crucial, real-time information on rapid changes that a big shock like COVID-19 causes in the economy, said Kazushige Kamiyama, who heads the BOJ's research and statistics department.
While official consumer inflation data will remain the BOJ's key price gauge, the bank will look more carefully at a broader range of high-frequency and non-traditional data as the pandemic brings unpredictable shifts in the economy, he said.
""Extremely big shocks like COVID-19 could trigger structural changes in the economy,"" Kamiyama told Reuters.
""We need to avoid being too simplistic, and try to look at the economy with a more sophisticated approach,"" he said.
The world's third-largest economy is bracing for its worst postwar recession, hurt by coronavirus lockdown measures at home and overseas that have upended supply chains, kept businesses shut and depressed consumer spending.
Major central banks are increasingly tapping non-traditional data, such as credit card spending, foot and vehicle traffic, smartphone usage and even air pollution levels to capture real-time changes in their economies, in contrast to government data that come with months of delay.
The BOJ is seeking to catch up. Last year, Kamiyama set up a task force within his department to better incorporate findings from high-frequency data into the bank's economic analysis.
For example, global movements of car-loaded cargo ships and movement of people around factories offer clues on how much the pandemic hit Japanese exports and output, he said.
""In times of shock, uncertainty over the state of the economy and its outlook heightens. It's like driving without your lights on,"" Kamiyama said.
""That's when non-traditional data that gives us quick information, including high-frequency data, become really valuable,"" he said.
Big data may also help policymakers better understand how the pandemic could affect inflation and companies' price-setting behaviour, Kamiyama said.
""The pandemic has caused not just a slump in demand but changes in the supply side"" such as social distancing policies that force some retailers to raise prices to make up for higher costs, he said.
That means COVID-19 may not necessarily be deflationary, Kamiyama said.

""There's uncertainty on how the balance of demand and supply could change when economic activity picks up,"" he said. ""We need to use various data to check whether our hypothesis is valid.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's central bank will consider cutting interest rates next week, but it has already used much of its room to ease policy and foresees limits to what it can do in the future, Deputy Governor Alexei Zabotkin told Reuters. 
The central bank slashed its key rate by 100 basis points, the biggest cut in five years, to a record low of 4.5% at its last meeting. It was the third reduction this year as it copes with a contracting economy and low inflation. 
Although the bank sees a ""significant risk"" inflation will remain below its 4% target next year, Zabotkin said further policy easing is likely to be more gradual. The key rate was at 6.25% at the start of this year. 
""Most likely the pace of further cuts will be more gradual given that a significant part of the room for easing has already been used,"" he said. The central bank's board is due to meet on July 24 for its next key rate setting decision. 
With the Russian economy forecast to shrink by as much as 6% this year, the government plans to spend nearly 4 trillion roubles ($56 billion) to fight the economic fallout from coronavirus. 
The need for additional funds forced the finance ministry to temporary soften its fiscal rule to increase spending, the bulk of which will be secured via printing fresh state rouble OFZ bonds. 
The central bank, which in the past was at odds with the finance ministry over the pace of budget spending and the potential impact on its inflation goals, has praised the ministry's efforts. 
""This year, the budget policy comes in form of stimulus which substantially supports demand and curbs existing disinflation trends,"" Zabotkin said.

The central bank saw no threat from the finance ministry's plans to increase state debt, he said, but added it was important to return to the fiscal rule - and the spending ceilings therein - after the crisis is over in 2021-2022.

WARSAW/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU countries nudged towards an agreement on a mass stimulus scheme to kickstart economies hammered by the coronavirus but disagreements persisted over the scale and access to funds before Friday's summit.
The 27 national EU heads will meet face-to-face for the first time since COVID-19 pushed Europe into a sweeping lockdown. They will haggle over their next budget proposed at 1.074 trillion euros ($1.22 trillion) for 2021-27 and an attached recovery fund of 750 billion euros in grants and loans.
The Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Austria - the wealthy but thrifty net contributors to the bloc's joint coffers - want to lower the scale of funding, favour loans over grants for their southern peers hit harder by the pandemic and demand economic reforms as preconditions for accessing the money. 
Differences also linger over procedures to assess and approve, or reject, applications for handouts from the 750 billion new fund as well as framing conditions on respecting democratic values and fighting climate change to win aid. 
""Rationally speaking, a deal is possible, but summits are not always rational,"" said one senior EU diplomat ahead of the talks planned for Friday and Saturday.
""The only thing that the frugals have not entirely accepted is the grants and loans split... they want to reduce the amounts, as well as insist on issues of governance, rebates, the overall balance.""
European Council President Charles Michel, who will host the Brussels talks, has put forward a compromise plan that goes some way to assuaging the concerns of the frugal camp, weary of bankrolling peers they see as fiscally reckless and wanting to keep their EU budget reductions.
Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban has tightened the noose around academics, media and civil society, pushed back against new mechanisms that would allow the freezing of funds for countries undercutting the rule of law, a point of principle for the wealthy net payers. 
Eyes are also on German Chancellor Angela Merkel, standing at the helm of the biggest EU economy, who has thrown her weight behind pushing for a deal despite gaps needing to be bridged. 
The coronavirus has come as the latest existential challenge to the EU, which has lurched from one crisis to another in recent years, from the financial meltdown that started more than a decade ago to a spike in uncontrolled immigration and then Brexit. 
Bickering between member states over money, medical supplies and border closures exposed divisions in the world's largest trading bloc though it has since managed to agree on half a trillion euros of immediate economic relief.
""It is possible to have an agreement this weekend and it is desirable,"" a French presidency source said. ""There is an expectation for a European solution.""
ING said in a note this week that a deal seemed within reach: ""A deal now would be huge, but any sign of further progress on the remaining contested issues would also still be positive.""

224,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>","Americans on COVID-19 jobless benefits spent more than when working, study shows","By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - Americans who received enhanced unemployment benefits due to the coronavirus pandemic spent more than when they were working, a study released on Thursday said, adding to concerns about a steep fall in spending when the emergency benefits expire.
The $600 weekly supplement added to jobless benefits as part of the CARES Act helped unemployed households spend 10% more after receiving benefits than they did before the pandemic, according to research by the JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Institute.
Researchers analyzed transactions for 61,000 households that received unemployment benefits between March and May. Spending dropped for all households as the virus spread and led to business shutdowns, but then rose when households began receiving jobless benefits, the study found.
That contrasts with a typical recession, when households receiving unemployment benefits usually cut spending by 7% because regular jobless benefits amount to only a fraction of a person's prior earnings, the research found.
The analysis highlighted how the additional unemployment benefits are helping to prop up the U.S. economy and consumer spending after the pandemic led to a surge in joblessness across the country. 
More than 30 million Americans are estimated to be receiving unemployment benefits - and they could be pushed off an income cliff when the supplemental benefits, which are due to expire at the end of July, are withdrawn.
""Our estimates suggest that expiration will result in large spending cuts, with potentially negative effects on both households and macroeconomic activity,"" the researchers wrote. 
The data also reflected the financial pain faced by households that encountered big delays in collecting benefits after states across the country were overwhelmed by applications. 

Households that had to wait several weeks for their first unemployment check to arrive cut spending by about 20%, the study found. Spending recovered after the checks arrived.

Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying also invited U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to come to China and visit the western Xinjiang region to see that there are no human rights violations, responding to Washington's sanctions and accusations of wrongdoing against the Uighur Muslim minorities who live there. 
Relations between Beijing and Washington are at the worst in decades as they clash on multiple fronts including China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, the new national security law in Hong Kong, trade and the accusations of human rights crimes in Xinjiang. 
Washington on Tuesday removed special status designation for Hong Kong and imposed sanctions against top Chinese officials and companies over Hong Kong and Xinjiang. Beijing condemned the moves and vowed to retaliate. 
The New York Times reported that the United States is considering a travel ban against all members of China's ruling Communist Party, a move that would further strain an increasingly confrontational relationship.
Hua told reporters during a daily briefing that such a ban, if true, would be ""pathetic."" 
Asked whether the recent sanctions imposed by Washington will impact the trade deal, Hua told reporters that China hopes the agreement can still be implemented. 
""We always implement our commitments but we know that some in the U.S. are oppressing China and bullying China,"" she said. ""As an independent sovereign state China must respond to the bullying practices by the U.S. side; we must say no, we must make responses and take reactive moves to it."" 
""If the U.S. thinks that everything China does is a threat, then it will be a self-fulfilling prophecy."" 
Hua also called Washington's accusations of human rights crimes against the Uighur minorities the ""biggest lies of the century"".

""We welcome him (Pompeo) to travel to our country and see what the Xinjiang people's view of him is,"" she said. ""I could introduce him to some Uighur friends.""

226,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday, July 16th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- China becomes the first major economy to return to year-on-year growth post-Covid-19, but the country's stock market tanks after heavy-handed state intervention. Twitter reels from a massively embarrassing and rather suspicious hack attack. Retail sales, jobless claims and house price data are due in the U.S., as are earnings from Johnson & Johnson,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). And Christine Lagarde will try to convince the world that the ECB isn't easing off in its fight against the pandemic. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, July 16th.
1. China's economy returns to growth; its stock market reverts to type
China became the first major global economy to return to growth in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, with gross domestic product rising 3.2% on the year in the second quarter, and 11.5% from the first three months of the year. Both numbers were above analysts’ expectations.
However, the Chinese stock market tanked and the yuan weakened after the People’s Daily newspaper attacked drinks company Kweichow Moutai for its overpriced liquor and flagged alleged links to corruption. The stock is a popular one with the retail investors who have piled into the market in recent weeks, and making it a target has the effect of cooling off the whole market.
Another factor that weighed on sentiment was the fact that some monthly data disappointed, with retail sales still running 1.8% below last year’s levels in June.
2. Retail sales, jobless claims due
Retail sales for June will also be the focus of Thursday’s data dump in the U.S., with the range of potential outcomes seemingly broader there than in the labor market, where the pattern of a grindingly slow decline in jobless claims is now firmly established.
Both sets of data are due for release at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), along with the Philadelphia Fed’s monthly business survey. The NAHB housing market index is due at 10 AM, while New York Fed President John Williams’ speech at 9:10 AM may also draw attention.
Retail sales had rocketed by a record 17.7% in May, as the U.S. started to lift its lockdowns. Another 5.0% increase is expected for June. Initial jobless claims are expected to fall to 1.25 million from 1.315 last week, while continuing claims are expected to drop below 18 million.
3. Stocks set to open lower; banks, health and Netflix earnings eyed
U.S. stocks are set to open lower, retracing after a buoyant reaction on Tuesday to a better-than-expected rebound in industrial production and Goldman Sachs’s blowout second quarter. Rivals Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Bank of America will have their work cut out to match it when they report before the opening.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 190 points or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was down 0.8% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 1.5%
In addition to Morgan Stanley and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), there are also updates due from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). Streaming giant Netflix reports after the close.
Other stocks likely to be in the spotlight include American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), which outlined plans late on Wednesday to furlough up to 25,000 workers when the company’s federal aid expires on Oct. 1, and Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE), which named Disney’s parks head Michael Colglazier as its new CEO. It’s the second divisional boss Disney (NYSE:DIS) has lost in as many months.
4. ECB meets; EU slams data transfer practises
The European Central Bank’s governing council is meeting, but is not expected to announce any changes to monetary policy at 7:45 AM ET (1145 GMT) after June’s package of easing measures.
Of more interest will be President Christine Lagarde’s press conference starting at 8:30 AM, where the attention will be on any hints of limits to the central bank’s activism in supporting markets.
Europe’s top court meanwhile ruled earlier that the current framework for data transfers from the EU to the U.S. isn’t up to scratch (effectively dissing the effectiveness of U.S. data privacy rules). The ruling has potentially far-reaching effects for many U.S. and European companies, not least the social media giants.
5. Twitter hacked
One particular social media giant has some soul-searching to do. Twitter’s platform was hacked in a high-profile attack that compromised the accounts of, among many others, Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Joe Biden. The attack comes only a few months after CEO Jack Dorsey’s account was hacked.
The hack was ostensibly driven by scammers, who posted messages encouraging Bitcoin donations. Around $100,000 in Bitcoin was stolen, according to various reports (the price of Bitcoin fell over 2% in response to yet another illustration of its links to illicit activity).
However, it can’t be ruled out that the Bitcoin aspect of the hack was intended to divert attention from something else.  After all, if you had access to Elon Musk’s account and you had any inkling of how far it could move Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares in the current environment, why would you satisfy yourself with $100,000 worth of cryptocurrency?
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock was down 6.6% in premarket trade."
227,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>","Amid national debate on race, Fed's Bostic sees central bank role on inequality","By Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - A rising stock market alongside 11% unemployment has put the U.S. Federal Reserve in a quandary amid the national debate over racial and economic fairness: Is it helping fix the problems its top officials agree need fixing, or deepening divides between Black and white, and rich and poor?
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, pressing what he hopes will be a transformative discussion about race and economic inequality, said in an interview with Reuters that fixing on questions like today's stock prices ""kind of misses the reality"" of how deep and longstanding the economic wedge is between U.S. minority populations and most whites.
""We did not get to this point in like three days. So there is not going to be one silver bullet or one action"" that dents problems like the roughly 10-to-1 gap between Black and white household wealth, differences in income that persist regardless of education levels, or a Black jobless rate nearly double that of whites before the pandemic.
The reckoning needs to be deeper, grappling with a legacy of economic disadvantages from slavery through legal segregation, he said. Far from being leveled by market forces or government policy, those have compounded over time to the detriment not just of Blacks but of the country as a whole.
""Economic models don’t have 'reachback loops' for things that have happened in the past to figure out what an optimal strategy for today might be,"" said Bostic, the first Black to head one of the Fed's 12 regional branches. ""We are leaving talent on the table. We are leaving money on the table. And it is in all of our interest to try to find that money."" 
It is an insight that opens a broader discussion - of whether monetary reparations to repair the damage of discrimination make sense, for example, of how tax, social and employment policy should change, of whether the Fed should build racial metrics into its policy analysis or be given broader powers to help individual households.
Bostic remains open to all ideas and ""could imagine"" a day when the unemployment rate for Blacks gets highlighted in Fed statements as a way to measure the true strength of the labor market. As in the decade-long recovery that just ended, it is only late in economic cycles that the gap in joblessness between Blacks and whites tends to narrow. 
Bostic speaks Thursday at an event with Jared Bernstein, an adviser to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and a proponent of the Fed using Black unemployment to measure the ""full employment"" side of its dual mandate of plentiful jobs and stable inflation. That is among the recommendations offered by a Democratic ""unity task force"" that would make the Fed more squarely responsible for ensuring the benefits of economic growth are better shared.
PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES
For some, the discussion is overdue. 
The Fed's 1970s fight with inflation still defines much of its debate and analysis, even though the risks to growth posed by economic inequality may be greater today than the risks of prices rising too fast, said Mehrsa Baradaran, a University of California Irvine law professor. She argues the Fed needs to expand from its current practice of working mostly through the banking system.
""Immediately, tomorrow,"" she said, the Fed could start buying municipal bonds of ""every city or area that is a low-income or formerly red-lined community. They float bonds and the Fed buys it up and creates that market."" 
It may seem a stretch - and Baradaran and others of like mind acknowledge their ideas are more fiscal in nature, and should be the province of Congress. 
Yet the pandemic has led the Fed to buy corporate bonds, make short-term loans to municipalities with adequate credit ratings, and participate in direct loans to smaller companies - boundary-breaking steps and evidence the Fed can push in new directions.
""I think the Federal Reserve has more agency in structuring its programs than they may want to admit,"" said former Fed Governor and Duke University law professor Sarah Bloom Raskin.
Raskin noted the Fed has taken bold steps with no prior record of how tools like corporate bond buying might work in the United States to achieve goals like raising employment. So why not take others as well?
""We don't exactly understand how buying a fixed-income (Exchange Traded Fund) transmits to high employment ... It is an experiment that has not yet been proven,"" she said of one new Fed program meant to stabilize the corporate bond market.
Fed officials take a narrow view of how much they can influence the distribution of economic gains, arguing they can't change the technological or legal structure of the economy, act outside of governing statutes or political constraints, or do much beyond trying to drive unemployment as low as possible. 
But the central bank also has been paying attention. As a group they speak more frequently about racial disadvantages and overall inequality, and Bostic recently wrote an essay on the subject - all part of a ""bully pulpit"" campaign Bostic says can be influential and is here to stay.
Formal analysis being presented to the Federal Open Market Committee is including more and deeper looks at how inequality effects the overall economy, and Bostic said if nothing else the Fed can drive research to help other officials craft better policies and help businesses revamp, for example, hiring and promotion practices.
Progress, Bostic said, will need to involve everyone.

""This may be a moment in time when there is a broader collection of people starting to coalesce ... There is a recognition that distributions do matter,"" he said. ""I don't think policymakers are going to have the luxury to just ignore that.""

228,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 06:09AM ET</span>",Virus Fears Hurt U.S. Economy Whether Locked-Down or Reopened,"(Bloomberg) -- As a second wave of coronavirus cases spreads across the U.S., economists say fear of the disease likely plays a bigger role in stalling business activity than any rules that governments put in place.That’s the key finding in a series of studies that cast doubt on the effectiveness of attempts to reopen the economy while the pandemic is still raging. The research also suggests that reluctance to re-impose lockdowns on economic grounds may be misplaced.The U.S. has the world’s largest number of coronavirus cases and deaths, and it’s reporting rising levels at a time when many other countries appear to have gotten a grip on their outbreaks. That divergence may soon have consequences for the economy if it takes longer for American shoppers or diners to get comfortable returning to prior habits.
In a study of customer visits to more than 2.25 million businesses, University of Chicago economists Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson found that traffic fell by 60 percentage points -- and that legal restrictions explained only slightly more than one-tenth of that drop.The decline began before stay-at-home orders were in place, was closely tied to the number of virus deaths locally, and showed that consumers were actively avoiding the busier stores, according to the paper distributed by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
“The politicians like to feel like they’re the ones in control of making the decision, but at the end of the day the virus is the boss,” said Goolsbee, a former aide to President Barack Obama. “If the death rate goes back up and people get scared, the economy will get worse. It could easily wipe out the economic recovery that you generated in the short run by getting rid of the order.”
‘Getting Scared’
That’s why the key pandemic data-point is the reinfection rate, known as R0, he said: “We are going to end up back to the plan which is we have to do everything to get the R0 down so this disease peters out.”
Job losses in states that were initially hit harder by the pandemic, or that imposed stay-at-home orders earlier, weren’t significantly higher than in other states with slower outbreaks or responses, according to another paper published by the NBER in April.There’s not much evidence that “the timing of the lockdowns was significant,” in a crisis that was a national phenomenon rather than a local one, said its co-author David Wiczer, an assistant professor of economics at Stony Brook University.“In all of these states, you saw very similar magnitudes and timing,” he said. “As soon as people started getting scared is when job losses started.”

229,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>",Japan sees primary budget surplus delayed to 2028 due to virus impact: sources,"By Yoshifumi Takemoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan now expects to achieve a primary budget surplus in the fiscal year 2028, one year later than previously estimated due to fallout from the coronavirus crisis, three government sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
The delay comes as Japan's massive fiscal stimulus to mitigate the economic damage from the outbreak has further eroded its tattered public finances.
The government had previously expected to bring the primary budget balance, excluding new bond sales and debt servicing costs, to a surplus in the 2027 fiscal year.
Deterioration in Japan's fiscal health would underscore a challenge for policymakers as they try to pull the world's third-largest economy out of a sharp slump, while wrestling with the industrial world's heaviest public debt burden.
It could also keep the Bank of Japan under pressure to maintain ultra-low interest rates for a prolonged period, as it prints money to buy government debt under its yield curve control policy.
In compiling the projections, the government has prepared around four scenarios, which were based on two assumptions that the pandemic would either end quickly or be prolonged, with each of them assuming either high growth or a base-line case, they said.
Even under its most optimistic scenario, the government would have to delay the timing to balance the budget by one year to fiscal 2028, the sources said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to media.
In its draft policy roadmap out last week, the government left out any explicit mention of the fiscal 2025 primary budget surplus goal, raising speculation Tokyo may be backing away from fiscal reform.

231,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 05:06AM ET</span>","Germany’s long, lonely campaign: Battling Wirecard’s short sellers","By John O'Donnell
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German authorities pressed on for four years investigating investors who bet against Wirecard AG (OTC:WCAGY)'s shares, even after a UK regulator concluded that their evidence against the short sellers was ""not sufficient,"" according to documents and people familiar with the matter.
With encouragement from Wirecard's lawyers and despite red flags about the company, financial markets watchdog Bafin and Bavarian state prosecutors in Munich moved swiftly against short sellers after a February 2016 research report alleged fraud and money-laundering at Wirecard, according to confidential documents related to the probe.
The documents, which include hundreds of pages of investigative reports, correspondence and other memos, have not been previously reported. While it is known that German authorities investigated skeptical investors who raised questions about the company behind one of the biggest corporate frauds in German history, the documents provide new details about the speed and tenacity with which they pursued detractors and the extent of their faith in management.
Just a little over a month after the short-seller report was published in 2016, Wirecard's lawyers urged Bafin to investigate, saying any help the regulator could ""provide to us is very much appreciated."" Bafin confirmed to the company the same day that it was investigating the investors for ""market manipulation,"" the emails show.
By mid-May that year, Bafin had sent a 45-page report to prosecutors in Bavaria, where Wirecard is based, urging them to launch a criminal inquiry against 37 investors, including those from the United Kingdom and the United States. 
The investigation ran into a wall a few months later, when British regulators told the Germans they did not have sufficient evidence against the suspects to conduct police searches. But German authorities continued the probe through at least March of this year.
Fraser Perring, one of the authors of the February 2016 report, who had bet on a fall in Wirecard's shares and was investigated for market manipulation, told Reuters he sent Bafin his findings in February 2016. 
Perring said he heard nothing back until he found out in 2018 that he was under criminal inquiry in Germany. ""They persecuted the critics,"" Perring said. Munich prosecutors abandoned their case against him this March. 
A Bafin spokeswoman told Reuters it took all whistle-blower complaints seriously, and that the agency had also investigated Wirecard. Munich state prosecutors declined to comment on the specifics of their investigation into the short sellers. 
UK's Financial Conduct Authority and Wirecard declined to comment. 
The behind-the-scenes details of how German authorities conducted their probe are likely to add pressure on regulators, according to German lawmakers. It comes as the Financial Action Task Force, a global watchdog that oversees money-laundering controls in various countries, is due to review Germany’s record.
Bafin's aggressive approach had ""sent a strong signal that neutered criticism of Wirecard,"" said Fabio De Masi, a German lawmaker who has called for an overhaul of the agency. ""Many small investors took Bafin at its word.""
Wirecard, which started out processing payments for adult entertainment and gambling websites, filed for insolvency on June 25 after the discovery of a 1.9 billion euro hole in its accounts.
German prosecutors have since opened investigations into suspected money laundering, fraud and market manipulation at the company. Markus Braun, the company’s former chief executive, was arrested before being released on bail. Braun’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. 
'VERY URGENT'
Germany's pursuit of short sellers began when Perring’s previously little-known outfit, called Zatarra Research, published its report about Wirecard. The 101-page report alleged it had new evidence that linked Wirecard to money laundering of betting proceeds from offshore poker sites back into the United States, where online gambling was illegal. 
The co-author of the report, Matthew Earl, told Reuters he called Bafin’s whistleblower line in January 2017. ""As soon as I mentioned Wirecard, the person claimed not to be able to speak good English and, a second time, they hung up,"" Earl said. 
He said he heard nothing until he was told more than a year later that he was being investigated by German authorities for suspected market manipulation. In July 2018, prosecutors told Earl in a letter they would not pursue the case against him but did not give a reason. 
Bafin said it acts on information received on its whistleblower line but did not elaborate.
The 2016 Zatarra report had come after German police carried out a ""large-scale"" raid of Wirecard in December 2015 for suspected money laundering, following a request by the U.S. Justice Department, Munich state prosecutors told Reuters in response to questions about this story. They did not elaborate.
The Bafin spokeswoman said the search had brought no ""new information."" 
The U.S. Justice Department declined to comment.
It wasn't the first time that questions had been raised about Wirecard. State prosecutors in Munich told Reuters that they had conducted a two-year investigation into the company over money laundering linked to U.S. online gambling in 2010, but had found no wrongdoing. Reuters could not learn further details of the probe.
At the time, Bafin also carried out its own investigation, looking into links between illegal online gambling in the United States and Wirecard’s bank, according the agency’s spokeswoman. 
Bafin said subsequent checks in 2011 revealed that any shortcomings it had found had been resolved.
When the Zatarra report was released, German officials turned their attention to investors, correspondence between Wirecard's lawyers, Bafin and prosecutors shows.
In an April 1, 2016 email, Wirecard lawyers at Gowling WLG wrote to Bafin, asking whether it was acting against short sellers and insisting the matter was ""very urgent.”
The regulator replied: ""Bafin is investigating the incident with regard to potential market manipulation.""
Gowling declined to comment for this story.
The Bafin spokeswoman said the trigger of the agency's probe into short sellers did not come from Wirecard, but from different sources. ""It is standard procedure that Bafin is in contact with lawyers representing a company,"" she said.
INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE 
On May 12, 2016, Bafin sent its report to Munich prosecutors, outlining the case against a ""network of suspects"" involved in market manipulation. 
The report criticised Zatarra Research for ""emphasising incriminating information but nothing that spoke in favour of"" Wirecard. Although factually accurate, the Zatarra report's negative findings were “misleading,” it concluded. 
In the report, Bafin pointed to the fact that Braun, the CEO at the time, had bought shares in the company, illustrating his faith in it. Braun ""is convinced of the positive development of his company,"" Bafin officials wrote.
It followed up a few days later, forwarding an email from Wirecard’s lawyers to prosecutors that accused short sellers of ""acting as a pack"" against the company.
The Bafin spokeswoman told Reuters the agency doesn’t comment on its assessments. 
A few months later, Munich's state prosecutors asked UK's Financial Conduct Authority for assistance in investigating the British suspects named in Bafin’s report, but they didn’t get far. 
In an internal memo from February 2017, an official at Munich's state prosecutors recorded the results of his conversation with FCA officials. Stephan Necknig wrote they had told him the Germans had relied on “trading behaviour of the suspects as well as anonymous tips by email about their alleged connections with the Zatarra report,” which will “not be sufficient for a search warrant.” In addition, the FCA told him it did not have the power to ask for a search warrant and would have to rely on other agencies. 
Necknig wrote he saw no clear way to pursue the investigation. “I did not see a chance of getting legal assistance from the United Kingdom, neither to carry out home searches nor to interrogate suspects or take over the prosecution,” he wrote. “Seeking legal assistance from Israel or the USA seemed to make even less sense.” 
In an email to Reuters, Necknig confirmed the assessment he had laid out in the memo and said he did not attempt to pursue further investigation in the United Kingdom.
The setback did not deter German authorities, however. In September 2017, in response to a request from Munich state prosecutors, Bafin sent a 9-page report to prosecutors outlining short positions in Wirecard stock and potential profits of some of the investors it was investigating. 

The probe continued at least through this year. In March, just three months before Wirecard’s collapse, prosecutors dropped their case against Perring after he agreed to make a donation of an undisclosed sum to a charitable organization.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy returned to growth in the second quarter after a deep slump at the start of the year, but unexpected weakness in domestic consumption underscored the need for more policy support to bolster the recovery after the shock of the coronavirus crisis.
Asian share markets and the Chinese yuan  fell, partly reflecting the broad challenges facing the world's second-largest economy as it grapples with the double-whammy of the pandemic and heightened tensions with the United States over trade, technology and geopolitics.
Gross domestic product (GDP) rose 3.2% in the second-quarter from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday, faster than the 2.5% forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll, as lockdown measures ended and policymakers ramped up stimulus to combat the virus-led downturn. 
The bounce was still the weakest expansion on record, and followed a steep 6.8% slump in the first quarter, the worst downturn since at least the early 1990s. 
""As we previously highlighted, policy support is still needed despite recovering growth momentum,"" Betty Wang, ANZ bank's senior China economist.
""The possibility of resurgences in local COVID-19 cases, global economic uncertainty and the deteriorating China-U.S. relationship all pose downside risks to China’s H2 growth outlook,"" Wang said.
Those risks were partly reflected in separate retail data that showed Chinese consumers kept their wallets tightly shut, pointing to a bumpy outlook at home and overseas, as many countries continue to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic - led by surging infections in the United States. 
Though June indicators and GDP numbers largely beat expectations, Rodrigo Catril, a foreign exchange strategist at NAB in Sydney, said they also revealed ""the China consumer remains behind in terms of the recovery story.""
""It's very much a story of government stimulus-led recovery, which is very much focused on the industrial side. The consumer remains very cautious. That cautiousness is something the market is looking at in terms of countries where the consumer plays a bigger role, so that's obviously relevant for the U.S. as well.""
Retail sales were down 1.8% on-year in June - the fifth straight month of decline and much worse than a predicted 0.3% growth, after a 2.8% drop in May.
Domestic job losses have been one of the worries for consumers, as many businesses struggled to stay in the black. 
Wanda Film, for example, China’s largest cinema chain operator which has more than 600 cinemas, on Tuesday warned of a first half net loss of 1.5-1.6 billion yuan ($214-228 million), after the coronavirus kept its cinemas shut for almost the entire period.
U.S. TENSIONS, STRUCTURAL ISSUES
In the first half of the year, the economy contracted 1.6% from a year earlier, underscoring the sweeping impact of the virus which first emerged in China late last year and has killed over 583,000 people worldwide.
The rising tensions with the United States and the pandemic have added to structural issues that China has been facing for years, including demographic changes, over-investment, low industrial productivity and high debt levels. 
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP jumped 11.5% in April-June, the NBS said, compared with expectations for a 9.6% rise and a 10% decline in the previous quarter.
The government is expected to offer more support on top of a raft of measures already announced, including fiscal spending boost, tax relief and cuts in lending rates and banks' reserve requirements. 
But debt worries have kept a leash on China's stimulus tap. Net fiscal stimulus unveiled so this year amounted to just over 4 trillion yuan ($571.76 billion), much restrained compared the spending burst in other major economies including the United States and Japan.
The Institute of International Finance estimates China's total debt rose to 317% of gross domestic product in the first quarter of 2020, up from 300% in late 2019 and the largest quarterly increase on record.
The industrial economy offered some hope for the nation as it tries to regain its footing, with output in the vast sector rising 4.8% in June from a year earlier, the third straight month of growth, the data showed, quickening from a 4.4% rise in May. 
Fixed asset investment fell a less-than-expected 3.1% in the first half from the same period in 2019, moderating from a 6.3% decline in the first five months, while real estate investment growth also quickened to 8.5% in June, thanks to the credit boost. 
While the International Monetary Fund has forecast China to expand 1.0% for the full year, the only major economy expected to report growth in 2020, many analysts caution about the outlook.
""Domestic demand will drive China's recovery ahead, but external demand could be a risk to the growth outlook given the possibility of large second round of coronavirus infections overseas,"" said Oshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - U.S. Customs placed a detention order on imports of products made by subsidiaries of the world's largest medical glove maker, Malaysia's Top Glove Corp Bhd (KL:TPGC) on Wednesday, an action taken against firms suspected of using forced labor.
The bar on Top Glove products comes at a time when demand for the medical gloves and protective gear has skyrocketed due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit the United States harder than any other country.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) website showed Top Glove Sdn Bhd and TG Medical Sdn Bhd were placed on its list on Wednesday but there was no statement explaining the action, though its ""withhold and release"" orders, detaining imported goods, are specific to forced labor issues.
In a filing to the bourse, Top Glove, which also has production facilities in China and Thailand, confirmed the detention order and said it may be related to foreign labor issues, specifically recruitment fees paid by migrant workers to employment agents.
""We are reaching out to the CBP through our office in U.S., customers and consultants, to understand the issue better and work towards a speedy resolution of the matter, within an estimated 2 weeks,"" it said.
Top Glove said it had been bearing all recruitment fees since the start of this year, but it had still to resolve an issue regarding retrospective payment of recruitment fees paid, without its knowldege, by workers to agents before January 2019. 
""Over the past few months we have been working on this issue which involves extensive tracing, to establish the correct amount to be paid back to our workers, on behalf of the previous agents,"" the company said.
A Reuters query reached CBP outside its office hours.
By early afternoon on Thursday, Top Glove's share price had slipped 2.57%, a minor blip after a rise of over 350% this year.
Last year, CBP took similar action against another Malaysian glove maker WRP Asia Pacific Sdn Bhd. The detention order on imports of WRP's goods was lifted in March after remedial action was taken.
Independent migrant worker rights specialist Andy Hall said in a note to reporters on Thursday that forced labor amongst foreign workers in Malaysia's gloves industry can only be addressed and reduced when past recruitment fees and related costs, that hold them in debt bondage, are fully repaid.
""Likewise, in order to ensure no future debt bondage of these workers, ethical recruitment practices or zero cost recruitment policies should be put in place in practice, and not only on paper, if the industry moves ahead to recruit more foreign workers in the future,"" he said.
World consumption of protective gloves is expected to jump more than 11% to 330 billion pieces this year, two-thirds of which are likely to be supplied by Malaysia, according to the Southeast Asian country's rubber glove manufacturers association.

Top Glove's annual glove production is 78.7 billion pieces, and its 45 factories also make face masks, condoms and dental products. During a results briefing last month, the company said it had achieved unparalleled growth, boosted by demand increase from almost everywhere.

234,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>",With inflation in India ticking higher it may be time for RBI to pause,"By Swati Bhat
MUMBAI (Reuters) - With India's economic growth sputtering, the Reserve Bank of India was expected to maintain a rate-cutting cycle, but an uptick in near-term inflation could give the central bank's Monetary Policy Committee reason to pause for now.
Having cut its key lending rate by an aggressive 115 basis points (bps) in 2020, on top of 135 bps cuts in 2019, the RBI so far has had little success in spurring credit growth amid varying degrees of lockdowns across India.
Some economists and market insiders argue it may be prudent for the MPC, the policy committee, to hold its fire when it meets early next month.
""It's probably too early to administer a demand stimulus. The RBI still has room to cut rates, but we probably want to be more cautious of the timing,"" said Venkat Pasupuleti, portfolio manager at Dalton Investments. 
""Maybe they should wait a quarter to see how things pan out once the lockdown situation is eased further.""
Market participants have factored in at least a 25 bps rate cut by the MPC on August 6 while analysts are predicting a total 50-75 bps cuts over the rest of the fiscal year that runs to March 31.
The spike in the retail inflation rate above the RBI's mandated 2%-4% target range is another reason for the central bank to take a breather, analysts say. 
Annual retail inflation  rose to 6.09% in June, compared to 5.84% in March and sharply above a 5.30% median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
Rahul Bajoria, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), said the spike in both consumer and wholesale prices ""could lead to a tempering in enthusiasm for material front-loaded policy support from here on.""
Almost all economists however agreed the RBI cannot move away from its accommodative stance or call an end to the rate cutting cycle just yet. 
India's economy grew at 3.1% in the March quarter - an eight year low - and some economists have predicted a contraction of more than 20% in the June quarter and a contraction of up to 5% in the fiscal year. ""Even in the event of a pause, we think the RBI and MPC would want to hold out the promise of more cuts,"" said A. Prasanna, economist with ICICI Securities.
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said in a recent speech the need of the hour is to restore confidence, preserve financial stability, revive growth and recover stronger, suggesting inflation concerns are unlikely to deter the downward trajectory for rates too soon.

""The August policy decision would boil down to a judgment call over whether RBI can maintain easy monetary and financial conditions without the aid of a token rate cut,"" Prasanna said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's financial system remains robust and resilient even as the economy suffers its most severe downturn due to the coronavirus pandemic, central bank chief Ravi Menon said on Thursday.
Data this week showed that the trade-reliant economy plunged into recession in the second quarter after contracting by a record 41.2%.
There was substantial uncertainty over the global economic outlook, the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) managing director told a news conference after the central bank's annual report was released.
""The economic situation remains dire. The recovery is likely to be slow and uneven, weighed down by renewed outbreaks of infection here or abroad,"" he said.
The MAS maintained its official GDP forecast in the range of -4% to -7% for 2020, keeping Singapore on track for its biggest ever slump.
The central bank eased its monetary policy in March, while the government has pumped in nearly S$100 billion ($72 billion) worth of stimulus and emergency relief measures to blunt the impact of the pandemic and lockdown measures.
""The aim of monetary policy during this crisis is to prevent a broadening of disinflationary pressures that would be destabilising for the economy,"" Menon said.
Responding to a question on whether Singapore was seeing asset inflows due to the political uncertainty in Hong Kong, Menon reiterated that this was not significant.
""We've seen increased flows into Singapore from a variety of destinations and that includes Hong Kong but the amounts are not large. And if you look at Hong Kong's data, it'll also saw the same thing - there are no significant outflows,"" he said.
""There are more enquiries as you would expect when there is greater uncertainty in Hong Kong but actual fund flows are not very large. Flow of activity of businesses also is not significant,"" Menon said.
China imposed a sweeping new security law in Hong Kong this month, adding to worries over the risk of a flight of capital and talent as Beijing tightens its grip on the financial hub. 
Menon also said the MAS is working with local economic agencies to discuss gradual repayment of relief mesures by businesses and individuals, and hoped to make an announcement around October.
""We want to avoid cliff effects"" from a sudden withdrawal of that support, he said.

Singapore has rolled out measures to help individuals and small busineses manage their cash flows and meet their financial obligations, such as loan repayments and insurance premiums.

236,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 01:35AM ET</span>","World Bank says Indonesia's reforms may hurt environment, labour rights","JAKARTA (Reuters) - The World Bank on Thursday criticised some of Indonesia's planned reforms to make environmental and labour rules more business friendly, warning they could have adverse effects, especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Thursday's release of a report by the bank coincided with trade union protests in several cities seeking cancellation of an ""omnibus bill"" that aims to revise dozens of existing laws to ease the way for investment in Southeast Asia's largest economy.
The World Bank described the bill as ""a potential step in the right direction"", praising measures to remove discriminatory practices against foreign investors and streamline export-import rules.
However, ""the bill includes reforms that could have adverse effects on people's health and safety, natural assets, and labor rights,"" the multilateral lender wrote in the report.
Satu Kahkonen, World Bank Country Director Indonesia and Timor Leste, told a streamed briefing the bank is concerned with the relaxation of environmental study requirements.
""It's going to move Indonesia's environmental legislation further away from international best practice and this is not basically helping Indonesia,"" she said.
The planned exemptions of minimum wage and reforms to phase out severance pay ""could weaken the protection of workers and increase income equality"", especially during heightened unemployment due to the coronavirus crisis, the bank wrote in the report.
Kahkonen called for clear sequencing plans for the unemployment benefit system and severance pay adjustments.
Green activists and labour groups have raised similar concerns.
In a joint statement on Thursday, labour unions complained their views had not been incorporated in the parliamentary debate and accused lawmakers of siding with companies.
Officials at the economic ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
Supratman Andi Atgas, chairman of the parliamentary body that deliberates on the bill, said rules on environmental protection would only be simplified, but not changed, adding that lawmakers are aware of unions' aspirations.
The World Bank predicts Indonesia's economic growth will flatline this year due to the pandemic, with activity possibly contracting 2% if the country is forced to reimpose restrictions on people's mobility due to a new wave of infections.
The government's GDP forecast ranges from a 0.4% contraction to 1% growth this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global economic activity is picking up after an unprecedented decline this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, but a second major wave of infections could trigger more disruptions, the International Monetary Fund's top official said.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the fiscal costs of actions aimed at containing the pandemic and mitigating its economic fallout were driving up already high debt levels, but it was premature to start withdrawing needed safety nets.
""We are not out of the woods yet,"" she said in a blog posting ahead of Saturday's virtual meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20 major economies.
The IMF last month further slashed its 2020 global output forecasts, predicting a 4.9% contraction and weaker-than-expected recovery in 2021. [nL1N2E1181]
Georgieva said $11 trillion in fiscal measures by G20 members and other countries, as well as massive central bank liquidity injections, have put a floor under the global economy.
Even so, dangers lurked, she said, including a major new wave of infections, stretched asset valuations, volatile commodity prices, rising protectionism and political instability.
Some countries lost more jobs in March and April than had been created since the end of the 2008 global financial crisis, and many of those jobs will never return, Georgieva said.
Job losses, bankruptcies and industry restructuring could pose significant challenges for the financial sector, including credit losses to financial institutions and investors, she said.
To ensure stability, continued coordination across central banks and support from international financial institutions was essential, she said. Regulation should also support the flexible use of capital to keep credit lines open for businesses.
""Monetary policy should remain accommodative where output gaps are significant and inflation is below target, as is the case in many countries during this crisis,"" she said.
In a report to the G20, the IMF warned that rising protectionism and renewed trade tensions endangered the recovery.
A weak recovery itself raised the chances of disinflation and a prolonged period of low interest rates, which could undermine debt sustainability and financial stability, it said.

238,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 11:45PM ET</span>",Australia expands wage subsidy scheme as COVID-19 cases surge,"By Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Australian government is injecting a further A$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion) into a wage subsidy programme to counter rising unemployment as the country posted the biggest rise in coronavirus cases since early April.
Australian officials reported 327 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, a surge that was almost entirely due to the state of Victoria, which posted its biggest ever one-day rise in infections.
Victoria, Australia's second-most populous state, has been isolated from the rest of the country for more than a week following a fresh outbreak of the disease. The 4.9 million residents in its capital, Melbourne, have been ordered to stay home except for essential business.
""If you want to get out of these sort of restrictions as fast as possible, then we all have to play our part,"" Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said, urging people to get tested and limit exposure to others.
Australia has recorded nearly 11,000 cases of COVID-19, including 113 deaths. That remains well below many other countries, but a spike in the number of cases in recent days has worried officials.
The economy has taken a substantial hit and is headed for the country's first recession in almost three decades. A further shutdown in Victoria would tighten the screws further. 
The government on Thursday announced it would spend A$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion) to substantially extend a program to subsidise the wages of apprentices. The funds will more than double the number of apprentice workers covered, to around 180,000 across all industries and to run until March next year, instead of September as originally planned. 
That decision gives the first indication of how Prime Minister Scott Morrison plans to prop up the economy beyond September when a broader A$60 billion wage subsidy package is still due to expire.
Morrison welcomed data out on Thursday showing that jobs grew by more than expected in June - rising by 210,000, compared with declines in April and May and analyst expectations of a 112,000 increase - as evidence his government's support packages were working. 
""The Australian economy is fighting back,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra. ""We are ensuring there will be additional support to ensure those unable to get themselves into a new position.""
A further A$500 million would be invested to help re-train Australians to re-enter the work force, Morrison said.
However, the data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics also showed that unemployment rose to 7.4% in June, from 7.1% in May, the highest level since November 1998, as the rise in jobs was not enough to offset a rise in job hunters.
Morrison has said previously the broader wage subsidy scheme would not be extended, but replaced with industry specific support. Full details are expected to be announced on July 23 when the government gives an economic and fiscal update.

The Reserve Bank of Australia called for more fiscal support, cautioning that the economy will need ""considerable"" support for some time.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japan government campaign to kickstart domestic tourism after the coronavirus outbreak has come under fire with officials in Tokyo and the countryside saying it's too soon to boost travel from the capital, hit by a spike in new cases.
A panel of experts was set to meet with Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura to discuss the multi-billion dollar ""Go To"" promotion on Thursday, a day after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike publicly queried the campaign's timing and methods.
Scheduled to kick off July 22, the campaign will see travellers receive subsidies of as much as 50% in an effort to boost tourism-reliant economies outside of Japan's major population areas. Nishimura said he wanted to hear the panel's opinions on containment measures, such as preventing large gatherings and ensuring ventilation in means of transport. 
But opposition lawmakers and others have raised concerns that with infections in the capital Tokyo running at their highest level since the outbreak began - currently around 100-200 daily - city dwellers could spread the virus through regions that have been relatively lightly hit by COVID-19.
""I don't see why it can't be delayed a bit, or it could be limited to certain regions,"" said Ryuta Ibaragi, governor of Okayama in the west of the country, which has had just 29 infections out of 23,000 recorded across Japan. Though new cases in the capital have stoked alarm, Japan has not seen the kind of explosive spread that has killed tens of thousands in other countries.
Tokyo itself raised the city's coronavirus alert to its highest level on Thursday. 
""Based on the current situation with infections, I really want them to think again about the timing and method for implementing"" the campaign, Governor Koike said. ""I want to convey this to the national government.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy is likely to return to modest growth in the second quarter after a record contraction, as lockdown measures ended and policymakers stepped up stimulus to combat the shock from the coronavirus crisis.
The gross domestic product (GDP) numbers, due early Thursday, will be closely watched around the world, especially as many countries continue to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic even as China has largely managed to contain the outbreak and has begun to restart its economic engines.
Analysts polled by Reuters forecast GDP to have grown 2.5% in April-June from a year earlier, reversing a 6.8% decline in the first quarter - the first contraction since at least 1992 when official quarterly GDP records started.
However, the expected growth rate would still be the weakest expansion on record.
Rising cronavirus infections in some countries, including the United States, have overshadowed improved demand for Chinese exports while heavy domestic job losses and lingering health concerns have kept consumers cautious.
China's services sector, which is dominated by smaller firms, has not rebounded as quickly as factory production, though there are some signs that consumer confidence is gradually improving.
On a quarterly basis, GDP is expected to have grown 9.6% in April-June, compared with a decline of 9.8% in the first quarter.
Data on Tuesday showed the country's imports in June rose for the first time this year as stimulus boosted demand for building materials, while exports also edged up as overseas economies reopened after lockdowns.
While China's economy is showing a steady recovery, a hard battle still lies ahead as the situation remains severe both at home and abroad, state radio quoted Premier Li Keqiang as saying on Monday.
Along with second-quarter GDP data on Thursday (0200 GMT), China will also release June factory output, retail sales and fixed-asset investment.
DEBT RISKS
Central bank governor Yi Gang has said China would keep financial system liquidity ample in the second half but would need to consider withdrawing support at some point, raising questions among investors over when it may start dialing down stimulus.
A spike in debt risks remain a worry for policymakers, analysts say.
Ruan Jianhong, head of the central bank's statistics department, told a briefing last week that China's macro leverage ratio jumped 14.5 percentage points in the first quarter and climbed further in the second quarter.
Still, analysts expect policymakers to maintain support for the economy for a while longer to ensure the recovery remains on track, particularly given the fragile global economic conditions.
Credit growth is also expected to remain strong. New bank lending hit a record 12.09 trillion yuan ($1.72 trillion) in the first half of the year.

The International Monetary Fund has forecast China's GDP to expand 1.0% for the full year, the only major economy expected to report growth in 2020.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A downward spiral in revenue in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak will pause this month for most U.S. states as
Wednesday's income tax filing deadline generates billions of dollars in payments that would have been due in April.
But looking past the burst of last-minute payments of taxes incurred in 2019 before the pandemic hit, states' revenue outlook remains bleak as a spike in U.S. virus cases dampens hopes for a quick economic recovery.
After the federal government moved its income tax filing day to July 15 from April 15, the 41 states that tax wages also extended their deadline, with most also pushing it to July.
That was the biggest contributor to a dramatic drop in their April personal income tax collections, which fell by $44.8 billion or 62% compared with April 2019, according to the Urban Institute.
""We're going to see much of the foregone revenue from earlier this year catching up now because so much of this was simply the delay in payments,"" said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation.
Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza said she is hoping for ""a revenue bump of as much as $1 billion"" for her state, where income taxes dropped by 48.5% in April.

Most states began fiscal 2021 on July 1 amid an uptick in virus cases, fanning fears of weak income tax revenue ahead.
""The tax returns next year will reflect the 2020 economy and that's part of the reason lots of states anticipate a sharper revenue decline in fiscal 2021 than what they ended up seeing in fiscal 2020,"" said Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies at the National Association of State Budget Officers.

The BOK held its seven-day repurchase rate at 0.5% on Thursday, a move forecast by 19 of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Two expected a 25 basis point cut.
The decision follows an improvement in the jobless rate and recent upticks in confidence among businesses and consumers as authorities manage to keep the domestic spread of the virus under control. Rising home prices, a key concern of the government, may have also made the board hesitant to take further action that would make borrowing costs cheaper and might increase speculation.
“Government’s determination to curb demand and rein in the property market will be a constraint on any further rate cut,” said economist Stephen Lee at Meritz Securities before the decision.
South Korea Unleashes New Property Curbs Amid Soaring Prices
The BOK has taken a raft of measures to protect the economy amid the pandemic, cutting its key rate by 75 basis points, supplying liquidity and purchasing bonds to stabilize financial markets. The government has also implemented record stimulus in three extra budgets so far this year.
Still, analysts are cutting their economic forecasts for South Korea as trouble continues for exports, the country’s biggest growth engine.
The BOK sees the economy shrinking this year for the first time since the late 1990s Asian financial crisis, though its most recent forecast, in May, is slightly more optimistic than the consensus among private sector analysts.
BOK watchers will be monitoring Governor Lee Ju-yeol’s comments in his post-decision press conference for any signs the BOK might downgrade its view when it gives new projections in August. The BOK’s current forecast is for a 0.2% contraction, while analysts project -0.6%.
Lee is scheduled to speak at 11:20 a.m.
More Steps
Investors will also looking for any hints of measures Lee might consider if risks to markets and the economy rise. The governor has been more vocal in recent months about turning to unconventional steps to stimulate the economy, without providing specifics.
While most analysts don’t expect the BOK to adopt quantitative easing or yield curve control like some of its peers, it could further step up bond purchases as the government issues more debt to fund emergency spending.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nearly half of Japan's companies have no immediate plans in place to help counter the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, although a third of those surveyed in a Reuters poll indicated they were looking to improve productivity to cushion the blow.
The survey suggests a long path to recovery for Japan. The world's third-largest economy is expected to shrink at its fastest pace in decades this fiscal year, with economic activity not seen returning to pre-pandemic levels for another 2-3 years, analysts have said.
In the latest monthly corporate survey, 49% said they had no plans in place to cushion the hit to their sales and profits this summer. Among transport equipment makers, Japan's key industry, the rate was higher at about 66%.
However, 51% of the participants said they have plans to overcome the pandemic pain. About 60% of this group, or 30% of total, said improving productivity was their top pick for dealing with the hit to business.
Reviewing business activity and planning new business were the second and third popular choices, though no transport equipment makers picked these.
In written comments, many firms said cutting costs was the best way to respond to declining demand.
""We are taking various steps, but none of them are expected to produce major effects near term,"" a chemicals maker manager wrote in the June 30-July 10 survey, conducted on condition of anonymity so respondents can express their opinions freely.
Three fourth of the firms said their number of workers was unchanged from a year earlier, while two thirds of transport equipment makers said their staffing level was steady.
AUTOS PAIN
The survey underscored the pain inflicted on the automobile sector, which significantly impacts many other industries. 
Some 44% of transportation equipment makers have furloughed up to half their employees, versus 14% of overall firms.
Global car demand has plunged since March as virus-related lockdowns kept people indoors and prompted factories to close.
While many countries have been reopening their economies, analysts say it could take up to five years for demand to recover to 2019 levels.
One in five transport equipment makers expressed concern about capital shortage in the survey, double the ratio of overall firms who voiced such concerns.
Sales in May by Japan's biggest automaker Toyota (T:7203) fell 34% from a year ago, while Nissan (T:7201) sales fell 37.3% and Honda (T:7267) sales slipped 29%.
Asked about business continuation plans, about 30% said they intend to either expand core business or find new ground, while 55% aim to restore business to pre-pandemic levels.
For transport equipment firms, restoring business to pre-pandemic levels was the top choice, followed by reducing or reviewing their core business.
DEFLATION
The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady on Wednesday but warned uncertainty over the outlook was ""extremely high"" due to risks such as a second wave of infections.
Two in five firms in the survey said they were concerned about a return of deflation later this year, while 54% saw prices remaining flat. Just 6% expected prices to rise.
On prices of their products and services, three quarters said they would keep them flat in the second half. Some 17% said they would cut, while 8% intend to lift prices.
""We remain under strong pressure from clients to cut prices, but demand is so weak to begin with that price cuts won't help boost sales,"" an industrial rubber maker manager wrote. 
A retail manager wrote: ""As long as consumers' incomes are on the decline, they will turn to cheap goods and services.""

The survey, conducted for Reuters by Nikkei Research, canvassed 496 big and midsize non-financial firms, with some 230 of them answering questions on the impact of the virus.

LONDON (Reuters) - More than 200 of Britain's top financial experts have joined forces to design initiatives to help small businesses restructure and repay as much as 35 billion pounds ($44.1 billion) in ""unsustainable"" COVID-19 relief debt.
TheCityUK Recapitalisation Group on Thursday proposed the launch of a UK Recovery Corporation (UKRC) to oversee a massive pile of government-guaranteed loans issued since lockdown, offering more manageable terms to borrowers and preventing a wave of bankruptcies borne by the taxpayer.
""COVID-19 is a 100-year storm which has caused untold economic damage. The government's support schemes have been the essential sandbags holding back the flood, protecting businesses and saving jobs,"" said Adrian Montague, chairman of TheCityUK Leadership Council.
""However, with tough trading conditions forecast to remain, paying back these loans will be challenging for many small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs).""
Businesses currently need to start repaying government COVID-19 loans in March. 
But analysis by financial services firm EY - which led the work for the Recapitalisation Group - suggests some firms could run into trouble as early as autumn, when the government furlough scheme tapers off and rent deferrals end, putting up to 3 million jobs at risk and 780,000 SMEs in danger of insolvency.
The report urged immediate action by government including legislating to enable UKRC to act effectively.
A spokeswoman for the Treasury said the report was a useful contribution and the department would continue to engage with the sector on supporting businesses. 
Under the proposals, the government would be the principal investor in UKRC initially but debt could later be sold off in portfolios or securitised and bought by private investors.
Companies supported by the UKRC could either access a 'Business Repayment Plan' to convert state-backed loans under 250,000 pounds into means-tested tax liabilities.
Firms with larger debts of up to 1 million pounds would be able to access the 'Business Recovery Capital' initiative to convert crisis loans into preference shares or long-term subordinated debt, repayable over a longer period of 8-10 years.
Both products would ensure SMEs do not give up any equity.
The final option is the creation of a new growth capital fund, Growth Shares for Business (GSB), which would provide capital to rebuild cash reserves or spur recovery. 
Miles Celic, chief executive of TheCityUK, told reporters banks were mindful of the potential reputational risks involved in pursuing bad debts from struggling firms but said a proposed independent review system should help ensure fair outcomes.
Several lenders including state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) were criticised by politicians for mistreating struggling small businesses after the 2007-09 financial crisis.

EY's UK Financial Services Managing Partner Omar Ali said the recovery corporation could help collect debts over the longer term, adding it was ultimately up to the government to decide the viability criteria for the various schemes.

248,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 06:45PM ET</span>",ECB to take pause even as pandemic worries rise,"By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Taking a pause after a series of extraordinary moves, the European Central Bank is all but certain to keep policy on hold on Thursday, scrutinizing instead the effectiveness and any unwanted side-effects of its crisis-fighting measures.
Tackling the biggest economic collapse in living memory, the ECB has bought record amounts of debt and paid banks to lend out its cash, all in hope of salvaging most of the bloc's economy until Europe is ready to reopen after the coronavirus pandemic.
But its decisions were also made in haste and often guided by acute market stress, like the blowout in Italian borrowing costs this spring, leading some critics to argue that it is bending its own rules too far. 
ECB inaction would also keep up pressure on European Union leaders to finally agree on long-delayed fiscal support, a much-needed measure that would reduce the burden on monetary policy. 
A policy pause is also underpinned by a string of better than expected economic data after a double-digit GDP fall in the three months to June, suggesting that the 19-country euro zone's economic contraction may not have been as bad as feared. 
A looming second wave of the pandemic is raising doubts about the speed of the recovery, however, a point highlighted by ECB chief economist Philip Lane, who argues that Europe faces a ""two step forward, one step back"" recovery. That could mean better data now provides little guidance about the path ahead.
""The ECB can hardly relax, its job is far from done,"" Berenberg economist Florian Hense said. ""Despite the ongoing recovery, the risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside, including the risk of a major second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and harsh, nationwide lockdowns in major European economies.""
Rising coronavirus case numbers around the globe are also likely to weigh on consumer and business confidence, holding back spending and investment and raising the chance that any recovery would be slow, uneven and prone to interruptions.
MORE OF THE SAME
Thursday's ECB meeting is likely to hear some grumbling about the side-effects of the policy, including deviation from the ECB's so-called capital key, which requires the bank to buy bonds in proportion to the size of each euro zone economy. 
While the bank has said this remains a ""guiding"" principle, some worry that straying too far from this rule could open it to yet another legal challenge in Germany, just weeks after that country's top court attempted to curb its powers.
Policymakers are also likely to express annoyance that EU leaders are once again dragging their feet with a fiscal response, overburdening ECB policy, much as they have done over the past five years. They may also discuss the relaunch of a strategy review.
Economists nevertheless argue that more ECB action is just a matter of time. 
When called upon, the bank is still likely to increase bond purchases, provide a bigger exemption to banks from its punitive negative deposit rate and could buy more debt from various EU institutions that support the recovery. 

The ECB delivers its decision at 1145 GMT, which will be followed by ECB President Christine Lagarde's press conference at 1230 GMT.

After Britain completes its split from the EU at year-end, the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will inherit powers over at least 70 policy areas previously decided by the EU, including air quality and animal welfare.
Without further action by the British government, there would be a risk of goods being barred from moving from one part of the U.K. to another after Brexit, because different rules could exist in different parts of the country. Under a plan put out for consultation, the U.K. will adopt a “mutual recognition” principle, whereby each part of the U.K. must recognize the validity of regulations set elsewhere in the country.
“Ensuring businesses will be able to continue trading freely across all four corners of the U.K. without the burden of inconsistent regulation or additional costs will be essential,” said Business Secretary Alok Sharma in a statement. “Without these necessary reforms, the way we trade goods and services between the home nations could be seriously impacted.”
The plan has generated controversy among lawmakers in the U.K.’s devolved administrations, who fear they’ll be forced to accept goods made under inferior standards produced elsewhere in the U.K.
The legislation is also a key part of Britain’s negotiating leverage when conducting free-trade talks with countries such as the U.S. and Canada: the U.K. wants to be able to assure those parties that their goods will be able to circulate freely through the whole country.

250,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",Belt and Road Re-Emerges in Pakistan With Flurry of China Deals,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s Belt and Road program has found new life in Pakistan with $11 billion worth of projects signed in the last month, driven by a former lieutenant general who has reinvigorated the infrastructure plan that’s been languishing since Prime Minister Imran Khan took office two years ago.
The nations signed deals on June 25 and July 6 for two hydro-power generation projects costing $3.9 billion in the disputed Kashmir region, and another to revamp the South Asian nation’s colonial-era railways for $7.2 billion -- the most expensive Chinese project yet in Pakistan.
Khan’s government appointed Asim Saleem Bajwa last year to run the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority, which oversees more than $70 billion in projects from power plants to highways. He also joined Khan’s cabinet in late April, becoming one of more than a dozen former and current military officials in prominent government roles as the army expands its influence in the country.
The Chinese financing has helped rid Pakistan of an electricity deficit that left exporters unable to meet orders and major cities without electricity for much of the day. Still, the implementation of some investments appeared to stall since Khan came to power, with no new projects announced in 2018 and very few in 2019.
Since Chinese President Xi Jinping launched the initiative in 2013, the World Bank estimates about $575 billion worth of energy plants, railways, roads, ports and other projects have been built or are in the works across the globe. Its progress has slowed recently, dogged by accusations that China is luring poor countries into debt traps for its own political and strategic gain.
“The reality is that much of CPEC, like the Belt and Road more broadly, has been paralyzed,” said Jonathan Hillman, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, referring to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Pakistan “is a flagship for China’s Belt and Road, so the need to show progress is even more important.”
In a tweet last month, Bajwa said some detractors had given the “false impression” that CPEC had been slowed. Not only has the pace of work on projects picked up recently, but a great deal of ground work has been done to launch phase two of the project that also includes special economic zones to lure Chinese manufacturers, agriculture, science, technology and tourism, he wrote.
“The prime minister pushed very hard on this,” said Abdul Razak Dawood, Khan’s adviser on commerce and investments said by phone. “We feel that we have to get more and more hydro in our energy mix.”
A spokesman in Bajwa’s office said he was not immediately available to comment.
Little Progress
Pakistan’s army is already responsible for securing every single Beijing-funded project scattered across the country, from the mountains near the Chinese border to the desert in Gwadar where the Chinese operate a port. Its role has become even more important following terrorist attacks on three Chinese-related projects in the past year.
“There is no doubt that PM Khan’s arrival slowed the pace of CPEC projects,” said Mosharraf Zaidi, a senior fellow at Islamabad-based think tank, Tabadlab, and a former principal advisor to the foreign ministry. “The renewed energy and approval we are now seeing is almost entirely likely due to the chairperson having settled in, and being added to Prime Minister Khan’s cabinet.”
Indeed there’s deepening concerns over Islamabad’s ability to service its debts under the program. The Center for Global Development has listed Pakistan among eight nations that face potential debt-sustainability problems because of the initiative. The country must repay China more than double the amount it owes the International Monetary Fund over the next three years, according to an IMF report last year.
For its part, Beijing says its projects in Pakistan had made major progress over the last six years. “China firmly supports the development of CPEC and stands ready to work with Pakistan,” China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular press briefing in Beijing on July 7, adding that future cooperation will focus on social development, livelihood, industry and agriculture in addition to infrastructure construction.
Regional Conflict
The hydro projects are both based in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, a region at the heart of tensions with arch-rival India. The neighbors have fought three wars -- two over Kashmir -- and last year a terrorist attack in the Indian-controlled portion led to the most serious military escalation in more than a decade.
The $2.4 billion Kohala hydro power project is being built on the Jhelum River in Muzaffarabad, just 100 kilometers (62 miles) from where both armies exchange gunfire. The Azad Pattan project -- which will cost $1.5 billion -- is being built on the same river.
“China and Pakistan may also be antagonizing India,” said Hillman. Both hydro projects are in Kashmir, and the railway is part of a much longer, and still far fetched plan to connect China and Pakistan by rail, also passing through occupied territory, said Hillman.
Several countries have run into trouble with Belt and Road projects or had to rework plans after complaints over corruption, padded contracts, heavy debt loads, environmental damage and a reliance on imported Chinese labor over local hires.
Pakistan renegotiated the project to revamp its British-era legacy railway system. It was initially estimated to cost $8.2 billion but that was reduced to $6.2 billion, according to the nation’s railways minister. The final amount is higher than the revised cost but still $1 billion less that initial estimate.
All three new projects have been under discussion for some time before this month’s announcement.
“Though these are difficult projects to get across the line compared to low hanging fruits like coal and LNG power projects that were announced at the start of the Chinese financing projects,” said Samiullah Tariq, head of research at Pakistan Kuwait Investment Company, “China is a critical ally for Pakistan to continue growing.”

252,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 05:45PM ET</span>",Britain publishes plans to keep internal trade flowing after Brexit,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain publishes plans on Thursday to keep trade flowing freely between its constituent nations when regulatory powers are reclaimed from the European Union at the end of the year and redistributed to devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
While it was part of the EU, Britain abided by the bloc's rules in areas like agriculture, the environment, consumer protection and employment rights. Now that Britain has left, those powers will be repatriated to the UK.
Some will remain with the central government in London, others will be distributed to the devolved nations. Thursday's plan will outline who gets what and how they are overseen.
Both the Welsh and Scottish administrations have in the past voiced concern that they will lose out to central government in the distribution.
The government said its plan was designed to ensure rules do not diverge within Britain and create barriers to trade - guided by principles of mutual recognition and non-discrimination.
""We want to ensure the most successful political and economic union of nations in the world continues to grow and thrive,"" said business minister Alok Sharma.
The independence-minded administration of Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland will be watching the distribution particularly closely.
Scotland voted to remain part of the United Kingdom in 2014, but its overall opposition to Brexit has renewed separatist sentiment.
The coronavirus pandemic has also highlighted the tension among the home nations. Despite sharing a land border with England, Scotland and Wales have each chosen to diverge from and often criticise English lockdown rules. 

Nevertheless, British cabinet minister Michael Gove described the plan as a ""power surge"" to devolved administrations. It will be subject to a consultation with Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland before the final wording of legislation is decided.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. businesses saw an uptick in activity into the beginning of July as states eased restrictions to contain the novel coronavirus pandemic, a Federal Reserve report showed on Wednesday, but remained uncertain about the economic outlook amid a recent surge in cases in many parts of the country.
The mixed picture illustrated in the U.S. central bank's latest snapshot of firms' views mirrors wider economic data, from the unemployment rate to factory activity, which have improved since stay-at-home orders were eased in many parts of the country by the end of May, but could soon show signs of faltering.
""Economic activity increased in almost all Districts, but remained well below where it was prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the Fed said in its report, referencing the respiratory disease caused by the virus. ""Outlooks remained highly uncertain, as contacts grappled with how long the COVID-19 pandemic would continue and the magnitude of its economic implications.""
The Fed's survey, known as the ""Beige Book,"" was conducted across its 12 districts from the end of May through July 6.
Economists expect U.S. economic growth contracted at its steepest pace in the second quarter since the Great Depression and original hopes of a swift economic bounceback have been dashed as the United States continues to struggle to contain the virus, almost five months after the first case was reported on U.S. soil.
The Fed's report showed that during the survey period a wide array of industries from leisure and hospitality to professional and business services picked up, but remained weak compared to year-ago levels.
In the Cleveland Fed's district, for example, many sectors indicated they were bringing idled workers back only slowly and were unlikely to rehire all of them in the near term.
Business contacts there also ""remain concerned about the sustainability of the recovery if the spread of COVID-19 is not contained,"" the report said.
That scenario may already be in train. Fed officials on Tuesday warned of ""thick fog"" ahead for the economy as they continued to reset expectations on the pace of recovery amid fears that a broad second wave of cases could cause unemployment to rise again.
A resurgence in new infections, especially in the highly populated South, led by Texas and Florida, and the West, has prompted some authorities in these regions to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings. 
The Dallas Fed reported that while the district regained its economic footing ""the resurgence of... infections and a pause in the reopening of the district economy were causing concerns.""
Likewise the St. Louis Fed said economic activity had rebounded sharply but that the pace of recovery appeared to have slowed since mid-June with contacts ""slightly more pessimistic."" 
The San Francisco Fed noted Los Angeles restaurant contacts were already expecting economic pain to deepen again.

They had ""increased employment modestly but anticipated having to reinstate furloughs due to a reversal in the reopening process,"" the report said.

(Reuters) - Financial markets have improved notably since mid-March when fears about the spreading coronavirus led to instability in key markets, but Federal Reserve officials stand ready to act should markets deteriorate further, a senior New York Fed official said on Wednesday. 
The Fed's purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities were ""unparalleled"" in their scale and speed, amounting to more than $100 billion on some days, said Lorie Logan, an executive vice president at the New York Fed and the manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA). 
""Measures of market liquidity have uniformly improved and are now well below their worst points, though some remain more stressed than at the start of the year,"" Logan said during a webinar organized by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. 
The purchases accounted for most of the increase in the Fed's balance sheet, which grew by $2.6 trillion since mid-March, Logan said. The recent purchases also varied from previous bond buying programs because they were intended to improve market functioning, not lower rates, she said. 
The central bank's balance sheet declined in recent weeks as use of the Fed's operations in the market for repurchase agreements, or repo, dropped to zero for the first time in 10 months.
Logan said the balance sheet drop is a sign of healthy markets and called the decline in the Fed's repo book a ""notable development."" The central bank began intervening in the repo market in mid-September after a shortage in reserves led to a spike in short-term borrowing costs. 
Now that markets are mostly stable, the New York Fed is working to sustain market functioning by continuing to purchase about $80 billion a month in Treasury securities and about $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities, she said. 

""We will remain vigilant for signs of deterioration in market functioning and flexible in adjusting our operations as needed,"" Logan said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union (EU) member states struggled on Wednesday to resolve differences over a massive recovery plan for their coronavirus-hit economies, but agreed a deal was crucial at an end-of-week summit for the bloc's credibility.
With economies in freefall due to the pandemic, European leaders will hold their first face-to-face talks since lockdowns took hold from March and there were weeks of feuding over how the 27-nation bloc should respond.
At stake in the Friday-Saturday summit in Brussels is the EU's next long-term budget and an economic stimulus plan that, together, would be worth around 1.85 billion euros ($2.1 billion).
To reach an accord, many gaps will need to be bridged, especially between wealthy, thrifty northern countries and the high-debt south that has taken the brunt of the COVID crisis.
""A great deal is at stake, the credibility of the European Union is at stake,"" Germany's Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth said after a meeting with EU counterparts.
""We have reached a consensus that we need a quick agreement ... I won't bet on it, but I am optimistic we have a good chance of a breakthrough,"" he told a news conference.
He said there were still many areas of disagreement, particularly over the overall size of a Recovery Fund - which the summit's chair has proposed be set at 750 billion euros - and the question of whether it is disbursed as free grants or loans.
A club of frugal states - Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland - strongly prefers loans to help their peers but avoid bankrolling those they see as fiscally reckless. 
Leaders of the bloc have held a flurry of one-on-one meetings ahead of the summit to persuade the ""frugals"" to drop opposition to splitting the fund into two-thirds grants and one-third repayable loans.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he saw ""very difficult hours ahead"" as he visited Swedish counterpart Stefan Lofven for talks on Wednesday.
""We have different views on the answer to the crisis, but we share a common goal,"" he told a news conference at the Swedish government's countryside residence Harpsund. ""If we delay the response, we delay the recovery and the crisis could get worse. We all have to make some sacrifices to reach an agreement.""

The COVID-19 pandemic is the latest big challenge for the EU after a debt crisis a decade ago, mass immigration in the mid-2010s and the trauma of Brexit. Some have even framed it as an existential dilemma, as eurosceptic feeling grows in countries such as Italy.

The conference board's index of consumer views plunged from a solidly optimistic reading of 106 at the start of the year to a pessimistic level of 92. Anything above 100 is considered positive.
The online poll of 33,000 consumers in 68 countries also pointed to a slow climb back. Confidence in key markets including the United States and much of Europe was expected to ""remain depressed for a sustained period"" because of rising case counts, uncertainty about jobs and income, and lack of trust in government's ability to control the pandemic, the survey concluded.
Among major economies only Germany, China, South Korea and Australia were expected to see confidence ""rebound fairly quickly.""
""Early signs of economic rebound in several markets do not necessarily portend a quick recovery in consumer confidence in the coming months,"" said Bart van Ark, chief economist of the Conference Board, a member organization of large U.S. companies. 
The U.S. index was slightly positive, at 101, the result of a survey done in June when the worst of the pandemic seemed to have past and an economic recovery seemed to be taking shape.
Yet the change from the survey covering the first three months of the year was dramatic, dropping from a record high of 123 as the outlook for jobs, personal finance and spending plans all collapsed. 
Caseloads have been surging since then, and some U.S. states have reimposed restrictions on business to try to slow the spread of COVID-19.
The Conference Board said the seeds of a potential longer-term shift in consumer patterns may be emerging.

A rising share of respondents say they plan to cut down on meals out and vacations, and more than 20% plan to reduce spending on clothes and out-of-home entertainment on a long-term basis.

259,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>",Biggest Banks Gain $10 Billion on Fed Moves to Open Debt Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- March presented the threat of a credit freeze along the lines of 2008. Instead, the Federal Reserve’s efforts to keep debt markets flowing have things looking more like 2009, with concerns about the U.S. economy abundant but times still great on Wall Street trading floors.
The Fed’s moves have meant a $10 billion windfall for the biggest U.S. banks as their bond traders seized on big market swings to set new records, and their bankers arranged a slew of debt deals for companies desperate to raise cash. That helped keep JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). profitable despite a surge in loan-loss provisions, and even delivered a surprise earnings increase at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
The market bonanza has for now eased fears about the type of bank capital concerns that fueled the last crisis and prompted government bailouts. But it also raises questions of whether the Fed’s efforts have disproportionately benefited financial firms rather than the small businesses still struggling with virus-driven lockdowns.
“Goldman’s earnings this quarter were too good -- almost indecent, in fact,” said Octavio Marenzi, chief executive officer of capital markets consultancy Opimas. “The Fed has been able to engineer a huge bounce-back in the markets by injecting trillions of dollars, benefiting investment banks primarily. This will lead to calls for the government to do more to help Main Street rather than Wall Street.”
Debt Bonanza
The $10 billion figure is the gap between the $20.5 billion that the three banks generated from their fixed-income trading and debt underwriting units, and the $10.4 billion average quarter for those businesses over the last four years.
Citigroup’s investment bankers posted their best quarter since the financial crisis, helped by a 41% gain in debt underwriting revenue. At JPMorgan, the firm’s fixed-income traders generated $7.3 billion in the second quarter. That alone would have set a record for total markets revenue, even without the help of the firm’s stock traders.
Goldman boasted that it saw “significantly higher revenues” across all its major fixed-income trading business, particularly in interest rate, credit and commodities products. The group posted its best performance in nine years and topped analysts’ estimates by more than $1.5 billion. The bank’s shares climbed 0.9% at 11:46 a.m. as the major Wall Street firms all rose, including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which both report results Thursday.
“The activity levels that we saw at the end of March and April were really extraordinary,” Goldman CEO David Solomon told analysts on Wednesday. “In a period where there’s enormous change and enormous volatility in markets, we became super busy because our clients are super busy.”
Credit markets have enjoyed a healthy recovery from the virus-induced rout in March after the Federal Reserve promised to buy corporate bonds and other assets to unfreeze trading. U.S. companies responded by selling hundreds of billions of dollars of bonds in the second quarter to shore up liquidity as it became cheaper to borrow. And because corporate bonds tend to trade most after they’re freshly issued, the explosion in debt sales fueled a trading boom as well. Banks could also reverse some markdowns the firms had to take on corporate loans stuck on their books.
The performances are reminiscent of 2009, when credit markets began to recover from the previous year’s sharp declines and bank trading desks set records. That resulted in record profit for Goldman Sachs and allowed many of its Wall Street rivals to quickly rebound and repay their government bailouts even as the recession dragged on.
While the Fed has bolstered Wall Street operations, it has also taken steps to prevent large banks from passing along profits to shareholders, instead encouraging them to hoard capital that can be used to support lending through the pandemic. The central bank last month extended a pause on buybacks, capped dividends at the largest 33 banks at current levels, and forced some to cut payouts or boost capital ratios to maintain them.
The Fed also warned it might conduct an additional test on banks later this year that uses harsher economic scenarios, which could further limit firms’ payouts.
And the nation’s largest banks have cautioned investors that they shouldn’t expect the revenue boom to continue. Citigroup said trading revenue would “normalize,” while JPMorgan told analysts to expect declines in investment banking fees and warned trading revenue may be halved in coming quarters.
Underwriting volumes “will definitely come down,” JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts on a conference call on Tuesday. “All this capital is not being raised to go spend. It’s being raised to sit on the balance sheet so that you’re prepared for whatever comes next.”
The Fed has emphasized that its powers center around lending and its efforts to keep credit flowing are ultimately intended to save jobs. The U.S. government has doled out trillions of dollars in stimulus, much of it to individuals. That has boosted incomes even amid rising unemployment and helped stave off a spike in missed loan payments.
Still, U.S. banks spent much of the first half of the year battening down the hatches, with Citigroup, JPMorgan and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. setting aside almost $50 billion to cover souring loans.
The lenders cautioned they might yet need to set aside more in provisions, depending on the pace and shape of the recovery of the global economy. Many states around the U.S. are seeing a resurgence in coronavirus cases after beginning to reopen earlier this summer.
“If somebody has the crystal ball, I would love to see it,” Citigroup CEO Mike Corbat told analysts on Tuesday. “I would certainly say that the unknowns outweigh the knowns.”

Countries around the world shuttered their economies and imposed travel restrictions earlier this year to halt the spread of the coronavirus which has killed more than 578,000 people.
""COVID-19 and the lockdown measures introduced to address the public health crisis present an unprecedented challenge, as an almost complete collapse of international travel and tourism has taken place since late in 2020 Q1,"" Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance (IIF) said in a report on Wednesday. 
Tourist arrivals tumbled by nearly 100% in the Dominican Republic and Turkey in May, while Vietnam suffered a similar wipe-out in June and Cambodia in April, the IIF report found.
Smaller countries such as Cambodia, Georgia or Croatia felt the hit especially keenly, as international tourism receipts account for more than a fifth of their gross domestic product, the IIF said.
For a graphic on IIF tourism:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklvyzwaqpg/IIF%20tourism.PNG
While many countries have begun emerging from lockdown in recent weeks, a recovery of tourism might be some time off and gradual as travel restrictions remain in place in more than 150 countries. 
Many airline fleets are largely grounded and cruises effectively shut down in many places. Furthermore, consumer behaviour has changed in the wake of the pandemic, the IIF said.
A baseline scenario which predicts a gradual recovery with international arrivals reaching half of last year's total by the end of 2020 would still translate into a decline of two-thirds over the year. 

""A full recovery will likely take more than two years, and a second wave of lockdowns in tourist-generating countries could make matters worse,"" Ribakova said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) said on Wednesday it will sell plant-based burgers and sausages at a Brazilian high-end supermarket chain, entering the country about two weeks after launching in mainland China's retail market through  Alibaba  Group's (N:BABA) Freshippo markets.
Starting on Wednesday, Beyond Meat products will be in 19 upscale St Marché stores in Sao Paulo, the richest city in Brazil. The retailer was founded in 2002 and is partially owned by the world’s biggest consumer-focused buyout firm, L Catterton. Brazil is the world's No. 3 consumer of beef after the United States and the European Union.
The partnership comes as plant-based meat makers, including Beyond Meat's Silicon Valley-based rival Impossible Foods, seek to tap in to the potentially lucrative international markets where plant-based meat buzz is spreading quickly. 
In early June,  Yum China Holdings Inc  (N:YUMC) introduced Beyond Meat burgers for a limited time at some of its KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell locations.
El Segundo, California-based Beyond Meat has been doubling down on expansion in retail outlets, as restaurants around the world shut due to COVID-19 lockdowns. 

Revenue from the company's U.S. retail business rose 157% in the quarter ended March 28 versus a year ago while international retail revenue was up nearly 5,000%, according to a Beyond Meat presentation.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Candidates to lead the World Trade Organization urged members to reach a decision quickly on Wednesday and address what one described as a ""deep crisis"" as it began the vetting process.
Nominations from eight countries have been submitted, including three women, three African candidates and a former Saudi air force pilot, to replace Brazil's Roberto Azevedo, who will step down a year early at the end of August.
His successor faces an unprecedented set of challenges such as intensifying global trade tensions, rising protectionism as well as a coronavirus-induced dive in global trade. 
""This needs to be done as quick as possible,"" said Jesus Seade, a senior trade official in Mexico, describing the trade watchdog as being in ""deep crisis"".
Seade also rebuffed a suggestion that a final decision on the next chief should be delayed until after the U.S. presidential election in November.
Under U.S. President Donald Trump, Washington has urged reform of the WTO and blocked appointments to its top court. But Seade said he thought criticism of the Geneva-based organisation was shared across the political spectrum in Washington.
Nigeria's candidate, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, also said she hoped members would make a quick decision, saying the world was at an ""uncertain juncture"" due to the pandemic.
She also urged Trump or his successor not to leave the WTO and to work with the body on reform.
Egypt's candidate, Hamid Mamdouh, said the top challenge the body was facing was a ""fading sense of common purpose"" and vowed to ""immediately revive the negotiating function of the organisation"". He also urged Beijing and Washington to seek to resolve their trade disputes within the multilateral body.

This phase of the race kicks off up to two months of campaigning followed by a final decision by consensus.

(Reuters) - The United States has failed to control the coronavirus and there is a high level of uncertainty over how much the pandemic will affect the economy, Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker said on Wednesday.
Based on average forecasts, Harker said real GDP growth could drop by 20% in the first half of this year and then grow by 13% in the second half. He said the economy could decline by about 6% for the year
""That's a much sharper recession than we experienced during the financial crisis,"" Harker said in remarks prepared for a webinar, also noting that projections are ""constantly changing along with the path of the virus.""
Policymakers are limited in terms of what they can do to support the economy because much will depend on the path of the virus, Harker said. The Fed responded aggressively in March to support the economy by cutting interest rates to near zero and launching a suite of emergency lending facilities to help keep credit flowing to households and businesses.
The economic recovery is expected to be long and slow, he said. Rather than taking a U-shape, the path of the economy could look more like a ""  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) swoosh,"" Harker said.
Fed officials will support market functioning by keeping rates near zero and by continuing to purchase about $120 billion worth of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities each month, Harker said. Policymakers will unwind the emergency facilities, including a program that supports the corporate bond market, as the economy and markets improve, he said.
Harker said public-private partnerships that provide job training can help to ensure that low-wage workers and minorities take part in the recovery.
""As the recovery takes shape, I want to make sure that the coming growth is not only strong, but inclusive,"" he said.

Clothing chains and department stores across the world have been hit hard by closures during lockdowns. In France, retailers were already suffering after transport strikes in January. 
Pierre Pelarrey, who runs Printemps' flagship store in central Paris, a magnet for foreign shoppers, said business was likely to be half what it was this time last year. 
""We know we're not going to have international clients,"" he said. 
France's official bargain season runs from July 15 until Aug. 11, although many stores have already started promotions in recent weeks, with up to 50% or even 70% off prices.
One bright spot was the return of some French shoppers, Pelarrey said, with many of them more motivated than ever. 
""After coming out of lockdown, people that have come to the store are really buying. One out of two will buy something,"" he said. 
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has struck an upbeat tone on consumer spending, saying last week it had almost returned to normal as people started splurging what they had saved up during a two-month shutdown.
Car sales edged into positive territory in June after France lifted its coronavirus restrictions. 
""Shopping is one way of de-stressing a little ... it's helping us get over this difficult period,"" said Karina Fomba, who works in the hotel sector and was planning to hit the stores on Wednesday. 

French furniture store Conforama, and clothing chains La Halle and Camaieu are among those seeking out buyers as they struggle to survive the crisis.

“We’ve been saying for a long time that the 2% inflation goal is symmetric, which means we should overshoot it. We were having a difficult time doing that, like all developed economies,” Harker said Wednesday during a Bloomberg Television interview with Michael McKee. “I’m supportive of the idea of letting inflation get above 2% before we take any action with respect to the fed funds rate.”
Fed officials left rates near zero at their meeting last month and signaled they would probably keep them there through 2022, according to their quarterly forecasts. The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which Harker votes on this year, next gathers July 28-29.
Outlook Darkening
The Philadelphia Fed chief said his bank was in the process of revising its forecasts for the economy given the resurgence of coronavirus cases in the country’s South and Southwest regions, and warned that a failure to extend enhanced unemployment insurance benefits when they expire at the end of month would further worsen the situation.
“There are things I worry about. One is a cliff effect of unemployment insurance,” Harker said. “Yes, there is a need to get people back to work -- and people want to go back to work. But we can’t just cut it off, because if we cut it off, people will stop spending and that will be a hit on the economy.”
The central bank has rolled out several emergency lending programs and ramped up asset purchases in recent months to foster trading in financial markets during the pandemic. Fed Governor Lael Brainard said Tuesday that it was time for monetary policy makers to discuss a longer-term strategy to support the economic recovery, including offering more specific guidance to the public about how long they would keep their benchmark overnight rate at zero.
“Forward guidance constitutes a vital way to provide the necessary accommodation,” Brainard said. “Refraining from liftoff until inflation reaches 2% could lead to some modest temporary overshooting, which would help offset the previous underperformance.”

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission on Wednesday unveiled plans to clamp down on tax regimes seen as unduly beneficial to big corporations in a move it said would aid Europe's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
European Union countries are seeking to shore up public revenues to fund economic recovery at a time of mounting public anger over tax avoidance by corporations - in particular, multinational digital giants - and wealthy individuals.
The Commission - the EU's executive - said it would expand its tax code of conduct to tackle member states' corporate tax regimes that have broadly harmful effects.
The 1997 code is the EU's tool for blacklisting jurisdictions where tax avoidance or evasion is prevalent but currently it can only address regimes that are deemed preferential: for example, if a country has one tax rate for domestic firms and a different rate for international companies.
Previous plans to change EU tax rules have been thwarted by member states' veto powers, which mean it takes only one country to block proposed tax reforms.
But the Commission is exploring options to side-step the veto system, possibly by using an article in the EU constitutional treaty that could allow a majority to authorise tax decisions if fair competition is at stake.
EU economics commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said work is underway to identify cases where the article could be used.
""We're talking about the possibility of deciding on cases of serious distortion to the single market,"" he said.
EU efforts to retrieve taxes from digital giants suffered a blow on Wednesday when the bloc's second-highest court rejected a Commission order that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland.

The Commission in May identified six EU countries - Cyprus, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands - as having tax systems particularly attractive to big corporations.

The survey by the National Retail Federation (NRF) calculated overall spending in one of U.S. retailers' most important periods would rise about 26% compared to last year.
College spending is expected to total $67.7 billion, up from $54.5 billion last year, while on elementary school kids it will reach a total of $33.9 billion, up from $26.2 billion.
While many schools and colleges are still mulling reopening classrooms in September, 55% of shoppers expect students to take at least some of their classes at home this fall, with only 26% expecting most or all classes to be taught in-person, National Retail Federation (NRF) said.
""By any measure, this is an unprecedented year with great uncertainty, including how students will get their education this fall,"" NRF Chief Executive Officer Matthew Shay said.
""Parents ... know the value of an education and are navigating uncertainty and unknowns so that students are prepared.""
Of those expecting classes at home, 72% said they would buy computers, home furnishings or other supplies needed to study from home. A third said they would buy a laptop and more than a fifth said computer speakers or headphones.
The vast majority of consumers said the pandemic would change how they shop this year even as stores reopen, with 43% saying they plan to make purchases online rather than in-person.
Parents with children in elementary school through high school said they plan to spend an average $789.49 per family, topping last year's $696.70. College students expect to spend an average $1,059.20 per family, compared with last year's $976.78.

268,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 09:18AM ET</span>","Shadow Bank Weaknesses Forced Fed’s Market Rescue, Quarles Says","(Bloomberg) -- A top Federal Reserve official is issuing a warning about fast-growing and largely unregulated shadow lenders: They were a big factor in why central banks had to save markets earlier this year, and much more needs to be done to assess the risks posed by the sector.
The coronavirus crisis has exposed potential weaknesses tied to nonbank financial firms, including excessive leverage, interconnectedness and instances of assets freezing up that investors assumed were akin to cash, according to Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Randal Quarles. Such factors left central banks with no option other than intervening, he said, speaking in his capacity as chairman of the global Financial Stability Board.
“While extraordinary central bank interventions calmed capital markets, which remained open and enabled firms to raise new and longer-term financing, such measures should not be required,” Quarles wrote in letter dated Tuesday to his counterparts at other central banks. It’s “more important than ever” to understand the possible threats of nonbanks, he added.
In mid-March the Fed started rolling out emergency lending facilities focused on ultra-short-term credit markets that dried up as companies, banks and investors began hoarding cash. One of the quickest programs established was the Money Market Fund Liquidity Facility. It was crucial to restoring order because institutional investors began withdrawing rapidly from so-called prime money market funds, vehicles that invest partly in short-term company IOUs.
Since the disruption, at least one big provider of institutional prime money funds, Fidelity Investments, announced it would shut down those funds and steer customers mainly into funds that invest exclusively in government-backed securities. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren reacted by saying he hoped other fund providers would follow suit.

In his letter, Quarles also warned of the risk of renewed turmoil to financial markets, notwithstanding the unprecedented support already provided by policy makers.
“We may be seeing significant pricing disconnects between the market and economic fundamentals, which could result in sudden and sharp repricing,” Quarles wrote. “The impacts of these economic strains may be amplified in emerging markets, given the risks to their currency and debt markets from capital outflows.”
After plummeting in March with the onset of the pandemic, the S&P 500 has rebounded sharply and is closing in on levels that prevailed at the start of this year. U.S. unemployment, in contrast, is more than three times higher than it was before the Covid-19 outbreak, and now stands at 11.1%
Following the 2008 financial crisis, regulators and lawmakers imposed aggressive new limits on banks. But reforms such as the Dodd-Frank Act did little to boost oversight of nonbank firms that contributed to the meltdown. Agencies still have limited authority over investment funds, mortgage firms and insurers -- even as such firms have stepped up their activity in financial markets.

The FSB expects to conclude a review of the March turbulence by November, Quarles said. As international regulators get a better sense of the vulnerabilities, it’ll help them decide “where policy responses may be needed,” he said.

Several big global investors have joined environmental activists in urging EU nations and others to ensure plans to help their economies recover from the coronavirus crisis are sustainable and support Paris climate accord goals.
The EU's plans for a 750 billion euro recovery fund has won support from investors who say it would create safe euro zone assets to rival German government bonds. Issuing green bonds as well will make the plans more attractive, they add.
S&P estimated 225 billion euros of the fund could be raised via green bonds, basing its figure on last week's EU Commission proposal which said it 30% of the recovery funds would target climate-friendly projects.
The ratings agency said a green issuance of that scale would boost the size of the global green bond market by 89%. About $53 billion sovereign green bonds have been issued so far, it added.
Green bonds have so far made up just 3.7% of global bond issuance, making it ""difficult for central banks or regulators to ask market participants to build green bond portfolios"", the S&P economists said in their report. 
""The availability of an EU green safe asset could help investors, as well as policymakers, achieve their goals to 'green' their portfolios and the economy,"" they said, adding such an EU move could encourage private green bond issuance.
European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde opened the door last week for the bank to use its bond buying programme to pursue green objectives.
France believes it is possible to reach an EU deal on the recovery plan at the end of the week, the office of the French presidency said on Wednesday.

271,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>","U.S. Paycheck Protection hit some of its mark, but missed the most vulnerable","By Howard Schneider and Brad Heath
(Reuters) - The Paycheck Protection Program appears to have thrown a critical safety net under U.S. middle and upper-middle-wage jobs, but it faltered when it comes to lower-paying positions and the industries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, according to a Reuters analysis of loan details.
Analysis of data on nearly 4.9 million PPP loans released last week by the Trump administration showed the program, a subject of controversy because a number of larger well-connected borrowers tapped it even though it was designed to aid vulnerable small businesses, did partially hit its target. 
Separating U.S. industries into groups of around 60 each ranked by average annual pay, the Reuters analysis showed that employers in the middle of the wage scale received an outsized share of PPP loans both in dollar terms and the number of loans disbursed. 
The middle group includes a diverse set of industries such as automobile dealers, building electrical and heating installers, and freight trucking companies, representing around 16.5% of the U.S. workforce and a similar share of establishments. The group received roughly 25% of the more than $520 billion in PPP loans disbursed as of June 30, and around 20% of the number of loans
The next highest paid group, with average annual salaries near $74,000 and including doctor's offices, equipment wholesalers and accountants, included under 13% of the 101 million workers covered by the analysis, but received more than 18% of PPP loans. 
Parsing how many jobs were saved in each category is more difficult. For example, workers in the lowest wage category make on average just under $25,000 per year, so any given amount of funding would support more of their salaries.
Companies nationwide reported the money preserved some 51 million jobs overall, though a spot check by Reuters turned up numerous red flags, including large numbers of jobs recorded as saved with very small loans.
PPP loans are meant foremost as a way for businesses with 500 or fewer employees to cover payroll and are forgivable, in effect turning them into government grants, as long as most of the money is used to pay employees. 
Still, the program appears to have given proportionately less support to the lowest-wage industries, a group which includes restaurants, golf clubs and ski resorts and other leisure services hard hit by the coronavirus recession. Those industries represented roughly 38% of employees, but received less than a fourth of the PPP funds. The group also accounted for about 35% of U.S. small business establishments, but just around 30% of PPP loans.
For the analysis, Reuters divided industries into five groups ranked by annual salary using details from the first three months of 2019 from the U.S. Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. The first-quarter report for each year in the QCEW includes categories for the number of employees in each establishment, allowing those with more than 500 to be excluded, and average annual pay rates to be calculated for the rest.
Data for 2020 is not yet available.
MORE HELP NEEDED 
Despite questions on how the funds have been disbursed, economists and Federal Reserve officials have credited the PPP with helping keep disposable income from falling too sharply in recent months, and preventing the worst, Depression-style outcomes from occurring.
Recently released bankruptcy data for June buttress the point. Though the Chapter 13 bankruptcies used by larger firms to restructure their businesses were up 40% year to date from a year ago, overall business bankruptcy filings fell 13%.
""Businesses are saying we got PPP and it is allowing us to stay afloat,"" Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said last week, recounting conversations with entrepreneurs around his southern U.S. Fed district.
Yet, he said, the ""the smallest of the small"" businesses, particularly in towns and rural areas, may be at more risk, and more so among the restaurants and small shops important to downtown life outside of urban America.
That's a group he said that may need more help as the pandemic continues and officials debate what economic props to keep in place over time. There is still around $140 billion in PPP money available, but it is due to lapse within weeks, as are other coronavirus relief efforts approved earlier this year in legislation like the CARES Act. 
Policymakers have worried many employers in lower-paying and more vulnerable sectors appear to have forgone seeking PPP assistance because they either lacked banking relationships, found the rules confusing, or were uncomfortable with taking on debt even if it might be forgiven. Also some employers in that group may have reasoned that other pandemic assistance programs, such as enhanced unemployment benefits, were a better option for their staff and opted not to seek loans.
The data released last week by the Small Business Administration had some gaps. Specific loan amounts were not provided for transactions above $150,000, covering 282,164 loans, or 13.5% of the total. For those loans, Reuters used the average amount for each category. Industry codes were provided for almost all of the transactions.
Other U.S. data suggest the PPP did help prop up the economy, at least so far, even as it fell short of the loftiest aims. Some economists, for example, feel it has led to declines in unemployment claims, even though they remain high.
The manufacturing and construction industries in particular drew 10% and 12% of PPP dollars. Yet combined the two sectors account for less than 10% of the 14.7 million net jobs lost from February through June.

The leisure and hospitality industry, by contrast, absorbed more than a third of the net jobs lost so far during the pandemic, but received less than 10% of the PPP loans.

Investing.com -- Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and other banks pick up the baton in earnings season, with more pandemic-driven writedowns a near-certainty.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wins a key court decision in its tax case against the EU. Industrial production data for June are due and there may be more hints from the Fed about the need for further stimulus. And OPEC technical staff meet to map out a timeline for restoring oil supply to the world after the pandemic shock. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, July 15th.
1. Bank earnings, part 2 (Starring Goldman, BoNY & PNC)
Brace for another round of loan writedowns as Goldman Sachs, PNC Financial, US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) report their earnings for the last three months.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) all underperformed the broader market on Monday after taking a combined charge of $28 billion against possible and actual loan losses, overwhelmingly the result of the pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns.
However, the losses were cushioned by record gains on bond trading and better-than-expected investment banking business – something that Goldman in particular will be looking to emulate. PNC’s numbers and outlook, meanwhile, will be improved by the sale of its stake in Blackrock (NYSE:BLK).
2. Industrial production data due as dollar hits four-month low vs euro
It’s a heavy day for U.S. data, with industrial production and manufacturing output data due at 9:15 AM ET. That’ll come after weekly data on mortgage applications at 7 AM and the New York Empire State manufacturing index at 8:30 AM.
Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker is also due to speak, and the dollar may be susceptible to any further hints of the need for more monetary stimulus. Fed Governor Lael Brainard drove the dollar to a four-month low against the euro on Tuesday by suggesting that the Fed may need to pivot from a focus on ‘stabilizing’ the economy to something more ‘accommodative’.
Her comments are the latest from Fed officials expressing concern at signs that the rebound in economic activity is leveling out.
3 Stocks set to open higher; health, advertising updates due
U.S. stock markets are set to open, buoyed by the publication after Monday’s close of a study showing positive early-stage test results for Moderna’s experimental drug for treating Covid-19. Brainard's comments are also helping keep the mood upbeat.
By 6:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 253 points or 1.0%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 0.7% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.4%
In addition to the banks named above, there are also quarterly updates from UnitedHealth, advertising giant Omnicom and, after the closing bell, eBay. UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH)'s earnings came in ahead of expectations, but revenue fell short.
4. Apple's court victory on EU tax case
The European Union’s second-highest court struck down on appeal an antitrust ruling that would have forced Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to pay some $15 billion in tax back to the Irish government.
The court ruled that Competition Commissioner Magarete Vestager hadn’t proved that the sweetheart tax deal concluded between Apple and Ireland had been aimed at ensuring competitive advantage.
The ruling is a stinging defeat for the European Commission, which has had smaller successes against other U.S. and European companies in their aggressive exploitation of EU tax loopholes. It’s a victory not just for Apple, but for Ireland and other smaller EU members who have used such sweetheart deals to attract inward investment over the years.
5. OPEC staff meeting to advise on summer output levels 
A meeting of OPEC’s technical staff is expected to produce a more granular timetable for restoring supply to the world oil market as demand recovers from the pandemic shock.
According to newswire reports, the meeting, due to begin at 8 AM ET (1200 GMT), is likely to result in a recommendation that countries guilty of overproducing in the last three months – notably Iraq, Nigeria and Angola - compensate for that by cutting output further over the next two.
The net effect would be that total supply increases in August by less than the 2 million barrels a day foreseen under the current ’OPEC+’ deal – a mildly bullish outcome. The recommendations will still need to be ratified by ministers, however.
U.S. crude prices were steady above $40 on the back of a sharp drop in U.S. inventories reported by the American Petroleum Institute late on Tuesday. The U.S. government’s weekly data are due at 10:30 AM ET."
274,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 06:11AM ET</span>",Spanish PM sees 'very difficult hours ahead' as EU summit nears,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he saw ""very difficult hours ahead"" as he visited his Swedish counterpart Stefan Lofven for talks ahead of an EU summit to agree stimulus measures to boost pandemic-hit European economies.
EU leaders are due to meet later this week to haggle over the stimulus plans, but their first face-to-face summit since the lockdowns began in March is expected to be fraught with division.
Sweden, one of the bloc's ""Frugal Four"", wants a proposed recovery fund to distribute loans rather than grants, while also seeking a smaller long-term EU budget, positions that have pitted it against countries such as Spain. 
""We have different views on the answer to the crisis, but we share a common goal,"" Sanchez told a news conference at the Swedish government's countryside residence Harpsund. ""If we delay the response we delay the recovery and the crisis could get worse. We all have to make some sacrifices to reach an agreement."" 
Leaders of the bloc have held a flurry of one-on-one meetings to persuade thrifty Sweden, the Netherlands, Austria and Denmark to drop their opposition to the 750 billion euro ($850 billion) recovery fund proposal.
Asked about prospects for an agreement in July, Lofven said: ""It is complicated, we need to acknowledge it is complex and will be tough, but it is not impossible"".
""You need to be prepared to change and that needs to be from both directions. But at the same time all countries have their limits. So we have to find a bridge,"" he said.

Under the Commission proposal, which is backed by Germany and France as well as southern countries such as Spain and Italy that are seeking funds to rebuild their hard-hit economies, two-thirds of the recovery fund would be in the form of grants.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Amid political turmoil in financial hub Hong Kong, Taiwan is pitching investors its democracy, rule of law and high quality of life as the island aims to draw more foreign money and talent, Taiwan's top financial regulator said on Wednesday.
Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman Huang Tien-mu told Reuters it has been in discussions with foreign financial institutions about increasing their investments and operations in Taiwan, and have had ""positive reactions"" from not only Hong Kong but also the United States and other countries.
""This has been ongoing. It's not only aimed at Hong Kong,"" Huang said in his first interview with foreign media since being appointed to the post in late May.
The commission has been pushing financial reform to attract money and talent from around the region, and to bring Taiwan's financial system in line with international standards, he said.
""Our main aim is not to replace any particular region or city,"" Huang added, when asked if China's new national security law for Hong Kong was an opportunity for Taiwan to supplant the city as Asia's financial centre.
""We hope to attract not only people or funds from one place. We hope to make Taiwan's market even more competitive, so it becomes a financial market that gets more attention in Asia.""
Chinese-claimed and democratic Taiwan has condemned the new law, and anti-government protesters in the former British colony have won widespread and cross-party support on the island. 
Taiwan opened an office this month to help people fleeing Hong Kong after China imposed the security law on the city, with a senior minister saying at the time Taiwan hoped to seize the opportunity to attract professionals and capital from the city.
But Huang, 61, said problems include Taiwan's more complex tax system, lower salaries, lack of wide usage of English and financial regulations that may be relatively liberal but are not as free as other parts of the world.
""In the short term, this is perhaps not something we can be like others with,"" added Huang, who started his career in Taiwan's Finance Ministry and has a doctorate from the University of Southern California.
""But Taiwan has its attractions. Our democratic system, rule of law that is transparent,"" Huang said, pointing to its freedom of speech, ability to elect its own leaders and even legalising of same-sex marriage.

""I've been to many international meetings, and I feel that everyone likes Taiwan - they feel very relaxed when they come here.""

""Behavioural responses mean that the UK economic outlook will continue to depend on the global and domestic spread of COVID-19,"" Tenreyro said. 
""Assuming prevalence gradually falls, my central case forecast is for GDP to follow an interrupted or incomplete 'V-shaped' trajectory, with the first quarterly step-up in Q3.""
Tenreyro was one of the eight members of the BoE's nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee who voted to increase the central bank's bond-buying programme by 100 billion pounds ($126 billion) last month.
BoE Chief Economist Andy Haldane, who cast the lone vote against more stimulus, has described the shape of the recovery as ""so far, so V"", although he warned there were big risks to the outlook from an expected jump in unemployment.
Data published on Tuesday showed Britain's gross domestic product grew by a slower than expected 1.8% in May from April, when it slumped by 20%. The government's budget forecasters said the economy could shrink by as much as 14.3% this year.
Tenreyro said she was not putting much importance on May's weak GDP growth figure and spelled out what she believed would be an initial bounce-back followed by a slowdown.
""We are already seeing indications of a sharp recovery in purchases that were restricted only because of mandated business closures,"" said in a speech during an online event organised by the London School of Economics.
""But I think that this will be interrupted by continued risk aversion and voluntary social distancing in some sectors, remaining restrictions on activities in others, and in general, by higher unemployment.""
Tuesday's projections by the Office for Budget Responsibility saw the unemployment rate rising as high as 13%from just under 4% in the most recent reading. 
Tenreyro said downward pressure on inflation was likely to persist for sometime and cited ""considerable downside risks"" for demand. ""I remain ready to vote for further action as necessary to support the economy,"" she said.
The BoE's next policy decision is due to be announced on Aug. 6.

Some 26% of small and medium-sized businesses surveyed by Facebook (O:FB), in partnership with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the World Bank, said they had closed between January and May 2020. The survey polled more than 30,000 small business leaders from more than 50 countries.
Out of the businesses that remained operational when the survey was conducted, on May 28-31, nearly two in three cited lower sales in the previous 30 days compared with the same time a year earlier. 
To deal with what the report called ""the challenge of a lifetime"", a third of smaller businesses surveyed that were in operation during the poll said they had reduced their labour force.
""The COVID-19 pandemic isn't just a public health emergency; it's also an economic crisis that is hitting small and medium-sized businesses exceptionally hard,"" according to the report.
Small and medium-sized firms with a business page on Facebook were surveyed in the first of a series of six-monthly data collections aimed at examining the impact of the pandemic on smaller enterprises.
The coronavirus outbreak forced governments globally to impose lockdown measures this year, crippling economic activity and tipping some economies into recession. The International Monetary Fund said in June it expects global output to shrink 4.9% in 2020.
The survey said consumer-focused sectors were hit the hardest. Some 54% of tourism agencies and 47% of smaller businesses working in hospitality and events management said they were closed at the time of the survey.
Businesses led by women were more likely to be closed at the time of the survey than those led by men.
""Not only do a greater proportion of female business leaders operate micro-businesses with no employees, but female-led SMBs (small businesses) are also concentrated in the sectors that have been most affected by lockdown measures,"" the report said.

278,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>","BOJ stands pat on policy, sticks to cautious recovery view","By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady on Wednesday and maintained its view that the economy would gradually emerge from the coronavirus pandemic's devastating blow, signalling a pause after delivering stimulus twice so far this year.
But it warned that uncertainty over the outlook was ""extremely high"" due to various risks, including the possibility of a huge second wave of infections and potential disruptions to the banking system.
""Japan's economy is expected to gradually improve from the latter half of this year. But the pace of recovery will be moderate as the effect of the global coronavirus pandemic will remain,"" the BOJ said in a quarterly outlook report.
As widely expected, the BOJ maintained its -0.1% short-term interest rate target and a pledge to cap 10-year government bond yields around zero.
It also made no changes to its asset-buying and lending programmes for easing corporate funding strains.
""There isn't any way for monetary policy to stimulate economic conditions right now. I don't think the BOJ can do anything at this stage apart from providing cash flow support so that (conditions) don't worsen further,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
In fresh quarterly forecasts, the BOJ expects the economy to shrink 4.7% in the current year ending in March, from a range of -5.0% to -3.0% projected in April, before expanding 3.3% the following year.
Consumer prices were forecast to fall 0.5% this year and stay well below its 2% target through early 2023.
BANKING, PRICE UNCERTAINTIES LOOM
The BOJ loosened policy in March and April focusing on steps to ease tight liquidity, such as boosting asset purchases and creating a lending scheme as the pandemic hurt jobs, spending and depressed business activity.
A Reuters tankan survey on Wednesday showed Japanese manufacturers' mood remained close to the most pessimistic they have been in 11 years in July though some firms, in particular those from the service sector, believed conditions would be less negative in the next few months.
The global spread of coronavirus and risk of rising infections in Japan could also hamper the recovery. Tokyo is considering raising its alert for coronavirus after a spike in cases to record numbers in the capital.
While the BOJ has said rate cuts would be among options if it needed to stimulate the economy, analysts warn that doing so could hurt commercial banks' profits and their ability to lend.
The emphasis on credit easing to battle the crisis has also cast doubt on the relevance of yield curve control, a framework that sets interest rates as its main policy target.
In a sign of its concern over financial stability, the BOJ warned in the report that prolonged pressure on financial institutions' profits could discourage them from lending and prod them to take on excessive risk in search for yields.
There was also uncertainty on how the pandemic could affect corporate price-setting behaviour, as firms are caught between cutting prices due to weak demand and passing on rising costs from supply constraints to consumers, the report said.

BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may offer some clues on how the pandemic could reshape the central bank's policy framework at his post-meeting news conference scheduled for 3:30 p.m. (0630GMT).
 
"
279,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 12:00AM ET</span>","BOJ Sits Tight on Policy, Offers More Clarity on Projections","(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Japan left its monetary stimulus untouched Wednesday, while painting a gloomier picture of the economy this year as it signaled it doesn’t see a quick recovery from the pandemic.
The BOJ kept its short-term interest rate at -0.1%, its 10-year yield target around zero and left its asset purchases unchanged. Some 96% of economists surveyed before the decision predicted the central bank wouldn’t add to its stimulus at the meeting.
The bank released updated price and growth projections with median forecasts, having skipped pinpoint figures in April. The latest predictions point to a deeper slump this year, but suggest a slightly faster pickup in the following years.
Earlier this month, people familiar with the matter said the board doesn’t see a need to act further at this point as financial markets are relatively calm and businesses aren’t facing severe funding problems. Recent data also signal the recession likely bottomed last quarter.
Even though Japan has faced a far less deadly COVID-19 outbreak than in Europe and the U.S., a recent rise in Tokyo cases continues to weigh on sentiment and inflation has fallen below zero. The country’s manufacturers are also heavily reliant on demand from markets where the pandemic rages on.
The board said it sees the economy shrinking 4.7% in the 12 months through March 2021. In April, it saw a contraction of somewhere between 3% and 5%. The return of a median projection suggests that the bank is now less uncertain about the path ahead.
On inflation, the BOJ forecast prices falling 0.5% this fiscal year, near the middle of the range given last quarter.
The bank said it still sees price growth returning next fiscal year, but doesn’t see inflation rising anywhere near its 2% target for the foreseeable future -- another signal that Governor Kuroda and his colleagues are unlikely to raise interest rates before his term ends in April 2023.
What Bloomberg’s Economist Says
“Barring a second wave of virus infections or substantial shock to financial markets, we expect the BOJ to stay on hold for the time being.”
--Yuki Masujima, economist

The BOJ has now refrained from further policy action at its two most recent regular meetings, following a flurry of action during the early days of the pandemic when it expanded purchases of corporate bonds and stock funds, pledged to buy as much government debt as needed to keep yields low and introduced two lending programs for struggling companies.
More than 90% of economists surveyed by Bloomberg this month said the BOJ has done enough, or more than enough, so far to support the economy. Some 63% now see the bank standing pat through 2020, up from 38% just last month.
The BOJ, along with the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, has emphasized its readiness to do more and reiterated that the immediate focus is on securing financing for companies and market stability.
Last month, the BOJ estimated the size of its two special funding programs for struggling companies at 90 trillion yen. The outstanding amount of loans under the programs was 22.6 trillion yen, according to the central bank last week. Japan’s bank lending rose at the fastest pace in almost three decades last month, partly due to those programs.
While bankruptcies rose 6.3% in June from a year earlier and unemployment increased to 2.9% in May, the figures suggest that central bank and government efforts are helping to limit the damage from the crisis. The uptick in the jobless rate is far smaller than the spikes seen in other developed economies.
Still, the BOJ will continue monitoring the impact of Covid-19 on businesses, especially smaller ones that employ most of Japan’s workforce.
“A number of companies may not be able to absorb the shock from a decline in revenues,” said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. “To prevent bankruptcies and unemployment, the BOJ will need to continue to take action for the funding of companies and the stability of financial markets.”
For now, the BOJ still has scope to inject more money into markets without changing its policy. Its purchases of exchange traded funds were just under an annualized pace of 7 trillion yen last month, far from its ceiling of 12 trillion yen, Bloomberg calculations show.
The BOJ held 4.3 trillion yen of commercial paper and 4.4 trillion yen of corporate bonds as of July 10; both holdings are less than a half of the central bank’s raised limits.

280,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 11:05PM ET</span>",Internal U.S. small business watchdog launches inquiry into duplicate pandemic loans,"By Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Small Business Administration's internal watchdog has launched an inquiry into a technical glitch that led many small businesses to receive duplicate loans through a high-profile federal coronavirus aid program.
A spokesman for the SBA Office of the Inspector General confirmed that the office has begun a review of the issue, which Reuters reported last month may have led to hundreds of millions of dollars in duplicate loans being approved under the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).
The review comes after U.S. Representative James Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat who is chairman of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, pressed the SBA watchdog in a letter to investigate the issue, citing the Reuters report. 
The duplicate loan issue may have created ""significant opportunities"" for fraud and potentially wasted more than $100 million in taxpayer dollars, Clyburn said in the June 23 letter addressed to SBA Inspector General Hannibal ""Mike"" Ware. He said it was ""critical"" to probe the issue as soon as possible.
Representatives of the SBA did not respond immediately to a request for comment on Tuesday. 
The SBA launched the program on April 3 to help keep workers at struggling businesses employed. In the race to get funds out the door, the program encountered paperwork, technology and fairness issues. 
In the case of the duplicate loan approvals, a blind spot in SBA's loan processing system failed to catch when some borrowers submitted applications multiple times, typically through different lenders, Reuters reported. 
Lenders are still grappling with unwinding duplicate loans across several banks and retrieving the cash where those loans have been deposited, according to one person with direct knowledge of the matter. 

The government has said it will only guarantee one loan per borrower, which means lenders, rather than the taxpayer, are likely to be on the hook for the error.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday shut the door on ""Phase 2"" trade negotiations with China, saying he does not want to talk to Beijing about trade because of the coronavirus pandemic.
""I'm not interested right now in talking to China,"" Trump replied when asked in an interview with CBS News whether Phase 2 trade talks were dead.
""We made a great trade deal,"" Trump said, of the Phase 1 agreement signed in January. ""But as soon as the deal was done, the ink wasn't even dry, and they hit us with the plague,"" he said, referring to the novel coronavirus, which first emerged from the Chinese city of Wuhan.
For months, Trump has blamed China for sending the coronavirus to the United States, saying that China must be ""held accountable"" for failing to contain the disease. The pandemic has taken a stiff toll on the U.S. economy, endangering Trump's hopes for re-election in November. China pledged to increase purchases of U.S. farm and manufactured goods, energy and services by $200 billion over two years as part of the Phase 1 trade deal, but Trump has said the pandemic changed his views on the agreement. 
At the White House, Trump announced that he signed legislation and an executive order to hold China accountable for the ""oppressive"" national security law it imposed on Hong Kong.
The measure approved by Congress, the latest in a series of moves aimed at ratcheting up pressure on Beijing, gives Trump's administration the authority to penalize banks doing business with Chinese officials who implement Beijing’s new national security law on Hong Kong.
Trump said he has no plans to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Even before the coronavirus pandemic began, few trade watchers in Washington were expecting https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-phasetwo/no-phase-two-u-s-china-deal-on-the-horizon-officials-say-idUSKBN1XZ00H Phase 2 negotiations to bear fruit before the 2020 election.

While Phase 1 focused mainly on Chinese purchases of U.S. goods, improved U.S. access to China's financial services market and some intellectual property issues, Phase 2 was meant to tackle far more difficult issues associated with China's technology transfer policies, industrial espionage and government subsidies to state-owned enterprises.

282,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",China Set to Post Return to Growth After Easing Virus Lockdowns,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy is set to post a return to growth for the second quarter, with a range of indicators due Thursday to confirm the upward trend as the nation slowly climbs out of the virus-induced slump.
Gross domestic product is forecast to have expanded 2.2% in the three months to June, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That reverses the historic decline of 6.8% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year.
The steady resumption of growth in the Chinese economy will be a signal for a world still mired in an accelerating pandemic that the virus can be contained and output can recover. At the same time, China remains vulnerable to the effects of demand-sapping containment measures elsewhere, and local consumer confidence is fragile.
“Since mid-March, China’s economy has staged an impressive comeback, bolstered by pent-up demand, a catch-up in production, a surge in medical product exports and stimulus in both China and other major economies that has bolstered demand for goods made in China,” Wang Tao, chief China economist at UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) in Hong Kong, wrote in a note.
Industrial output likely continued to lead the rebound in June, jumping 4.8% from a year earlier, survey results showed.
Fixed-asset investment in the first six months is expected to decline 3.3%, a much slower pace than previously. Retail sales, the weak link in China’s fragile recovery, is projected to have grown for the first time since the pandemic, expanding by 0.5% on the year.
However, for the first six months of the year, none of the main indicators are forecast to have recovered the level they were at in June 2019, showing how hard it will be to climb out of the deep slump. GDP is forecast to have shrunk 2.4% compared to the first six months of 2019.
The pace of China’s recovery will depend to an extent on the effectiveness of the moderate stimulus measures rolled out so far. The government has earmarked a record 3.75 trillion yuan ($534 billion) in special local government bonds this year, most of which will be channeled to infrastructure projects. However, infrastructure investment has so far remained a drag on growth, while property investment is expected to have returned to expansion, despite Beijing’s reluctance to further support the property market.
“The economic recovery has been slow domestically due to the unexpectedly slow kick-off of infrastructure investments,” said Iris Pang, chief economist for greater China at ING Bank NV. “The slow growth in infrastructure investments is dragging on growth, and is very damaging on future economic growth as jobless rates would increase with a slow recovery, and then will feed back into the economy with shrinking consumption.”
Uneven Recovery
While the incremental recovery has demonstrated the resilience in the world’s second-largest economy, it remains an uneven one, mainly driven by supply rather than demand. Industrial production growth has already returned to pre-virus levels with the possibility to rise further, but consumers have so far stayed wary as small outbreaks within the country and shrinking income hurt sentiment.
That unevenness can also be seen in the gap between the state and private sector, with the former receiving more resources. However, domestic demand is picking up faster than external demand, with China being the first to reopen most of its economy and the rest of the world still largely under lock-downs.
Uncertainty and Headwinds
Looking ahead, the recovery momentum may weaken on rising uncertainty and strong headwinds.
Pent-up demand that has supported growth in the second quarter will naturally lose some steam. Exports that have been bolstered by demand for medical equipment may fall significantly when production catches up overseas. Rising trade tensions could also hit China’s exports and export-related manufacturing investment.
The risks of a second wave will also linger. The recent resurgence of cases in Beijing triggered a re-imposition of restrictions, and sporadic cases around the country continue to occur.
Serious floods in southern China could threaten to wipe out much of the country’s output this summer, with 27 provinces being hit to some extent and the current direct losses standing at 61.8 billion yuan, according to state media.
Considering the other factors weighing on growth, including unemployment and deflation pressure, a reversal from the current accommodative policy stance is unlikely.
“Despite the strong recovery between March and mid-June, we believe a full economic recovery remains distant,” Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura International Ltd in Hong Kong, wrote in a note. “It is too early for Beijing to reverse its easing stance.”
Global Implications
As the country first hit by the coronavirus pandemic and first to climb out of the slump, China’s recovery still implies a brighter outlook for the rest of the world ahead if the pandemic can be arrested.
“China is showing that the virus can be contained, but the trade-off has been very tight pandemic mitigation policies, among the tightest across major economies,” said Shaun Roache, Asia-Pacific chief economist at S&P Global Ratings. “The lesson here is that virus containment is not enough to drive a quick rebound and that we may have to wait for a lasting medical solution to truly get back to business-as-usual.”

283,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 06:06PM ET</span>",Fed officials warn on 'thick fog' ahead for U.S. economy as recovery concerns deepen,"By Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Dunsmuir and Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy will recover more slowly than expected amid a surge in novel coronavirus cases across the country, and a broad second wave of the disease could cause economic pain to deepen again, Federal Reserve officials warned on Tuesday.
One by one, Fed policymakers have become more downbeat in recent days, resetting expectations on the recovery and cautioning that recent improvements in economic data such as job gains may be fleeting.
""The pandemic remains the key driver of the economy's course. A thick fog of uncertainty still surrounds us, and downside risks predominate,"" Fed Governor Lael Brainard said in a speech to a virtual event hosted by the National Association for Business Economics.
She called on the U.S. central bank to commit to providing sustained accommodation through forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, and said additional fiscal support would be ""vital"" to the strength of the recovery - particularly with the first round of pandemic economic support programs expiring soon.
Since March, the Fed has slashed interest rates to near zero, ramped up large-scale asset purchases and launched numerous other crisis programs designed to grease the U.S. financial system and funnel credit to households and businesses.
U.S. coronavirus cases rose in 46 out of 50 states last week and deaths rose nationally for the first time since mid-April, according to a Reuters analysis.
The president of the Richmond Fed, Thomas Barkin, warned on Tuesday that U.S. unemployment could rise again as businesses adjust to a recession likely to be longer than first anticipated and initiatives like the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) expire.
""A bunch of companies large and small are realizing this is not a two-month issue and recasting their business,"" possibly jeopardizing two strong months of job growth, Barkin said in webcast remarks to the Charlotte Rotary Club. 
Small-business recipients of PPP loans that may have kept employees on to meet the terms of loan forgiveness may now consider laying them off as the program expires and demand remains weak. 
Robert Kaplan, president of the Dallas Fed, speaking on CNBC, cited ""lots of overcapacity in the economy,"" which he called ""disinflationary.""
Fed officials, after initially hoping the virus would be brought swiftly under control in the United States to allow the economy to bounce back quickly, admitted that the forecasts for economic growth made at their last policy meeting in June largely did not factor in the possibility of a second wave. 
The renewed surge in cases has prompted some states to dial back or pause reopenings at a time when other advanced nations around the world have been able to reopen their economies more sustainably due to successful mitigation strategies.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, also at the webinar organized by the Fed, said the increase in cases could cause more damage to the economy and to consumer confidence.
James Bullard, the St. Louis Fed president, sounded a somewhat optimistic note, saying his base case is the economy continues to grow in the second half of the year, but still offered caution. ""The downside risk is nevertheless substantial, and better execution of a granular, risk-based policy will be critical to keep the economy out of depression,"" Bullard said in comments to the Economic Club of New York. He expects Congress by the end of the month to approve a ""substantial"" new fiscal package to keep households and businesses stable. 
Brainard warned that a broad second wave of infections could even prompt a second dip in activity as well as reignite financial market volatility at a time of greater vulnerability.

""Nonbank financial institutions could again come under pressure ... and some banks might pull back on lending if they face rising losses,"" Brainard said.
 
"
284,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 04:20PM ET</span>",Bullard: Expects fresh fiscal package this month to extend pandemic support,"(Reuters) - St. Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard said on Tuesday he expects the U.S. Congress to approve new economic programs by the end of the month to keep businesses and households afloat and avoid an approaching ""fiscal cliff.""
The expiry this month of extended unemployment benefits and other programs raised the risk that spending power could be drained from the U.S. economy even as coronavirus cases surge and millions or workers wait to be called back to the job.

But ""there will be a bill and it will be substantial,"" Bullard predicted.

James attributed the estimated deficit to the government's emergency spending to support the businesses and individuals suffering from COVID-19 lockdowns and a significant drop in revenues due to the pandemic.

286,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 03:40PM ET</span>",Fed's Harker says U.S. economic downturn is painful and 'stubbornly long-lasting',"(Reuters) - Months after the coronavirus arrived in the United States, the economy remains ""mired"" in crisis and policymakers need to create solutions that offer better support to struggling small businesses, Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker said on Tuesday.
""Indeed, even as the economy is reopening in fits and starts, the pandemic’s effects are proving not to be just a brief setback,"" Harker said in remarks prepared for a webinar on small businesses organized by the Fed. ""We are in a downturn that is both exceptionally painful and stubbornly long-lasting.""
Harker said the Paycheck Protection Program, which offered loans to small businesses that could be converted to grants, was an ""immense help"" to millions of businesses. But the Fed official called the program a ""blunt instrument,"" saying it fell short when it came to aiding businesses in areas hit hard by the virus. 
For example, the state of Nebraska, which was less affected by the virus, received a higher rate of PPP loans than states such as New York, New Jersey or Pennsylvania, which were harder hit by the virus, he said. Part of the problem is that many of the smallest businesses in affected areas faced a harder time applying for the program because they did not have existing banking relationships, Harker said. 
""And so, when PPP loans became available, these business owners had no ability to access them,"" Harker said. ""This is a problem that has disproportionately affected racial minorities and communities of color.""

Research from the Philadelphia Fed found that small business employees who lost jobs because of the pandemic were disproportionately people in racial or ethnic minorities, and more likely to be young and less educated, he said.

288,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 02:55PM ET</span>","U.S. public schools, focus of debate on reopening, are unsung economic force","By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As the debate rages over how to safely reopen U.S. schools this autumn, one factor weighs heavily: the nation's 98,000 public ""K-12"" schools are a cornerstone of the economy, and a massive jobs engine. 
Nearly 51 million American kids attend (https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372#PK12_enrollment) public elementary, middle and high schools, compared to about six million in private schools. The educated workforce and childcare the system creates have been key drivers of economic growth. 
With a total workforce of about eight million Americans before the pandemic, kindergarten through 12th grade public education is also one of the largest U.S. employment sectors, exceeding construction, hospitals, finance and insurance and transportation and warehousing. 
Total expenditures for these schools were $721 billion during the 2018 fiscal year, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. (https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2018/econ/school-finances/secondary-education-finance.html) 
That is more than the U.S. Defense Department's $671 billion budget that year, or the Pentagon's $705 billion request for fiscal 2021.
The Trump administration, including U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, has been pushing for schools to physically reopen in the fall as U.S. coronavirus deaths near 140,000 (https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-USA/0100B5K8423/index.html), the world's highest. But it has not embraced any blueprint, including federal health guidelines, for how to do that safely. 
Parents, teachers and local governments are expressing growing concern, after a string of coronavirus outbreaks at day care and summer school classrooms around the country. 
On Monday, Los Angeles and San Diego said (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-schools-california/la-and-san-diego-schools-to-resume-online-only-instruction-in-august-idUSKCN24E2OD) their 700,000-student public K-12 schools would start online-only education in August, citing ""skyrocketing"" coronavirus infection rates in California. 
LOCAL DECISION 
The White House has little real sway over whether public schools will reopen - just about 8% of U.S. K-12 public school funding comes from the federal government, with the remainder split fairly evenly between state and local governments, the Census Bureau data shows.
The Department of Education says public school spending is heavily skewed toward salaries and benefits, which made up 80% of the per-pupil total spending of $12,612 in 2018. About 11% goes to purchased services and 7% to supplies.
Maintaining these jobs is particularly important for local communities because of the economic multiplier effect, said Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. That $721 billion in public school spending in 2018 translated to about $1.08 trillion in direct GDP output, she calculates, not including the economic benefits of better-educated workers. 
Although it rebounded somewhat in June, local government education employment is still down by 667,000 since March, when schools shifted largely to online instruction, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show.
That is nearly double the 351,000 jobs lost in local school districts after the 2008-2009 financial crisis, when tax revenues and budgets withered. 
The losses could increase without federal aid to state and local governments, Gould said. ""They're faced with austerity and severe cuts and education is one of the places they look.""
Many of those laid off, including teaching assistants, counselors, and maintenance workers, are likely supported by enhanced unemployment benefits, scheduled to expire (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-cliff-analysis/a-cash-cliff-spells-trouble-for-u-s-unemployed-and-everyone-else-idUSKBN24014U) at the end of July.
It is difficult to say how much school shutdowns in the fall would affect the U.S. economy. Analysis from Washington-based think tanks has focused on the long-term cost to the U.S. economy of a less skilled workforce in years to come due to school closures. But there is little data to show how closures in the fall would impact U.S. jobs and the GDP immediately.
WHO'S WATCHING THE KIDS? 
Online-only K-12 education or closed schools may pull parents, and especially women, out of the workforce, particularly those with very young children that need more supervision.
According to a recent McKinsey & Co report (https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/social-sector/our-insights/safely-back-to-school-after-coronavirus-closures#) on reopening schools, about 26.8 million Americans, or about 16% of the workforce, are dependent on child care in order to work.
Physically opening schools a few days a week, as has been proposed in New York City, will not help much without more federal aid for child care, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education and public policy at the University of California-Berkeley.
""This cost would be offset by the surge in labor supply and income, as parents flock back to work, helping to jump-start the economy,"" Fuller said.
DeVos told CNN on Sunday that because children contract the virus at a far lower rate than adults, there is little danger for them to be back in schools. 
""We know that schools across the country look very different and that there's not going to be a one-size-fits-all approach to everything,"" DeVos told Fox News Sunday.
Despite the threat to their jobs, teachers are not pushing to reopen schools. A USA Today poll (https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2020/05/26/coronavirus-schools-teachers-poll-ipsos-parents-fall-online/5254729002) at the end of May revealed that one in five teachers said they were unlikely to return to their classrooms in the fall. 

A Kaiser Family Foundation study (https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/how-many-teachers-are-at-risk-of-serious-illness-if-infected-with-coronavirus) found that nearly 1.5 million U.S. teachers, almost one in four, were at greater risk of serious illness if infected with the coronavirus due to age or existing health conditions.

Bullard said his base case is that the economy continues to grow in the second half of the year and build off of the surprise increases in employment in May and June.
But ""the downside risk is nevertheless substantial, and better execution of a granular, risk-based policy will be critical to keep the economy out of depression,"" Bullard said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia warned on Tuesday that Washington could respond with sanctions against Chinese officials and enterprises involved in coercion in the South China Sea after the United States announced a tougher stance to Beijing's claims there.
""Nothing is off the table ... there is room for that. This is a language the Chinese understand - demonstrative and tangible action,"" David Stilwell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia, told a Washington think tank when asked if sanctions were a possible U.S. response to Chinese actions. 
Stilwell spoke a day after Washington rejected China's claims to offshore resources in most of the South China Sea as ""completely unlawful,"" a stance denounced by Beijing.
Washington has long opposed China's expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea and has sent warships regularly through the strategic waterway, through which about $3 trillion of trade passes each year, to demonstrate freedom of navigation. 
But Monday's announcement was the first time it declared Chinese claims illegal.
China claims 90% of the potentially energy-rich sea, but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also claim parts of it. Beijing has built bases on atolls in the region but says its intentions are peaceful.
Greg Poling, a South China Sea expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said declaring Chinese claims illegal opened the way for a tougher U.S. response, such as through sanctions, and could also lead to more U.S. naval presence operations.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian condemned the U.S. move, saying it ""destroys regional peace and stability and is an irresponsible act.""
A U.S. Navy destroyer carried out a freedom of navigation operation on Tuesday near the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, the military said. 
""This freedom of navigation operation upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognized in international law by challenging the restrictions on innocent passage imposed by China, Vietnam, and Taiwan,"" the Navy said. 
Such operations have been increasingly common in recent years. 
The U.S.-China relationship has grown increasingly tense recently over various issues, including China's handling of the novel coronavirus and its tightened grip on Hong Kong.
Stilwell said the tougher U.S. position meant ""we are no longer going to say we are neutral on these maritime issues.""
""When a (Chinese) drilling rig plants itself in Vietnamese or Malaysian waters, we're going to be able to make a positive statement,” he said.
Stilwell had a particular warning over the Scarborough Shoal, a strategic outcrop 200 km (124 miles) from the Philippines claimed by Beijing and Manila that China seized in 2012.

""Any move by (China) to physically occupy, reclaim or militarize Scarborough Shoal would be a dangerous move ... and would have lasting and severe consequences for (China's)relationship with the United States, as well as the entire region,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - There is a great deal of uncertainty about the path ahead for the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve should use forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases for a ""sustained"" period in order to help the recovery, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said on Tuesday, as she offered a downbeat assessment of the risks ahead.
""The pandemic remains the key driver of the economy's course. A thick fog of uncertainty still surrounds us, and downside risks predominate,"" Brainard said in prepared remarks to a virtual event hosted by the National Association for Business Economics.
""The recovery likely will face headwinds for some time, calling for a sustained commitment to accommodation, along with additional fiscal support,"" she added.
The U.S. central bank has since March slashed interest rates to near zero, ramped up large-scale asset purchases and launched numerous other crisis programs designed to grease the U.S. financial system and funnel credit to households and businesses.
At the Fed's last meeting, policymakers discussed reviving a Great Recession-era promise to keep interest rates low until certain conditions are met, such as inflation meeting or even modestly exceeding the Fed's 2% inflation goal.
In her remarks, Brainard noted that yield curve control may also be appropriate at some point, but would require further analysis and discussion.
U.S. coronavirus cases rose in 46 out of 50 states last week and deaths rose nationally for the first time since mid-April, according to a Reuters analysis.
Fed officials, who initially hoped that the virus would be brought swiftly under control in the United States to allow the economy to recover more quickly, have voiced growing concern that the economic outlook will likely now be hobbled for years to come.
The renewed surge in cases has prompted some states to dial back or pause reopenings at a time when other advanced nations around the world have been able to reopen their economies more sustainably due to successful mitigation strategies. 
Brainard warned a broad second wave could weigh on the recovery and even prompt a second dip in activity as well as reignite financial market volatility at a time of greater vulnerability.

""Nonbank financial institutions could again come under pressure...and some banks might pull back on lending if they face rising losses,"" Brainard said.

""There is a complicated brew of what's happening on unemployment...A bunch of companies large and small are realizing this is not a two-month issue and recasting their business,"" possibly jeopardizing two strong months of job growth, Barkin said in webcast remarks to the Charlotte Rotary Club. Small business recipients of PPP loans, meanwhile, may have kept employees on staff to meet the terms of loan forgiveness, but may now consider laying them off as the program expires and demand remains weak.

""It would be desirable to reach a quick result but I don't know whether there will be success on Friday and Saturday,"" Merkel said during a news conference with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. ""Time is pressing.""
Merkel reiterated that there is no guarantee EU leaders will bridge their differences on the proposals by European Council President Charles Michel, designed to lift the bloc out of its worst economic crisis since World War Two at the summit on July 17-18.
Michel faces the daunting task of narrowing differences between the wealthy, thrifty north and the high-debt south, hit harder by COVID-19, over how to respond to the coronavirus crisis.
He has presented a long-term EU budget of 1.074 trillion euros and a recovery fund of 750 billion euros for pandemic-hammered economies, with two-thirds of that to be in the form of free grants and a third issued as repayable loans.
The Netherlands insists on conditioning access to the funds on economic reforms, something southern countries like Italy and Spain are eager to avoid.
Sanchez said Spain would do its best to secure a deal this week. Merkel has suggested that a second summit will be needed if leaders fail to seal a deal on Friday and Saturday.
""The deal must be in July,"" said Sanchez. ""Spain will do all it can to make it happen.""
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte warned during a news conference with Merkel on Monday that EU economic stimulus for member states should not carry too much conditionality.

Conte said Italy was happy for EU institutions to monitor its economic reforms but imposing excessively stringent conditions would be counter-productive.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's restaurants are counting the days to the country's notoriously cold and long winters, knowing that patio dining - which many are relying on as the coronavirus pandemic has limited indoor dining - is only a short-term solution, executives said.
Even after a bounceback in June, the food service industry has lost a third of its 1.2 million direct jobs due to lockdowns aimed at curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus. It is on track to lose C$44.8 billion ($33 billion) in revenue in 2020 compared with last year, according to Restaurants Canada, the industry lobby group.
As restaurants across the country slowly reopen, diners have been flocking to outdoor dining. Restaurants in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, recently opened their outdoor patios for service, with socially distanced indoor dining starting on Saturday in some parts of the province.
Several jurisdictions, including British Columbia and the cities of Edmonton in Alberta and Toronto in Ontario, have made it easier for restaurants to open patios, encouraging diners to eat outdoors.
But experts and economists are aware this is a short term solution.
""We in the north have a problem ahead, and it's called winter,"" Avery Shenfeld, managing director and chief economist of CIBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note last week. 
""Our warmer months will see restaurants more dependent on patio space, but the al fresco dining season lasts a lot longer in Miami than it does in Chicago or Toronto.""
Every year, most restaurants close patios from November to May, when temperatures often average below freezing in much of Canada.
'LOOKING TO SURVIVE'
James Rilett, vice president for central Canada at Restaurants Canada, said the issue of winter in Canada is ""quite a concern"" and ""something that's been on people's minds for a while.""
While he expects to see a run on outdoor heaters, restaurants already had slim profit margins before the pandemic, and the industry has been decimated by lockdown orders. 
That's left businesses with little room for investment in infrastructure to extend the outdoor dining season.
The average pre-pandemic profit margin for a restaurant in Canada was 4.1%, according to Restaurants Canada.
""We haven't seen the magic bullet of how this will come through,"" Rilett said, referring to the problem of continuing outdoor dining when the temperature plummets to -14°Celsius (6.8° Fahrenheit).
Recent coronavirus outbreaks linked to indoor dining - including several from bars in Montreal, and one at a strip club in Vancouver - have underlined the risk of virus spread to government, industry and customers from indoor activities.
Officials in Quebec, Canada's hardest-hit province from the pandemic, are cracking down on crowding at food and drink establishments, closing bars early and mandating masks indoors as of Saturday.
Janet Zuccarini, owner and chief executive of Gusto 54, which owns half a dozen restaurants in Toronto, said her company had bought extra heaters and worked with the city to expand patio space for several of its restaurants.
""You're not looking to make money during the pandemic, you're looking to survive,"" she said. ""The bar is set pretty low right now. ... The pandemic has really exposed the weakness in this industry.""
Restaurants ""know that the window is short,"" Rilett said. ""They know that they're burning daylight, and every day that goes by is one less day that they can make up for the long winter.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - A U.S. business body has asked Japan to eliminate ""double standard"" re-entry rules and treat all residents returning to the country equally during the COVID-19 pandemic regardless of their nationality.
Japan allows its citizens to return to the country on condition they take a polymerase chain reaction test and observe a period of self-quarantine, while foreigners living in Japan face much higher hurdles for re-entry.
""Foreign residents of Japan ... should not be subject to a double standard restricting their travel, economic and familial opportunities based on nationality,"" the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan (ACCJ) said in a statement dated July 13.
Foreigners living in Japan on a long-term basis, such as permanent residents and spouses of Japanese nationals, can re-enter the country if they left Japan before their destination was named as one of the 129 countries from which Japan is banning visits.
But if they left Japan for a country after the ban, the returnees need documentary proof they had exceptional reasons for their trips, such as a funeral or medical treatment, to be considered for re-entry approval.
A spokesman at Japan's Immigration Services Agency said he had no immediate comment on the ACCJ statement.
Catherine Ancelot, a French interpreter who has lived in Japan for 32 years, said she was indignant.
""I cannot see why permanent residents like me and other long-term residents are being discriminated against by nationality,"" Ancelot said.
Shoichi Ibusuki, a Japanese lawyer active on immigration issues, said the measures were damaging Japan's national interest.
""This is being called 'Japan risk' among foreigners living in Japan ... This residence status-related risk has prompted many foreigners to think twice about settling here and to look seriously into moving to other countries,"" he said.

297,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>","Prominent Democrats press Fed, Treasury to aid states, citing racial inequality","(Reuters) - With the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress far from agreement on how or even whether to give more aid to states and cities reeling from revenue losses during the coronavirus crisis, three U.S. Senate Democrats are appealing to the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve to do more to help. 
Citing the particularly sharp impact that cuts to government jobs and services would have on Black Americans, senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen and Catherine Cortez Masto called on Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Fed Chair Jerome Powell to ease the terms of the Fed's lending facility for state and local governments to allow more to tap it. 
So far only one state, Illinois, has borrowed from the facility, launched in May as one of nearly a dozen Fed programs aimed at nursing hard-hit segments of the financial markets and the economy during the crisis. 
Lockdowns, high unemployment, and a drop in consumer confidence has decimated household spending and reduced states' revenue from sales and other taxes, forcing many to lay off staff, trim services, and plan for more cuts in the coming year. 
""Communities of color are already bearing the economic burden of this pandemic,"" the senators wrote in a letter dated July 10, a copy of which was provided to Reuters.
""Failing to provide necessary aid to state and local governments not only threatens the stability of communities across the country, it would also have a disproportionate impact on women, Black, and Hispanic workers, who are overrepresented in public sector jobs.""
Data from many states shows that Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to get COVID-19, and to die from it, than their white counterparts. 
They have also been harder hit economically, with unemployment among African Americans at 15.4% and among Hispanic workers at 14.5% in June, compared with 10.1% among whites. 
Among their demands: to give city and state borrowers more time for repayment and to reduce the interest rate ""to at least match the generosity you have provided through the facilities that lend to businesses that are of even poorer credit quality than the municipal borrowers,"" they wrote.
The facility should also allow smaller cities to tap it if needed, the senators said. 

""To be clear, these solutions are not a substitute for Congress stepping up to provide the needed aid,"" they wrote. Fed policymakers have repeatedly urged Congress to do so.

298,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>","Niche U.S. finance firms grease global trade of masks, gloves","By Anna Irrera and Lawrence Delevingne
NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - From specialty finance firms to boutique investment banks, a disparate mix of small financiers is bankrolling a U.S. gold rush for masks, gloves and other supplies in the wake of the novel coronavirus. 
These financiers stepped in as demand for personal protective equipment - ""PPE"" for short - exploded in recent months, but large banks largely shied away from the trade because many of the deals were too small or the companies involved too risky, according to interviews with financiers, brokers and bank executives.
Technology investor Benjamin Kosinski's VendorTerm, for example, normally offers online invoice financing to technology startups. But the company started financing several PPE deals after some of the companies it normally funds branched out in the market, Kosinski said.
The New York-based startup is offering to finance deals smaller than $5 million in return for 5% to 10% of the total value of the order and a 5% to 25% share of the profits, according to figures confirmed by Kosinski.
Kosinski said the rates reflect the high level of risk involved and that without financing many deals would not happen.
""Banks aren't doing it due to the high risk, and this is where alternative lending and alternative financing can provide value and capital,"" he said. ""Without these deals, there would be less equipment available.""
In another case, Cambridge Wilkinson, a small New York-based investment bank, in early May offered a distributor help securing financing in return for a 5% cut of the total value of the funding, according to a draft contract seen by Reuters. 
A representative of Cambridge Wilkinson did not respond to requests for comment. The investment bank's deal ultimately fell through because the mask broker found another source of capital that was able to provide the funding more quickly.
Some family offices and hedge funds have asked for up to 50% of deal profits, according to Edward King of King Trade Capital. He said his Dallas-based firm has provided ""much less expensive"" alternatives using purchase order finance, especially for businesses new to the PPE market.
Much has been written about fly-by-night, distributor middle men arranging deals and driving up prices of essential supplies during the pandemic, but little is known about the financiers who fund various distributors.
While they serve an essential purpose by greasing a complicated trade that meets an urgent demand, some market participants said their presence can drive up costs of these essential supplies. 
""It adds to the cost of the product and makes it more expensive,"" said Murlikrishna Kannan, an anesthesiologist and the founder of Anesthesia Hygiene, a medical equipment company that has been distributing coronavirus-related supplies since the pandemic began. Kannan said he looked into a financing offer over the past few months and opted not to go ahead with it in part because of the cost, but may have to consider these options in the future.
In many cases, however, the fees these financiers are charging are in line with what banks typically charge, according to trade finance experts. Banks can charge 3% to 8% of transaction costs, depending on creditworthiness of the borrowers, they said. 
Several investors said their fees were justified because these transactions were especially risky. Most involve multiple parties across the world, many new to the market, they said. Things often go wrong, from shipments being delayed or stuck at customs, to the price of transport rising unexpectedly. Fraud is also common, they said. 
Moreover, some manufacturers ask for payment upfront, making the role of financiers crucial to keep trade flowing.
Revenue for the U.S. personal protective equipment sector is expected to surge 15.2% to $5.7 billion this year, as the industry responds to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a May report by research firm IBISWorld.
Distributors and financiers said demand is expected to continue into the winter as the economy reopens and masks, gloves and sanitizers remain essential accessories for the foreseeable future. 
""We are the key that's unlocking the solution,"" said Mead Welles, head of Octagon Asset Management LLC, a trade and commodity finance firm.

He said his fees are usually ""well below"" 2% of the total transaction cost.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy could shrink by more than 14% this year if there is lasting damage from the coronavirus, a scenario that would push government borrowing to nearly half a trillion dollars, budget forecasters said on Tuesday.
The Office for Budget Responsibility, whose projections are used by the government, said tax hikes or spending cuts would probably be needed to fix the huge hole in the public finances.
""The UK is on track to record the largest decline in annual GDP for 300 years, with output falling by more than 10% in 2020 in all three scenarios,"" the OBR said in a report.
""This delivers an unprecedented peacetime rise in borrowing this year to between 13% and 21% of GDP, lifting debt above 100% of GDP in all but the upside scenario.""
The central scenario, with only moderate long-term damage, showed a 12.4% fall in output, with a 14.3% decline if the scarring is deeper.
In the downside scenario borrowing in the current financial year could hit 391 billion pounds ($490 billion), and in the upside one 263 billion pounds, with output falling 10.6%.
Last month, the International Monetary Fund said Britain's economy looks set to shrink by more than 10% this year.
The OBR scenarios do not incorporate gross national product data published on Tuesday, which showed a only a modest return to growth in May following the lockdown.
Nor do they include measures announced by finance minister Rishi Sunak last week that could cost up to 30 billion pounds, which the OBR said would have had a material effect on the borrowing outlook.
An increase in Britain's historically low borrowing costs could leave government finances vulnerable, given the sharp rise in debt, the OBR said.
Even under the most optimistic scenario, the unemployment rate looks likely to peak at almost 10% in the third quarter of 2020, it added, with its downside scenario showing the peak at 13.2% in early 2021.

Investing.com -- Earnings season kicks into gear with reports from three of the U.S.'s biggest banks. Stocks are set for a modest bounce after falling sharply in reaction to news on Monday that California is rolling back its economic reopening and delaying the resumption of in-person schooling. Chinese trade data return to year-on-year growth for the first time since the pandemic erupted, but European data are less convincing. And OPEC presents its monthly report on the oil market while technical staff work out whether the current deal on output restraint is being properly observed. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, July 14th.
1. Reopening rollback
California Governor Gavin Newsom ordered the closure of all indoor businesses. The state’s two largest school districts, in Los Angeles and San Diego, will also conduct classes remotely after the summer break, defying pressure from the federal government to reopen.
The measures, which apply to bars, indoor restaurants, movie theaters and nail salons among other things, are the most dramatic reversal yet of the economic reopening across the U.S. They come after a 20% increase in cases and a 10% rise in deaths across the state over the last week.
The national seven-day rolling average for new cases, which evens out some short-term volatility in the reporting, has risen from less than 20,000 in mid-June to a new record of over 59,000 as of Monday.
Reopening has brought similar concerns across the world, with both Japan and Germany warning on Monday that nightclubbing in particular could prompt renewed surges in infections.
 2. Bank reports to set the tone for Q2 earnings season
Earnings season kicks into gear, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) all due to report on what is set to be a dismal quarter.  
Of most interest will be the rate at which banks are building provisions against corporate and personal loans turning bad as they are struck by a wave of bankruptcies and job losses. The provisions number will, indirectly, be a comment on the effectiveness of government policy in preserving jobs.
FactSet estimates that S&P 500 companies overall will post a 10% decline in revenue and a 45% drop in earnings in the quarter. The banks look likely to fare even worse:  JPMorgan’s earnings per share expected to have fallen by more than half to $1.19, while Citigroup’s are expected to fall 84% to 36c.
3. U.S. Stocks set to bounce a little; Delta, Softbank in spotlight
U.S. stocks are set for a modest bounce at opening after sharp losses on Monday in response to the Californian news, although the quarterly reports from the banks may change all that.
By 5:55 AM ET (9:55 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 96 points or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract were both up 0.3%. Overnight, UBS struck a note of caution regarding tech stock valuations, cutting its recommendation on both Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).
In addition to the three big banks, there’ll also be earnings from Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). Also in the spotlight may be SoftBank ADRs (OTC:SFTBY), which hit a one-year high on Monday on reports that it is lining up a possible sale of a stake in chipmaker ARM.
4 Chinese exports, imports return to growth; German, U.K. data underwhelm
China’s external trade data showed positive numbers in year-on-year terms for the first time since the pandemic erupted at the start of the year.  Chinese exports rose 0.5% on the year in June, while imports rose 2.7%, due largely to the country’s taking advantage of low prices to restock their crude oil reserves.
China has emerged furthest from the pandemic-induced collapse partly because it was the first country to be hit by it. In Europe, which only started to suffer two months after China, the recovery is still looking fragile: U.K. May GDP data rebounded by only 1.8% rather than the 5.5% expected, although industrial output and manufacturing were down by slightly less than feared.
In Germany, meanwhile, the ZEW index of economic sentiment fell from June due to a much sharper-than-expected worsening in the assessment of current conditions.
5. Oil steadies on evidence of Chinese buying; OPEC report due
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will release its monthly assessment of the global oil market, on the same day that a two-day technical meeting to assess compliance with the so-called OPEC+ deal on output restraint starts.
Oil prices steadied overnight having weakened on Monday in response to the Californian news, which casts fresh doubt over the trajectory for fuel demand.
Signs of record buying by Chinese importers in June then acted as a counter-weight. Crude imports to China soared to a record 12.99 million barrels a day in June, up over 3.3 million b/d from May.  
U.S. crude futures were down 0.8% at $39.77 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent was down 0.6% at $42.47 a barrel"

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's capital on Tuesday prepared to host its twice-postponed annual auto show, with organizers saying it would showcase the country's success in containing the coronavirus. 
From Detroit to Geneva, motor shows have been forced to cancel due to the COVID-19 pandemic, throwing the future of the industry's traditional way of marketing new models into doubt. 
The 41st Bangkok International Motor Show opens to the public on Wednesday after being pushed back twice since March. 
""This is more than the motor show, but also Thailand's reputation because the other event organizers will be watching,"" said Prachin Eamlumnow, chief executive of head organizer of the event,  Grand Prix  International (BK:GPI). 
Thailand will be the first to host a motor show on this scale since the pandemic, he told reporters. 
Thailand has had no locally transmitted cases of COVID-19 for about seven weeks and has been easing restrictions imposed to tackle the outbreak, seeking to get its economy moving again. 
The Southeast Asian country is a major regional car production hub, with its previous motor shows registering more than a million visitors. 
Organisers have pledged to limit crowds this year and control entry at the show, where 25 car brands - including Ford and Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) - and 22 motorcycle manufacturers will display their products. 
Each brand's booth has entry and exit points and guests are required to scan a QR code, a type of barcode, with their mobile phones when entering and leaving, unlike at previous shows when people could roam freely. 
Staff at the booths will also be wearing masks or face shields during the show, which runs from July 15 to July 26.

""The government allowed us to hold it, but we still must be very careful,"" said Prachin.

302,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>","Faced with COVID-19, highest number of Australians tap retirement funds since April","By Scott Murdoch and Byron Kaye
HONG KONG/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australians asked to pull out more than A$5 billion ($3.5 billion) from their pension funds in the first week of July, the highest since the government granted early access to retirement savings to support a coronavirus-hit economy.
Some 511,000 Australians applied to pull up to A$10,000 each from their retirement savings in the first week of the new financial year, government data showed, the highest number of people to do so since the first week the scheme was in operation in April.
Australia announced the six-month emergency scheme, which allows workers to take up to A$20,000 of their superannuation savings over two financial years, in March as part of a broader stimulus package.
The figures take the total amount Australians have applied to withdraw to A$23.3 billion. The government forecast a total of A$27 billion would be pulled from the world's third-largest pension pool when it first unveiled the scheme.
""The long-term impact of this scheme will be felt for years to come,"" said Kirstin Hunter, co-founder at Future Super, which manages A$750 million in retirement savings.
""Superannuation was never intended to be a national relief fund. Australians should not have to dip into their life savings to get through a public health crisis,"" she added.
The figures showed nearly a quarter of the country's 12 million workforce have drawn down their pension savings as Australia's economy faces its first recession in three decades.
Jane Hume, assistant minister for superannuation, said that tapping retirement early ""comes at a cost"" but that, for some, ""clearly the benefits of having their own money back in their pocket today may outweigh locking it up.""
Fund managers said the cash withdrawal amounted to a small percentage of the country's A$3 trillion pension pool, but that it was weighing on Australia's stock market (AXJO), down one-sixth since February.
""We think it is likely a factor in why the Australian market has underperformed globally during this period,"" said Matthew Ross, managing director of portfolio strategy and quantitative research at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Australia.

303,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 04:27AM ET</span>",America’s Jobless Are About to Lose Their $600-a-Week Lifeline,"(Bloomberg) -- In about two weeks millions of Americans could lose a crucial economic lifeline of this pandemic: $600 a week in extra federal unemployment benefits.
The scheduled end will ripple through households and the entire economy. The program accounts for a big chunk of the Treasury Department’s record jobless payments last month, which exceeded $100 billion. Without the additional cash, some of the hardest-hit households may be forced to choose which bills to pay and which to let slide.
For Amanda Steinhauser in New Jersey, it will mean burning through meager savings even faster. For Chris Bolei in California, it means not knowing how he’ll make rent. For Raven Gilbert in North Carolina, it could mean struggling to buy food.
The deadline comes as the economic recovery shows signs of losing steam with renewed outbreaks causing states to reverse or stall reopenings. These extra benefits have in some cases prevented working-class people -- and the women and minorities who disproportionately rely on jobless benefits -- from sliding farther down the ladder of prosperity.
Meanwhile, policy makers in Washington are at a standstill in their talks for more stimulus, and in particular whether to include an extension of the extra unemployment benefits. The weekly supplemental federal assistance was added to traditional unemployment benefits, which are administered by states and can vary widely in size.
Democrats want to extend the program, called Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation. Republicans and the Trump administration have called for capping the amount of money jobless Americans can receive, seeing it as a disincentive to return to work.
Interviews with those who have relied on the extra benefits offer a glimpse into a wide-reaching program that may yet prove crucial to the economy’s recovery.
A $600 ‘Lifeline’
For Chris Bolei, 63, the extra $600 a week is “a lifeline to our pre-pandemic existence.” Before the pandemic, Bolei, from San Rafael, California, was making about $75,000 a year as a maintenance supervisor. Even with the government aid he and his wife, who is high-risk for severe complications from Covid-19, struggle to pay their bills. Without the weekly bonus, he said his rent payments and wife’s medical bills will become impossible.
“It’s going to put me in an extremely uncomfortable and possibly threatening situation with my housing,” he said.
Earning More
Some Americans are making more money from jobless benefits than they did when they were employed. Two-thirds of workers who are eligible for unemployment insurance can receive more than what they lost in earnings, according to a paper by researchers at the University of Chicago.
Amanda Steinhauser, 33, is one of them. Before the pandemic began, she earned $14.75 an hour at a small party supply company in Blackwood, New Jersey. Now, she’s earning nearly twice as much with unemployment assistance. As a result, she has paid off some credit card debt and is saving hundreds of dollars each week.
But she says her savings will run out in a matter of months, before the U.S. jobs market is expected to return to normal. Without the additional federal top-up, Steinhauser’s unemployment benefits will fall to $280 a week, about half of what she made before the pandemic.
“I have been looking for a job ever since I was laid off back in March, and I haven’t been able to find anything,” Steinhauser said. “If I don’t have that $600, I know I’m going to be screwed.”
Employers argue that the $600 boost has created a disincentive for employees to return to work. For example, at the diner chain Waffle House Inc., based in Norcross, Georgia, some employees aren’t coming back to work because they make more money from unemployment, creating a shortage during some shifts, according to spokeswoman Njeri Boss.
Earning Less and Jobs Are Scarce
Those searching for jobs have faced an extremely challenging -- and competitive -- market. Job postings as of July 10 were about 23% lower than they were in 2019, according to data from hiring site Indeed.
Jill Haber, 42, has been looking for a job since April when she was laid off from a senior position at a marketing agency in Los Angeles. The extra weekly benefits have helped her pay monthly bills but doesn’t make up for her salary. Adding to her expenses, Haber now has to pay for her own healthcare.
Without the extra $600, she said she’ll be getting roughly a fifth of what she made at her job. She will have to dip into her savings, which she had intended to use in the future to buy a home or retire. Making matters worse, her car lease will soon expire and she needed to buy a car. Without income, Haber’s 78-year-old mother had to co-sign her loan. She said she’s lucky she has savings.
“I’m lucky in that I have that to dip into,” Haber said. “A lot of people don’t.”
Getting By While Earning Less
For those receiving Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, or the program that extends jobless benefits to those not typically covered like the self-employed and gig workers, the extra $600 often takes on even greater importance.
Raven (NASDAQ:RAVN) Gilbert used to manage the bar at Hunter House & Gardens, a wedding and event venue in Huntersville, North Carolina, before she was laid off in March. She said she didn’t qualify for regular state jobless benefits but was able to get PUA.
Even with the $600 weekly bonus, the sum falls short of what she was making earlier this year. Though she hopes her job will become available again, she’s been looking for a new job but bars are still closed and restaurants are operating at reduced capacity. Without the extra unemployment benefit, she qualifies for just $134 a week in government aid.
“I don’t know what will happen,” Gilbert said. “I don’t know that I’ll be able to make my bills or buy enough food.”

With a pandemic-induced crisis shutting much of the euro zone economy, firms rushed to tap bank credit to stay liquid and government guarantee schemes provided vital support for banks to keep cash flowing.
""In the third quarter of 2020, banks expect a considerable net tightening of credit standards on loans to enterprises, which is reported to be related to the expected end of state guarantee schemes in some large euro area countries,"" the ECB said in a lending survey. 
Credit standards on housing loans tightened in the second quarter and this trend is likely to continue in the third quarter, the ECB added based on a survey of 144 banks done between June 5 and 23, just as restrictive measures were being slowly lifted.
Corporate credit demand also surged in the second quarter as firms drew on their credit lines for emergency liquidity but banks expect a more moderate increase in demand during the current quarter.
Household loan demand fell sharply in the second quarter but banks see a rebound in the third quarter. 

A key input in the ECB's deliberations, the quarterly lending survey comes just two days before the ECB's July policy meeting that will likely review the bank's ultra easy policy stance but not approve any further stimulus measures.

LONDON (Reuters) - A third of company audits by Britain's leading accounting firms failed a quality test, the country's accounting watchdog said on Tuesday, piling further pressure on a sector already being questioned over its competence.
The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said 29 of 88 audits inspected needed improvements, with 7 of these requiring significant improvements.
The review covered the ""Big Four"" auditors - Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC - as well as smaller firms Grant Thornton, Mazars and BDO.
The FRC had set the firms a raised target of 100% of the audits inspected requiring no more than limited improvements, up from 90% previously, and none passed.
Of the Big Four, KPMG chalked up the most audit quality failures with 7 out of 18. Nearly half of Grant Thornton's audits fell short of the required standard, at 4 out of 9 inspected, the watchdog found.
In their responses to the FRC, both KPMG and Grant Thornton said they were disappointed with the results and were taking action to improve their standards.
Auditors in Britain have come under increased scrutiny in recent years after high-profile corporate failures at builder Carillion, retailer BHS and an accounting scandal at cafe chain Patisserie Valerie.
The FRC fined Grant Thornton 3 million pounds ($3.8 million) this month for ethics failures on its audit of drinks retailer Conviviality.
It also recommended a record fine of 15 million pounds for Deloitte for ""serious and serial failings"" in its audit of technology company Autonomy.
""We are concerned that firms are still not consistently achieving the necessary level of audit quality. While firms have made some improvements, and we have observed instances of good practice, it is clear that further progress is required,"" said David Rule, the FRC's executive director of supervision. 
""The tone from the top at the firms needs to support a culture of challenge and to back auditors making tough decisions.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy likely returned to modest growth in the second quarter after a record contraction, as lockdown measures ended and policymakers announced more stimulus to combat the shock from the coronavirus crisis, according to a Reuters poll.
The world's second-largest economy likely grew 2.5% in April-June from a year earlier, reversing a 6.8% decline in the first quarter - the first contraction since at least 1992 when official quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) records started, the poll showed.
But the expected growth rate would still be the weakest expansion on record.
Forecasts by 55 analysts polled by Reuters ranged from a 
3.1% contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) to a 4.0% expansion in the second quarter, reflecting uncertainty over the pace of recovery. 
China's services sector, which is dominated by smaller companies, has not rebounded as quickly as industrial production, though there are some signs that consumer confidence is gradually improving.
On a quarterly basis, GDP is expected to have grown 9.6% in April-June, compared with a decline of 9.8% in the previous
quarter. 
The government has rolled out a raft of measures, including more fiscal spending, tax relief and cuts in lending rates and banks' reserve requirements to revive the virus-hit economy and support employment.
Still, analysts say the recovery remains fragile, as rising coronavirus inflections in some countries overshadow improved demand for Chinese exports while heavy domestic job losses and lingering health concerns have kept consumers cautious.
Data on Tuesday showed the country's imports in June rose for the first time this year as stimulus boosted demand for building materials, while exports also edged up as overseas economies reopened after lockdowns.
While China's economy is showing a steady recovery, a hard battle still lies ahead as the situation remains severe both at home and abroad, state radio quoted Premier Li Keqiang as saying on Monday.
China releases second-quarter GDP data on Thursday (0200 GMT), along with June factory output, retail sales and fixed-asset investment.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect industrial output to grow 4.7% in June from a year earlier, quickening from a 4.4% rise in May, while retail sales were seen rising 0.3%, versus a 2.8% fall in May. Retail sales have slumped for five months in a row.
Fixed-asset investment is forecast to fall 3.3% in the
first six months from a year earlier, easing from a 6.3%
slide in the first five months, according to the poll.
POLICY SUPPORT STILL NEEDED
Central bank governor Yi Gang has said China would keep financial system liquidity ample in the second half but would need to consider withdrawing support at some point, raising questions among investors over when it may start dialing down stimulus.
Still, analysts expect policymakers to maintain support for the economy for a while longer to ensure the recovery remains on track, despite a rise in overall debt levels.
Tang Jianwei, senior economist at Bank of Communications, expected the central bank to dole out 1-2 more targeted reserve requirement cuts and another 20 basis points of cuts in the interest rate on the medium-term lending facility in the second half.
Credit growth is also expected to remain strong. New bank lending hit a record 12.09 trillion yuan ($1.72 trillion) in the first half of the year.
Moreover, China has allowed local governments to issue 3.75 trillion yuan in special bonds to fund infrastructure projects, up from 2.15 trillion yuan last year, and issue 1 trillion yuan in special treasury bonds to spur activity.
Tang expected the economy to grow around 2.5% this year.
The International Monetary Fund has forecast an expansion of 1.0% for China for the full year, the only major economy expected to report growth in 2020.

The plan would move Asia's fourth-largest economy away from its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and promote environmentally friendly industries powered by digital technologies, including electric and hydrogen cars, smart grids and telemedicine.
The new projects are expected to create some 1.9 million jobs through 2025, Moon said in a speech.
South Korea aimed to have 1.13 million electric vehicles and 200,000 hydrogen cars on the roads by 2025, up from 91,000 and 5,000 respectively at the end of 2019, he said, while the government would expand charging stations for the vehicles.
The plan would promote remote medical services, a work-from-home policy for businesses and online schools based on fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks, and would include tax breaks for telecom providers installing the systems.
The government would also invest 24.3 trillion won to set up smart grids across the country to manage electricity use more efficiently, Moon said.

Fourteen of 26 economists polled expect the central bank will trim the 7-day reverse repurchase rate  by 25 basis points to 4.00%, the lowest since at least 2016, when it adopted the rate as its benchmark.
The other 12 see the central bank standing pat on rates due to the recent depreciation of the rupiah currency .
BI and the government last week unveiled a $40 billion fiscal deficit financing scheme to fund the fight against the coronavirus pandemic in Southeast Asia's largest economy. 
The ""burden-sharing"" scheme involves the central bank promising to purchase 397.6 trillion rupiah ($27.71 billion) worth of government bonds while relinquishing interest payments.
Governor Perry Warjiyo has reiterated several times that BI has scope for more rate cuts even after the bond-buying scheme.
""It will be a close call but we think Bank Indonesia will cut interest rates,"" Alex Holmes of consultancy Capital Economics wrote in a note. ""The economy is certainly in need of further support.""
A rate cut on Thursday will be on top of the three reductions of 75 bps so far this year, as inflation remains low
BI last month trimmed its 2020 gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast to 0.9%-1.9%, with 2021 growth seen at 5%-6%. 
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said last week GDP may have shrunk by as much as 5.1% annually in the second quarter.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts, however, say a pause in the easing cycle is slightly more likely given the rupiah's 3% decline since the June central bank meeting, although they continue to expect further cuts of 50 bps this quarter.
President Joko Widodo said on Monday Indonesia's coronavirus outbreak is expected to peak in August or September, state news agency Antara reported, after the country saw 76,981 infections, and 3,656 fatalities.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank is expected to keep its policy rate steady on Thursday and for the rest of 2020, a Reuters poll showed, as red-hot property prices forced policymakers into a tight corner as they look to support the coronavirus-ravaged economy.
All 30 analysts surveyed by Reuters expect the Bank of Korea (BOK) to keep its base rate  unchanged at the current record-low of 0.50% after a 25-basis-point cut in May.
The BOK in May trimmed its 2020 economic projections for Asia's fourth-largest economy to a 0.2% decline, the worst since 1998 during the Asian financial crisis, but the International Monetary Fund sees an even bigger 2.1% contraction.
The country has so far reported a total 13,512 coronavirus infections and 289 deaths since the outbreak earlier this year.
DBS Economist Ma Tieying said a pick-up in domestic demand and the easing in the pace of declines in exports have reduced the urgency for further rate cuts.
""The expansion in money supply and the rebound in property prices should also reduce the need or constrain the room for the BOK to further ease monetary policy,"" she added.
The record low policy rate has been blamed by industry analysts and first home buyers for fuelling a rampant property boom in key areas.
On Friday, the government announced that it will further tighten property rules and impose heavier taxes on multiple homeowners to curb runaway home prices.
All 24 analysts who provided forecasts for end-2020 saw the BOK standing pat through the rest of the year.
""Further easing is unlikely as May meeting minutes showed the bank has only limited policy room left, while major economies have stopped cutting rates further,"" said Kim Jina, an analyst at IBK Securities & Investment.
The May 28 BOK meeting minutes also showed two board member expressing concerns that lower rates could funnel even more cash into the volatile property market.

The central bank announces its rate decision around 0100 GMT on Thursday and will broadcast the governor's press conference live on YouTube from 0220 GMT.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will begin debate next week on a fifth coronavirus-response bill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday, as he forecast tough negotiations with Democrats who are seeking broader aid than Republicans.
""Next week, we'll be beginning a new bill,"" McConnell said during an interview with WRVK radio in his home state of Kentucky.
McConnell added the legislation, which has not yet been unveiled, will likely be more contentious than the previous four coronavirus aid bills. Those pumped more than $3 trillion into the hobbled economy with a combination of business loans, expanded unemployment benefits for workers and direct payments to families.
""I do think we'll get there and do something that needs to be done"" before Congress begins an August recess, the Republican senator predicted.
But there are also divisions among Republicans - in the White House and in Congress - over the precise direction of the upcoming bill, including whether there should be another round of direct payments to individuals and families.
McConnell has talked about a bill costing no more than $1 trillion, while Democrats in the House of Representatives passed a $3 trillion measure in mid-May that McConnell has so far ignored.
McConnell wants to focus on liability protections for business, schools and other entities as they reopen their operations even as coronavirus cases surge in many parts of the United States, including Kentucky.
California on Monday imposed new restrictions on businesses as coronavirus hospitalizations soared in the country's most-populous state. Coronavirus infections have risen rapidly in about 40 of the 50 states over the past two weeks, according to a Reuters analysis.
Democrats are pushing for new federal aid to state and local governments affected by the coronavirus, which Republicans have resisted.
Lawmakers also have been arguing over extending special unemployment benefits that are due to expire at the end of July, as well as a massive small business-loan program that runs through early August.

312,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 07:20PM ET</span>",California's new lockdown dims outlook for U.S. growth in pandemic,"(Reuters) - California Governor Gavin Newsom's decision Monday to reimpose restrictions on bars, restaurants, gyms and even ordinary office work to tamp down a surge of coronavirus infections is dimming economic growth prospects for the nation as a whole.
Darkening the outlook further was the decision by California's two largest school districts - Los Angeles and San Diego - to conduct only online instruction when classes resume next month, a move that will make it challenging for parents of more than 825,000 students to return to work.
The Golden State, with 40 million people, employs more workers than any other state in the nation, and its production of goods and services is about equal to the combined output of Florida and Texas, two others states that have also seen resurgences of the virus.
After the Great Recession, California was the nation's inarguable job growth engine, creating about one in every seven jobs, more than any other state. 
By comparison, over the course of the 12-year post-financial crisis expansion Texas created one of every eight U.S. jobs, and Florida, about one of every 11.
In March, after becoming the first U.S. state to impose a stay-at-home order in response to the coronavirus pandemic, California also became the nation's job-loss leader. Some 2.6 million jobs disappeared in March and April, about equal to the combined job losses in Texas and Florida. 
The idea, of course, was to stop infections from getting out of control, trading a steep economic decline to create the conditions both for better public health and for a faster economic recovery. 
So far, it hasn't worked out that way.
Many states began to reopen in May. California allowed businesses to resume activity at a slower pace than many states did. That shows in the most recent state-by-state jobs data: during the course May, California added just 141,600 jobs, versus 182,000 in Florida and 237,000 in Texas. 
Since then, the virus has resurged in much of the country, with the biggest increases in Florida, Texas, Arizona and California, forcing governors in all of those states to reimpose some restrictions. 
But none has gone as far as Newsom did on Monday; and none of those states has near the footprint of California when it comes to economic heft on a national scale. Before the coronavirus crisis, the state accounted for about 14% of the whole U.S. economy. 
With about 8,200 new infections daily and rising hospitalizations in California, Newsom is shutting bars and banning indoor restaurant dining statewide, and closing gyms, hair salons and non-essential workplaces in counties where the vast majority of its population lives. 
And with those new restrictions, the state's relatively meager job gains so far could stall or even reverse. 
Moreover on Monday, Los Angeles, the state's largest school district, and San Diego both announced they would not hold classes in-person come fall.

313,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 07:18PM ET</span>",The Virus Is Still Sapping China’s $6 Trillion Power to Consume,"(Bloomberg) -- Three months after China started to emerge from its coronavirus restrictions, its army of shoppers that help power the global economy are still nervous of travel, reticent to spend and forming habits that may change the face of consumption permanently.
In this first edition of a regular fixture, Bloomberg News has brought together a range of data from property spending to dining out, gambling to air travel, for a comprehensive look at the health of the Chinese consumer.
The verdict for now: a recovery is indeed underway -- but it’s slow and vulnerable to setbacks like the latest virus flareup in Beijing.
With global demand for China’s manufacturing goods most likely depressed this year due to the accelerating pandemic, domestic consumer behavior matters even more for the country, as well as the wider global economy.
China powered one-third of global consumption growth from 2010 to 2017, according to a report from McKinsey Global Institute. Over the next 10 years, the growth in Chinese consumption is expected to equal that of the U.S. and Western Europe combined.
Retail sales data due this week is forecast to show a return to growth in June, but the value of sales so far this year will still be well down on the first half of last year.
“Leading indicators suggest retail sales should have continued to recover in June,” according to a report from Bloomberg Economists Chang Shu and David Qu. “Even so, the revival in consumption probably remains a long way off, given changes in behavior to the detriment of contact-intensive services, as well as stress in the labor market and dented incomes.”
CHINA INSIGHT: Recovery Slows, Virus Flares Up -- Dashboard
High-frequency data for June and the early days of July paint a similarly mixed picture. While housing sales rose in early June from last year, car sales were down.
When all is well, data on gambling receipts in Macau -- China’s Las Vegas -- can illustrate the confidence of a rapidly growing economy. This year’s data are a stark reminder that the pandemic is far from over: with borders largely closed to Chinese punters, revenue has plunged by more than 90% for three consecutive months, while casinos are losing $15 million daily in expenses, estimated  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Less Travel
As an indicator of economic activity, travel data show a picture of incomplete recovery. Highways and rail passenger traffic still shows fewer people traveling than the same period last year, indicating that many aren’t traversing long distances, whether for work or tourism.
Tourism during June’s national holidays was down about half compared to 2019 and the stay-at-home impulse is still strong in the biggest cities, with subway ridership in Beijing and Shanghai remaining below normal levels.
One silver lining for retail has been the almost complete halt of global travel and disrupted networks of parallel importers, which have trapped high-end shoppers at home.
Chinese buyers power over a third of the global industry, and their inability to travel is set to boost the luxury market on the mainland by as much as 10% this year, compared to a 45% plunge in the global industry, according to estimates by Boston Consulting Group.
Physical economic activity is moving online at a rapid pace, judging by the speed at which the delivery of parcels and mail is growing, a bright spot amid a sea of slowing indicators.
The recovery in China provides an example for other nations about how quickly economic demand can rebound once the viral outbreak is contained and people are more confident that just going out and shopping won’t make them ill. But it also shows that any revival will be limited.
“China’s recovery path supports our current baseline forecasts for private consumption in other major economies, which are lagging by 1-2 quarters,” according to Wang Tao, chief China economist at UBS AG. “Robust sequential rebound in retail sales and consumer services, but a soft overall recovery due to weak labor markets and income growth, and persistent concerns about safety and future outlook.”

314,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 06:50PM ET</span>","Amid pandemic, wealthy U.S. families approved for government loans","By Lawrence Delevingne
BOSTON (Reuters) - Private investment firms that manage the fortunes of wealthy individuals and their kin were approved for millions of dollars in taxpayer-funded relief loans designed to help small businesses weather the coronavirus lockdown, according to a review of recently released government data.
The companies - often referred to as ""family offices"" - approved for the forgivable loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA) included those that oversee money for the family that co-owns the National Basketball Association’s Sacramento Kings; the former manager of a multi-billion dollar hedge fund firm; and a serial Las Vegas entrepreneur. 
The data from the U.S. Treasury Department and SBA shows only that the loans were approved from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) but does not say how much was disbursed or if they had been returned or forgiven. Still, it was not always clear why the families found it necessary to apply for emergency cash, usually for less than $1 million, given the substantial funds available implied by their having private investing vehicles. 
""The PPP was meant for struggling small businesses who aren’t able to operate at normal capacity,"" said Andrew Park, senior policy analyst at Americans for Financial Reform. ""This is akin to dipping their hands into a charity jar.""
Among those approved, Rothschild Capital Partners LLC, a New York-based firm that manages money for its chief executive, David D. Rothschild and others, got the go-ahead for a loan of up to $350,000 to retain eight jobs. The firm managed approximately $330 million at the end of 2019 on behalf of the Rothschild family and a group of wealthy investors, according to public filings.
Representatives for Rothschild did not respond to requests for comment. 
The family offices identified by Reuters usually applied for the SBA loans in March or April, when financial markets were substantially lower or some of their portfolio companies were struggling. 
The Zarrow Family Office LLC in Tulsa, Oklahoma, confirmed to Reuters that it received a PPP loan and said it used the money to support shared staff with its family foundations at a time when its investments had declined, allowing for continued assistance to local non-profits. The public data shows a loan to Zarrow of between $150,000 and $350,000 and 14 jobs retained. The Anne and Henry Zarrow Foundation had assets of $473 million at the end of 2018, according to a public filing.
""When this national program became available, the stock market had just experienced a significant loss with projections of more to come,"" Bill Major, the executive director of Zarrow's foundations, wrote in an email. ""The funds were procured to maintain the staff and to maximize the funds available to support non-profits who were in crisis.""
About 2,000 firms that manage money or advise on investments, such as hedge funds or wealth advisers https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-ppp-funds/wall-street-investors-scored-emergency-government-loans-amid-pandemic-idUSKBN2472V7, were approved for loans meant to shore up payroll and rent costs for small companies, according to the data released last week. 
Reuters findings prompted criticism of the Trump Administration from the campaign staff of U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden.
""The news that some of America’s wealthiest families were benefiting from federal aid intended for small businesses even in the middle of an avoidable economic collapse is despicable — but not surprising,"" Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager and communications director, said in a statement.
Ken Farnaso, deputy national press secretary for the Trump campaign, said that view from Biden's camp was intentionally misleading and the program was a job-saving success.
""It’s sad that the former vice president and Democrats across the country have politicized a lifesaving program that even some of them were blessed to have benefitted from,” Farnaso told Reuters by email. 
All told, the SBA said in a report, finance and insurance firms represented $12.2 billion across 168,462 loans, about 2.3% of the program’s total lending as of June 30.
Others that were approved for PPP loans include RAJ Capital Management LLC in Newport Beach, California. RAJ is a family office for the Bhathal family, which made its fortune in swimwear and now co-owns the Sacramento Kings, among other investments. The public data shows a loan to RAJ of between $150,000 and $350,000 and 11 jobs retained. 
Lisa Bhathal Merage, managing partner of RAJ, said in an email that the PPP funds the company accessed were on the ""lower side"" of the reported range. 
""Our family is not taking PPP. The use of funds is used to support the staffing of a new business venture that experienced disruption,"" she said. ""This business' payroll flows through the umbrella of RAJ Capital Management, that is why the PPP was applied for and granted under this name."" 
Yamagata Enterprises Family Office LLC, tied to serial Las Vegas entrepreneur Gene Yamagata, was approved for two PPP loans of as much as $350,000 from separate banks, according to the data. A 2019 real estate credit report from rating agency DBRS said Yamagata’s reported net worth was approximately $93 million as of November 2018. 
The family office of former high-profile hedge fund manager Jacob Gottlieb, New York-based Altium Capital Management LP, was also approved for up to $350,000 to retain eight jobs, according to the disclosure. Gottlieb until recently ran the approximately $8 billion Visium Asset Management before it shut down amid a financial fraud scandal https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fraud/ex-visium-fund-manager-sentenced-to-18-months-after-fraud-conviction-idUSKBN19530H.
Representatives for Yamagata and Gottlieb did not respond to requests for comment.
Overall, the government loan program protected about 51.1 million American jobs https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-ppp/u-s-pandemic-aid-program-saved-51-1-million-jobs-but-wealthy-and-connected-also-benefited-idUSKBN2471ZD, the Trump administration said last Monday, as it revealed how $521.4 billion in taxpayer cash was injected into small businesses.
But problems in the data have cast doubt on the projection of how many jobs were saved, Reuters has reported https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-ppp-jobs/trump-administration-says-pandemic-aid-saved-51-million-jobs-did-it-idUSKBN24901U.
The loans were largely approved on a good-faith basis, with borrowers certifying to their eligibility and the accuracy of the data they provided, meaning the figures on how many jobs were retained have not been thoroughly vetted. Loans that appear to breach the letter or spirit of the rules may not be forgiven.

The Treasury plans to conduct a full review of loans of more than $2 million, meaning for now, at least many of the loans to family firms may fall under the radar.

U.S. Cases Rise 2% (3:59 p.m. NY)
Coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 2% as compared to the same time yesterday to 3.34 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. That was in line with the 1.9% average increase over the past week.
California Shuts Indoor Dining, Bars (3:48 p.m. NY)
California Governor Gavin Newsom ordered all inside dining, wineries, movie theaters and other indoor entertainment closed to control the spread of Covid-19.
Bars and breweries statewide must close all indoor and outdoor operations, while fitness centers, worship services, protests and salons must shut in counties that have been on a monitoring list for three straight days. Those counties include Sacramento, Santa Barbara, San Benito and San Diego.
California reported 109,910 new cases in the last 14 days, and 1,104 new deaths, out of a total of 329,162 cases and 7,040 deaths. The state has 1,716 new patients in hospitals for Covid-19 in the past two weeks, an increase of 28% from the previous two weeks.
California Sees Record Hospitalizations (2:25 p.m. NY)
California reported a record number of people hospitalized with coronavirus: 6,485 on Sunday, up 2.6% from the previous day. The state also reported 8,358 new cases -- above the 14-day average of 7,800 -- as well as 23 new deaths, well below the 14-day average of 76.
L.A., San Diego Schools Go Remote in Fall: NYT (2:05 p.m. NY)
California’s largest school districts, Los Angeles and San Diego, said instruction will be remote only in the fall due to concerns over the coronavirus, according to the New York Times.
The school districts, which together enroll 825,000 students, are the largest in the U.S. to abandon plans for a physical return to classrooms when they reopen, the Times reported.
The joint announcement came as U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos continued to press the Trump administration’s case to quickly reopen public schools, not only for students’ social and emotional development but also to allow parents to return to work fully, the newspaper said.
Atlanta Mayor Asks N.Y. for Help (1:05 p.m. NY)
New York state will send Atlanta resources to help increase testing and tracing efforts as the number of new coronavirus cases in Georgia continue to climb.
Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, on Monday via video link, asked Governor Andrew Cuomo for help, saying the intensive-care unit capacity in some hospitals in the city are close to maxing out.
“We’re headed in the wrong direction,” she said. “Unless we have a coordinated approach across this country, we are going to continue to unnecessarily watch people die.”
Bottoms, a potential vice presidential pick for Democrat Joe Biden, has been at odds with Republican Governor Brian Kemp over the state’s response to Covid-19.
New York, once the center of the pandemic in the U.S., is in a “stable period” right now, Cuomo said.
He lauded Bottoms for her leadership, saying she’s doing “exactly the right thing” in slowing reopening plans and requiring masks to be worn. Cuomo said he would send a team down to aid Atlanta.
Cuomo said he’s talking to a few states as well, seeing what they need and the best way to get it to them.
Hong Kong Mandates $645 Fine for No Mask (12:15 p.m. NY)
Hong Kong ordered gyms and bars to close for a week, restored strict limits on public gatherings and introduced fines for anyone refusing to wear a mask on public transport in a fresh bid to prevent the resurgent coronavirus from spiraling out of control.
The tougher measures, to take effect Wednesday, include drastically limiting the number of people gathering in public back to four, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said in a press conference on Monday.
No Normal for Foreseeable Future: WHO (11:45 a.m. NY)
It would be unrealistic to expect that a perfect vaccine will become available to everyone immediately, and it’s not realistic to expect Covid-19 to disappear in the coming months, said Mike Ryan, head of the World Health Organization’s emergencies program, speaking at a briefing in Geneva.
“There will be no return to the old normal for the foreseeable future,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the organization, an agency of the United Nations.
The best way to reopen schools is to do so once countries succeed in combating the spread of the disease, Ryan said. Not enough is known about the role of children in transmission, though several recent studies suggest that children over 10 are more susceptible to infection than those under 10, said Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead officer on Covid-19.
Separately, two scientists that the WHO has sent in an advance mission to China are working remotely with local researchers as local rules require them to stay in quarantine. Learning how animals transmitted the disease will help in fighting it, Van Kerkhove said.
Arizona Reports Fewest New Cases in Two Weeks (11:40 a.m. NY)
Arizona on Monday reported 1,357 new Covid-19 cases for a total of 123,824, an increase of 1.1% that was well below the prior seven-day average of 3.2%. It was the lowest number of new cases reported in two weeks.
The Arizona Department of Health Services also reported eight new deaths, bringing the statewide toll to 2,245.
NYC to Educate Young People on Masks (10:55 a.m. NY)
New York City will redouble efforts to educate young people about the importance of wearing masks and keeping socially distant after a rise in cases among those ages 20-29.
Young adults between the ages of 20 to 29 with Covid-19 infection increased to about 35 per 100,000 during the last week in June, from about 27 per 100,000 in the first week in June, according to the city health department. The rate among those 30 to 39 remained almost flat, to about 31 per 100,000 from about 30 per 100,000 during the same time span.
While the city is celebrating its first day of no deaths from Covid-19 since the outbreak, and its hospitalization and positivity rates are stable, it sees a troubling pattern as the phased reopening of the most populous U.S. city lures people out of their homes.
“We’re going to double down and make sure that younger adults really follow precautions,” the mayor said. “We need to remind them that they are not impervious.”
De Blasio also urged President Donald Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act now to make sure all states get the supplies they need to battle the virus.
Florida Cases Rise More Than Average (10:40 a.m. NY)
Florida reported 282,435 Covid-19 cases on Monday, up 4.7% from a day earlier, compared with an average increase of 4.4% in the previous seven days. Deaths among Florida residents reached 4,277, an increase of 35, or 0.8%, according to the report, which includes data through Sunday.
The new rate of people testing positive for the first time climbed to 11.5% for Sunday, from 11.3% on Saturday.
Empire State Building Observatory to Reopen (9:12 a.m. NY)
The Empire State Building plans to reopen the observatory on July 20 under New York state’s Phase 4 guidelines. Hours of operation will be reduced for the first few weeks, and initial capacity will be cut more than 80% to only 500 guests at a time.
Top U.K. Scientists Urge Making Masks Mandatory (8:30 a.m. NY)
A group of U.K. scientists is calling on the government to make face masks mandatory in indoor spaces, as evidence on the use of coverings in preventing the spread of Covid-19 grows.
The Independent SAGE panel -- set up as an alternative to the U.K. government’s official coronavirus advisory committee -- published a report Monday petitioning for new laws to enforce the use of masks. Legislation should be accompanied by a campaign advising the public of the benefits, according to the group.
Hong Kong Tightens Measures Amid New Wave (8 a.m. NY)
Hong Kong tightened virus control measures as it battles with a new wave of local cases. These include limiting the number of people gathering in public to four from 50, and banning dine-in services at eateries from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. The moves were announced at a news conference with Chief Executive Carrie Lam. The new social-distancing measures take effect on Wednesday.
Earlier, Hong Kong reported 41 new local cases, another record high. Government officials said 21 were related to previous clusters while 20 were of unknown origins. This suggests that hidden chains of transmission have been circulating for some time as the population returned to work and social activities.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Vaccine Sales May Top $5 Billion (7:12 a.m. NY)
Moderna Inc.’s experimental vaccine for Covid-19 could generate sales of more than $5 billion a year, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee said, initiating the stock at a buy.
Chinese Ports Jammed (7 a.m. NY)
Intensive testing of meat, seafood and other products for the coronavirus has tripled customs clearance times at some major Chinese ports, raising concerns the delays could ensnare global trade flows.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), BioNTech Vaccine Candidates Fast-Tracked (6:54 a.m. NY)
Two of Pfizer and BioNTech’s four investigational mRNA-based vaccine candidates received fast track designation from the FDA. The designation was granted based on preliminary data from phase 1/2 studies that are currently ongoing in the U.S. and Germany as well as animal studies. The companies said a large, global Phase 2b/3 study may begin as early as this month.
BioNTech shares rose 5% pre-market while Pfizer gained 1.6%.
Iran’s New Cases Slightly Below Average (6:09 a.m. NY)
Iran reported 2,349 new daily cases, a 0.9% increase that is slightly below the 1% average rise from the past week. There were 203 new deaths in the past 24 hours. The country has 259,652 infections and 13,032 fatalities.
Greece Allows Flights From Sweden (6 a.m. NY)
Greece will allow direct flights from Sweden from July 22, according to government spokesman Stelios Petsas. The country will also look into allowing direct flights from non-EU countries, such as the U.S., from end of July, depending on the situation in those countries and on condition travelers have a negative test for Covid-19 carried out within 72 hours before arrival.

316,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Canadian firms warn over Mexico energy policy at dawn of trade deal,"By Dave Graham (NYSE:GHM) and David Ljunggren
MEXICO CITY/OTTAWA (Reuters) - As Mexico celebrated a new trade deal with the United States and Canada on July 1, a group of Canadian energy investors warned their government that Mexico could already be violating the agreement for failing to respect contracts.
In a letter to Canada's Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Finance Minister Bill Morneau, Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne and other officials, four companies voiced concern their Mexican investments were under threat and urged the government to press Mexico on the matter.
The letter, seen by Reuters, adds to evidence of frustration among investors over energy policy under the administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador just as Mexico is trying to revive its battered economy from the impact of coronavirus.
Canada, a longstanding ally of Mexico and one of the country's main sources of foreign direct investment (FDI), has already raised concerns about Lopez Obrador's energy policy.
Arguing that Mexico must carve out a bigger role for the state on energy policy and become more self-sufficient, Lopez Obrador says previous Mexican governments skewed the market in favor of private investors, pushing up prices for the public.
The president has sought to renegotiate billions of dollars worth of contracts to get better terms for taxpayers.
Foreign companies, which were granted more scope to invest in Mexico under a 2013-14 energy reform enacted by Lopez Obrador's predecessor, deny they have raised costs for the public. They say the government is not honoring existing deals.
In the letter,  Canadian Solar  (NASDAQ:CSIQ) Inc, Atco Ltd, Northland Power (OTC:NPIFF) Inc and JCM Power cited decisions to suspend testing of new renewable energy plants and to limit development and operation of power stations as steps that could put their projects in Mexico in jeopardy.
Mexican tribunals have temporarily suspended some of the measures, pending a Supreme Court decision. However, disputes over a range of policy decisions on energy extend back well into last year and have fanned uncertainty among investors.
Northland Power spokesman David Timm confirmed the company signed the letter but declined further comment, saying discussions are ongoing with both governments.
Ryan Nearing, spokesman for International Trade Minister Mary Ng, who was also sent the letter, said Canadian companies have indicated they are concerned with recent measures taken by the Mexican government which affect their energy investments.
""Canada shares these concerns, as Canadian companies have invested close to $9 billion in the energy sector, including over $3.1 billion in renewable energy,"" Nearing said.
Ng raised this issue on May 29 with Mexican Economy Minister Graciela Marquez and two agreed to keep up dialogue on it, Nearing added. Canada's embassy in Mexico has also been actively engaged with Mexico's government on the matter, he said.
The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment, nor did Mexico's energy ministry.
The four companies have various investments in Mexico, including solar and hydroelectric power projects.
The letter, which was also addressed to Natural Resources Minister Seamus O'Regan and Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, was dated July 1, the same day on which the trade accord known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) came into force.
Mexico's actions risked breaching commitments under USMCA and other trade deals it had signed, the firms argued.
Six weeks previously, Canada and the European Union sent letters to the Mexican government to warn that its changes on energy policy could negatively affect billions of dollars in renewable power generation projects.
In their missive, the energy companies proposed discussing what diplomatic channels could be opened to ensure that the Mexican government upheld commitments to Canadian investors.
Over the past two decades, Canada has been the third-biggest source of foreign investment in Mexico, after the United States and Spain, according to Mexican government data.

Last year, total Canadian investment was worth more than $2.9 billion, or some 8.7% of the total, the figures show.

317,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>","Want more jobs? Wear a mask, says Fed's Kaplan","(Reuters) - Widespread use of face masks is the single biggest factor that could help restore the U.S. economy, bringing more people back to work and allowing schools to open, Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan said on Monday.
""If we all wore masks, I think that's probably the most important thing we can do right now to make sure that rebound is faster, not slowing,"" Kaplan told the National Press Club in a virtual event, noting the economy has slowed since the virus has resurged across the United States in recent weeks. 
""Many small businesses that might have made it without the resurgence in the virus will not make it,"" he said.
That a U.S. central banker's main message on the economic outlook should be a plea for using a simple tool to slow infections underscores one challenge of this crisis, one that Kaplan and other Fed policymakers have pointed to from the beginning: The economy can't return to health unless the virus can be contained. 
Kaplan did say the Fed stands ready to do more, and also called for more money from lawmakers to support the unemployed and state and local governments that have begun to lay off staff amid a steep drop in tax revenue. 
But there would be less need for fiscal and monetary policy support if people wore masks, he said. 

""There is a direct connection between growing faster and following these protocols,"" Kaplan said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Streamlining anti-money laundering checks, longer central bank opening hours and linking national systems would cut cross-border payment costs, global regulators said on Monday.
Payments have come under the spotlight since Facebook (O:FB) proposed its Libra digital stablecoin, prompting central banks to think about launching their own digital currency.
A report by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures said cross border payments are set to increase from $20 trillion in 2019 to $30 trillion by 2030.
""The cost and hassle of making payments cross border discourages businesses, particularly small businesses, from entering the global market place,"" CPMI Chair Jon Cunliffe said.
For a graphic on CPMI Payments:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwwoadpw/CPMI%20Payments%20Graphic.png
But it can take 10 days for a cross-border payment to be completed and cost up to 10 times as much as a domestic one.
""It's no surprise that people turning to alternatives that may look attractive but are potentially less secure,"" Cunliffe, who is also Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, added.
The CPMI set out 19 ""building blocks"" that will take 5 years or more to put into place in the second of a three-stage process on barriers to cheaper and faster cross-border payments, 
Global regulators are due to set out later in the year for Group of 20 Economies (G20) which authorities will be responsible for implementing the steps.
Opening central bank payment infrastructure for longer would speed up payments that involve swapping two currencies to complete, the CPMI report said, adding that a centralised cross-border utility of the ""know your customer"" (KYC) data needed for anti-money laundering checks would also streamline payments.
""In some jurisdictions, the political resistance could be considerable insofar as it involves ceding authority to multinational standard setters on KYC arrangements and allowing citizens’ personal information to be accessed cross-border.""

While new technology attracts the attention, there is room for substantial improvement in existing systems, Cunliffe said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany and Italy agree in principle on proposals to bridge gaps among EU states on a long-term budget and a stimulus plan, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday, warning there was no certainty of a deal.
During a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte at a palace just outside Berlin, Merkel said she could not guarantee that EU member states will reach an agreement on the proposals by European Council President Charles Michel at a summit on July 17-18.
""I don't know if we will reach an agreement,"" said Merkel. ""It is still not sure and the path remains long.""
Michel will chair the first face-to-face talks of the 27 European Union heads since lockdowns took hold in March and feuds over how to respond to the coronavirus divided the bloc.
Hoping to overcome major differences over how to revive economic growth between the wealthy, thrifty north and the high-debt south, hit harder by COVID-19, he proposed a smaller joint EU budget for 2021-27 than previously envisaged.
Michel has presented a long-term EU budget of 1.074 trillion euros and a recovery fund of 750 billion euros for pandemic-hammered economies, with two-thirds of that to be in the form of free grants and a third issued as repayable loans.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte - the key hawkish figure in the talks - has insisted on enshrining economic reforms as conditions for accessing the funds, something the south wants to avoid.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte warned during the news conference with Merkel that EU economic stimulus for member states should not carry too much conditionality.
Conte said Italy was happy for EU institutions to monitor its economic reforms but imposing excessively stringent conditions would be counter-productive.

""It's not in anybody's interests to introduce conditionality that would compromise the support of the programme or give it scarce practical impact,"" Conte said.

320,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 01:18PM ET</span>","Data Behind Libor Shriveled Up in Crisis, BOE’s Bailey Says","(Bloomberg) -- At the height of the coronavirus pandemic, guesswork played a vital role in setting international borrowing costs.
Actual transactional data used to calculate sterling Libor all but vanished as markets became volatile, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said, adding to reasons that companies need to abandon the discredited benchmark.
Banks can submit genuine market data to set Libor, which underpins hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets around the world. Or, where these numbers are lacking, they can use their own estimates to inform submissions, in a process that challenges the benchmark’s accuracy.
“Over half of the 35 published Libor rates across all currencies contained no transaction-based submissions at all” during the week of March 16, he said. “At the same time, Libor rates, and therefore costs for borrowers, spiked upwards based on firms’ expert judgment.”
Transaction-based submissions in three-month sterling Libor dropped to zero during the week of March 16, Bailey said in a speech. The announcement underscores how guess-work effectively helped to set interest rates even as chaos engulfed financial markets.
Over the next 18 months, regulators are ushering out Libor, which underpins trillions of dollars in bonds, loans and derivatives, but has been discredited by manipulation scandals.
Bailey warned of a crackdown if banks don’t show they are moving away from Libor.
“We would not expect to see any further sterling Libor linked lending after the end of March 2021,” he said. “Regulated firms in the U.K. should expect their supervisors to monitor and discuss their progress with these important milestones.”
Regulators began phasing out the Libor benchmark after European and U.S. banks were found to have manipulated rates to benefit their own portfolios. Yet those efforts stumbled as market participants shifted attention away from the transition and toward surviving the crisis.
“Despite the array of challenges we’re facing as a result of the coronavirus, transitioning away from Libor continues to be of paramount importance,” New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) said at the event.

(Reuters) - The global pandemic that roiled markets in the spring and disrupted daily life across the world is not delaying financial regulators' plans to ditch Libor, an interest rate benchmark that was tainted with scandal after banks rigged it for years, New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) said on Monday. 
The policymaker said the timeline for phasing the rate out by the end of 2021 remained the same. He urged banks to stop using Libor in new financial contracts. 
""It doesn't matter whether you're a large global bank or a local company with a handful of employees, you need to be prepared to manage your institution's transition away from LIBOR,"" Williams said in remarks prepared for a webinar organized by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of market participants helping to implement the move to the preferred benchmark rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). ""As I've said before, let's not make the existing hole we're trying to climb out of even deeper.""
The Fed official said SOFR is a more robust benchmark rate because it is based on a higher volume of transactions than Libor. The New York Fed started publishing SOFR averages and a SOFR index in March and Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) will stop accepting adjustable rate mortgages based on Libor by the end of 2020. 

Williams did not comment on his outlook for the economy or monetary policy in his remarks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Group of Seven finance ministers on Monday called for full implementation of a G20 freeze in debt service payments by all official bilateral creditors and adherence to debt data transparency standards, a U.S. Treasury spokesperson said in a statement.
In a teleconference held early Monday, the G7 ministers also discussed domestic and international economic responses to the coronavirus pandemic and strategies to achieve a robust global recovery, a Treasury statement said.
In addressing the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative offered to the world's 73 poorest countries through the end of the year, the ministers discussed the need for China, a G20 member and major creditor, to participate fully and transparently, a senior administration official said. 
""It's key, both to realizing the full potential of the DSSI and from a transparency perspective,"" the official said.
G20 finance ministers are to discuss the debt moratorium during a teleconference on Saturday amid growing calls for an extension, given a deeper downturn in the global economy that will hit heavily indebted countries particularly hard.
The International Chamber of Commerce, the International Trade Union Confederation and a major civil society group on Monday urged G20 members to extend and expand a freeze in debt service payments.
So far, 41 countries have applied for relief under the DSSI and the Paris Club has signed agreements with 20 countries ranging from Ivory Coast to Ethiopia and Pakistan.
World Bank President David Malpass last week backed an extension of the debt payment freeze through 2021 and said some heavily indebted countries would need debt forgiveness to avert a longer ""poverty trap.""

Malpass emphasized the need for increased transparency about lending and said all official bilateral creditors, including policy banks such as China's Development Bank, and state-owned enterprises with implicit government guarantees should take part.

That’s because “measures used to contain the outbreak are unlikely to be as far-reaching as those adopted in March/April,” Praveen Korapaty, chief interest rate strategist at Goldman Sachs wrote in a July 11 client note.
U.S. consumption is expected to get back on track in September, and unless the Federal Reserve opens up to negative rates, 10-year bonds won’t have much room to rally further, he said.
Goldman’s analysis sounds a note of caution even after coronavirus concerns have fueled appetite for haven assets. The grim tallies of new cases have given investors a glimpse of a bleaker world in the second half of the year, and investors rushed into the safest securities last week.
Demand Eases
Last week’s data suggests investors are already off-loading their holdings. Outstanding positions of 10-year Treasury futures expiring in September fell 27,322 contracts in the five days through Friday, the second weekly drop since becoming the actively traded contract last month, according to the Chicago Board of Trade data.
In a further sign of easing demand, the yield on 10-year Treasuries steadied at 0.65%, after falling to 0.57% on Friday, its lowest level since April.
Five-year yields were also flat at 0.30%, after slumping to a record low last week amid haven buying as Texas, California and Florida reported record number of deaths.
Goldman held a view earlier that the Treasury yield curve would steepen, before changing it in favor of an outright sale of the 10-year bond.
The report also cites the low level of term premium -- a measure of the extra compensation investors demand to hold longer maturity bonds instead of rolling over shorter paper -- reducing the appeal of U.S. Treasuries.
Richard Kelly, head of global strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank, disputed Goldman’s analysis and said Treasuries are likely to remain in their current range. Going short on the bonds could present challenges into the end of July and August when supply goes almost to zero, he said.
“If you look under the hood you still see a very dysfunctional, unhealthy market that isn’t ready to think that everything is better,” he said.

More than half of Germany’s companies want their staff to continue to do some form of work-from-home -- even after the pandemic is over.
According to a survey by the country’s Ifo Institute, 54% of businesses want to make greater use of home offices than before the outbreak. Covid-19 led to a significant shift in how companies view the setup, with three out of four telling their employees to stay away from the office in recent months to conform with new social-distancing rules, Ifo said.
“For many companies, the adjustment involved considerable investments in digital infrastructure and new communication technology,” said Oliver Falck, an Ifo economist who co-authored the survey. “In all likelihood, this reorganization of work will not be completely reversed.”
Before the virus struck, the practice of working remotely was relatively rare in Germany, according to the report. While about 56% of employees in the country were technically able to work from home temporarily, only about half of those actually did so.
While the study suggests that might change for many workers, Ifo added that low-income and low-skilled workers are significantly less likely to be able to work remotely. It also said that a full shift into working from home remains unlikely -- businesses are more likely to adopt a hybrid model that allows a mix of remote and office-based work.

327,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 08:21AM ET</span>",Did Uncle Sam's virus aid help your credit score? Don't count on a loan,"By Anna Irrera
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rachel Levine, a New York-based office furniture saleswoman, lost her job in late March without any notice or severance pay when the coronavirus outbreak shut down most of the city. The married, 44-year-old mom is still out of work, unsure when or whether she will return to her previous job.
Despite that, Levine's credit score has risen during the pandemic. That is because she has been receiving unemployment benefits and a $600 weekly stimulus boost from the government, while other factors that usually make lenders more confident about borrowers have also worked in her favor.
""We are spending less, and credit-card companies and student-loan companies have offered a three-month pause period during the tight times,"" Levine said.
Her score rose from 720 before coronavirus to 758 now. A score above 600 is generally considered decent.
Levine is not alone: Statistics provided exclusively to Reuters by personal-finance website Credit Karma show widespread and unusual improvements in credit scores lately. Yet those gains have been a mirage of sorts, economists say, because relief programs will end before everyone can get back to work and up to date on bills.
In anticipation of a more severe downturn ahead, banks have already tightened their lending policies.
""This is very temporary,"" said Elizabeth Ananat, a professor of economics at Barnard College who focuses on poverty and income inequality.
Americans' finances might worsen more dramatically than they improved once stimulus checks stop, debt deferral programs finish and tax extensions offered by the Treasury Department expire, she said.
""Come August there will be a cliff coming in terms of people's income and, in the meantime, a lot of these forbearances that people have worked out with lenders will be ending,"" Ananat said. ""This is looking to get a lot worse pretty soon.""
Credit Karma analyzed scores for 80 million U.S. users from November to February, and from February to May. It found that 25% were able to improve their score before the pandemic, compared with 32% during the pandemic.
The gains were widespread. In the pre-coronavirus period, 30% of members with  TransUnion  (NYSE:TRU) credit scores lower than 600 improved, compared with 38% during the pandemic.
""People are missing fewer payments ... and that is allowing folks to have improved credit scores,"" Anand Devendran, Credit Karma's general manager of personal loans, said in an interview. 
Bank loan statistics tell a different story.
Outstanding U.S. consumer credit fell each month from February to May for a total 2.4% decline on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to the Federal Reserve. The last time that metric fell was December 2015.
The decline partly reflects less loan demand during the coronavirus recession, but also shows lenders pulling back.
Senior loan officers representing 38% of U.S. banks told the Fed they were tightening standards for consumer loans and credit cards during the second quarter, up from 14% of U.S. banks that said that in the first quarter. At the height of the 2007-2009 recession, 67% of banks reported tighter standards – suggesting consumer lending conditions may worsen.
The dynamic may harm people like Kelsey Pearl, a 29-year-old bartender in Portland, Oregon, whose employer closed permanently because of the pandemic.
Pearl did not have debt before the pandemic, so her score has not changed much. Government assistance has helped with bills, but once stimulus checks end Pearl will only be eligible for $200 a week in unemployment, which would not even cover her rent.
Pearl fears she will not be able to get a loan if she needs one.

""I feel very stressed about that,"" she said. ""I don't know what I am going to do.""

328,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 08:09AM ET</span>",Fed’s Support for Corporate Debt Has Been a Wall Street Bonanza,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s extraordinary effort to keep credit flowing to companies during the Covid-19 pandemic is also shunting money to banks’ bottom lines.
Fees for underwriting blue-chip U.S. company bonds in the first half of the year essentially doubled to more than $7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, after the Fed set up an unprecedented series of programs to support corporate debt markets and slashed interest rates. U.S. companies have rushed to borrow, selling more than $1 trillion of high-grade notes in just a few months, and some of the proceeds have trickled down to banks.
That boon underscores how the biggest banks’ roles as financial intermediaries can translate to billions of dollars of profits after borrowing floodgates open. When the firms start releasing their second quarter earnings on Tuesday, they’re broadly expected to post their worst results since the financial crisis as they set aside more money for bad loans. Gains from bond underwriting -- and the resulting debt trading -- are one of the few bright spots.
That fee income might be enough to turn quarterly net losses into profit for some banks, said Gerard Cassidy, an equity research analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
“The Fed’s unprecedented actions in monetary policy since the start of Covid-19 have benefited banks very well,” Cassidy said.
Short Lived?
The Fed’s efforts can only help banks so much. Debt underwriting typically accounts for only around 5% to 10% of the total money banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). make from fees, which in turn is about half their revenue, said Jesse Rosenthal, an analyst at CreditSights Inc. And the benefits may be relatively short-lived if the pace of borrowing slows down, as many strategists expect in the second half of the year.
The central bank’s efforts have helped banks in myriad ways. The Fed is buying bonds in the open market and if necessary directly from companies, which has helped slash yields on investment-grade corporate bonds to the lowest level on record. That’s spurring companies to borrow, which is lifting underwriting fees for both investment-grade and high-yield debt. When companies sell bonds, investors often sell older securities from the corporation and buy newer ones, so trading revenue rises too.
On top of that, the Federal Reserve offered financing to banks that make loans under the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, making it easier for banks to earn fees from that program. Many didn’t even tap the Fed’s facility, because they’ve been flooded with customer deposits. Loans under that program are U.S. guaranteed, meaning the banks don’t have any risk of borrowers defaulting.
“The PPP program has been a windfall for the banks at taxpayers’ expense, even if some are donating the fees to worthy causes,” said Anat Admati, a professor at Stanford University Graduate School of Business.
The Fed is also taking steps including buying short-term corporate bonds known as commercial paper directly from companies. And as of last week, its Main Street Lending Program, aimed at small and mid-sized businesses, was fully up and running. The Fed will buy 95% of each loan made under the up-to-$600 billion program, which could generate around $5.5 billion of fees for banks if there’s full uptake, according to a Bloomberg analysis.
Underwriting Is Key
The biggest gains to banks have come from underwriting so many bonds. In addition to U.S. investment-grade bonds, dollar high-yield note sales have jumped too, with underwriting fees there rising about 50% to $1.96 billion in the first half of 2020, according to Bloomberg data.
These gains from underwriting are not just happening in the U.S. Central banks globally have been opening the money spigots to try to jump start the economy during the pandemic, spurring companies worldwide to borrow.
A wide range of companies that had put off borrowing earlier this year when markets were tumultuous ended up selling bonds in the second quarter. T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc. sold $19 billion of investment-grade bonds in April to help finance its acquisition of Sprint Corp. United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc. sold nearly $4 billion of notes in June to help keep itself afloat.
The increase in capital markets fees speaks to the strength of diversification at the banks, which have set aside more money to cover expected losses on loans, said Robert Smalley, a credit desk analyst at UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG).
“Debt underwriting fees really help counterbalance some of that,” he said. “But overall net income for the banks, like we saw in the first quarter, will be down materially year-over-year.”
Benefit for Banks
For example, JPMorgan Chase, which posts results on Tuesday, posted about a $140 million increase in debt underwriting fees to $1.1 billion in the first quarter. That activity spurred record trading results and helped offset $820 million of markdowns on bridge loans.
June was the busiest month ever for junk bond sales. Investment-grade borrowers surpassed all of 2019 volume by mid-June.
“It has been an incredibly intense four months because we were trying to bring so many companies to market,” said Richard Zogheb, Global Head of Debt Capital Markets at Citigroup Inc. “I have a wife and a little guy here and they thought, ‘This is going to be great, we’re going to see you so much more,’ and frankly they’ve probably seen me less.”
Workdays typically lasted at least 12 hours and he rarely left his home office except to get something to drink or to use the bathroom, he added.
Companies have borrowed in the bond market to raise money to help tide them over during the crisis, and to refinance debt, including money they borrowed on revolving lines of credit. Many decided to refinance existing bonds early, while they could and while rates for some borrowers were relatively cheap, rather than wait for the second half of 2020 and or even 2021.
“I would expect we’ll get a slowdown in the second half of the year,” said David Del Vecchio, portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income.

How much volumes fall in the second half of the year depends on how the pandemic proceeds, Citigroup’s Zogheb said. If the virus is brought under control, companies could turn their attention to acquisition financing and sponsors could pursue new leveraged buyouts, which could lead to a more normal level of issuance, he said.
But if there are flare-ups or a second wave, then acquisitions would likely remain on hold, Zogheb said. Companies could raise new bonds for more liquidity, he said. But it probably won’t happen at the same pace as in the first half, because many companies raised enough cash earlier this year to fund them through another wave of the virus.

329,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 08:05AM ET</span>",Apple to spend more than $400 million of $2.5 billion California housing fund this year,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Monday said it has allocated more than $400 million of $2.5 billion it pledged last year to stem California's housing crisis.
The iPhone maker in November committed the funding to address what Chief Executive Tim Cook called a housing ""affordability crisis that is existential"" for many residents of the company's home state.
The majority of the first $400 million to be spent this year is going toward two programs Apple is working on with the California Housing Finance Agency. Under the first, Apple has provided funding to help state officials extend their ability to finance affordable housing projects with tax-exempt bonds. 
Under the second, Apple has worked through the agency to help provide mortgage and down payment assistance to hundreds of first-time home buyers to date. The mortgage assistance program is aimed at low- and moderate-income first-time home buyers.
Apple said that it is also working with a public-private group called Housing Trust Silicon Valley to start work on four projects in the San Francisco Bay area that will create 250 new units of affordable housing, many of them reserved for veterans, the homeless or formerly homeless, and residents with developmental disabilities.
Apple is also providing funding to a public-private group called Destination: Home, addressing Silicon Valley's homelessness crisis. The two said Apple support has helped fund 1,000 new units of housing, including a 70-unit project in Santa Clara designed for seniors experiencing homelessness or at risk of it. The Apple funding also helped expand a program that the group said helped keep 1,500 families from losing their homes.

“We were able to immediately invest their funding into several new housing developments that will provide a permanent home to vulnerable residents across the region and reinforce our homelessness prevention system at a time when we’re seeing an unprecedented number of at-risk families in need,"" Jennifer Loving, Destination: Home’s chief executive, said in a statement.

331,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>",IMF slashes Middle East and Central Asia growth forecasts,"By Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised downwards its growth projections for the Middle East and Central Asia as economies were hurt worse than expected by the double blow of lower oil prices and the coronavirus crisis.
The region, which includes around 30 countries spanning from Mauritania to Kazakhstan, will see real, or inflation-adjusted, gross domestic product (GDP) fall by 4.7% this year, 2 percentage points lower than IMF forecasts in April, the fund said in a report on Monday.
The pandemic has hit sectors such as tourism and trade, while low oil prices and crude production cuts have strained the finances of regional oil exporters and impacted remittances.
""These factors have led to a stronger-than-anticipated impact on activity in the first half of 2020, and the recovery is expected to be more gradual than previously forecast, in line with a weaker global recovery,"" the IMF said.
After portfolio outflows estimated at between $6 billion and $8 billion in March alone, uncertainty around the length of the pandemic could expose the region to further market volatility and curb governments' ability to refinance some $21 billion in debt due in the second half of this year, said the fund.
Worsening inequality and rising unemployment could trigger social unrest and political instability, while a potential decline in expatriate workers - often the large majority of the workforce in oil-exporting countries - could dampen recovery.
The overall growth revision was led by subdued activity among oil exporters in the Middle East, North Africa, Pakistan, and Afghanistan region, with oil export receipts expected to decline by over $270 billion this year compared with 2019.
Growth in the Caucasus and Central Asia was revised to a smaller extent, partly because of lower oil production cuts.
Energy producers in the Gulf will see real GDP fall by 7.1% this year, down from April forecasts of a drop of nearly 3%, the fund estimates, but slightly less than the 7.6% contraction the IMF had predicted at the end of June.

""Some of the high-frequency indicators that came showed a better second quarter for certain countries and therefore we have adjusted upward our projections. This is because of some improvement in the non-oil sector,"" Jihad Azour, director of the IMF's Middle East and Central Asia Department, told Reuters.

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's $3 trillion bid to stave off an economic crisis in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak is fuelling excesses across U.S. capital markets.
The U.S. central bank has pledged unlimited financial asset purchases to sustain market liquidity, increasing its balance sheet from $4.2 trillion in February to $7 trillion today. 
While the vast majority of these purchases have been limited to U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, the Fed's pledge to bolster the corporate bond market has been enough to spur a frenzy among investors for bonds and stocks. 
""COVID-19 is now inversely related to the markets. The worse that COVID-19 gets, the better the markets do because the Fed will bring in stimulus. That is what has been driving markets,"" said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance. 
Here are some of the market bubbles that investors are attributing to the Federal Reserve's intervention.
STOCK MARKET BONANZA
The Federal Reserve has not bought stocks as part of its financial stimulus programs. But its near-zero interest rates and credit support for large swathes of Corporate America have driven yield-hungry investors back to the equity market.

Since their bottom on March 23, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have both risen more than 40% and the Nasdaq composite has gained nearly 60%. The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio is currently 21.5, a level last seen during the dot-com boom 20 years ago.

IPO FRENZY
The stock market euphoria has spilled over into initial public offerings (IPOs) and other stock sales to investors. 
A record $184 billion was raised in U.S. equity capital markets in the second quarter, according to Refinitiv IFR data. Over $8.9 billion worth of IPOs in the second quarter priced above the target range, the highest amount since the third quarter of 2014, according to Dealogic.
""Why anyone would buy Nissans at Bentley prices is beyond me, but that's what happens generally with any sexy IPO. Sure the Nissan (OTC:NSANY) has 4 wheels and it's fine transportation, but is it worth a Bentley valuation?"" said Richard Bernstein, chief investment officer at Richard Bernstein Advisors. 
(For IPOs priced above predicted range graphic see: https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/FEDERALRESERVE-MARKETS/ygdvzweezpw/FEDERALRESERVE-MARKETS.jpg)
DEBT BINGE
The Fed's bond-buying programs encouraged companies to tap credit markets and made the second quarter the busiest ever for debt issuance. 
(For quarterly U.S. corporate bond issuance graphic see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2W2BCS3)
Some $1.2 trillion of investment-grade paper was sold in the first half of the year, the highest issuance volume recorded by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. Even though the Fed refrained from buying most junk-rated bonds, issuance was at $200 billion through June, more than double last year's rate. 
""Investment grade and high yield bonds had an incredible quarter in terms of issuance and performance. We just continue to see more and more money flow into those markets,"" said Ted Swimmer, head of capital markets at Citizen's Commercial Banking. 
""But there's been so much new issuance in the second quarter, you get concerned you're not going to see a ton of new issuance in the third quarter.""
(For annual volume of U.S. corporate debt offerings graphic see: https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/FEDERALRESERVEMARKET/gjnpwwrnjpw/chart.png)
The premiums investors demand for holding riskier corporate debt over safer Treasury bonds, or credit spreads, narrowed sharply in the second quarter. On March 23, investors were paid the highest premium in 11 years to hold junk-rated debt, as measured by the ICE/BofA high-yield index. That number nearly halved by the end of the second quarter.
Investment-grade debt, using the equivalent ICE/BofA index has recovered almost fully from 401 basis points on March 23 to 152 basis points today.

Investing.com --  The coronavirus continues to spread unchecked in the U.S. and across much of the developed world. Stocks are set to open higher as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) raises its profit forecast for the S&P 500 ahead of the Q2 earnings season, although  Pepsico  (NASDAQ:PEP) demurred in its latest update.  The zloty is weakening slightly after conservative President Andrzej Duda won another term, and oil prices slid on the prospect of OPEC and its allies preparing to let more oil back into the market from next month. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, July 13th. 
1. Virus spreads faster; Trump dons a mask
The World Health Organization registered a new daily record high for the number of new cases of Covid-19 at the weekend at over 230,000. The U.S. registered a new daily record of over 70,000 infections on Friday, while Florida alone registered over 15,000 new cases – more than New York at the height of the virus’ first wave in April.
The White House sought to distance itself from Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, after the latter repeatedly warned about the inadequacy of the U.S.’s response to the virus in recent weeks.
At the same time, President Donald Trump wore a face mask in public for the first time after weeks of refusing to do so and mocking his opponents for doing so.
2. Chipmakers Analog and Maxim to merge
 Analog Devices  (NASDAQ:ADI) is to merge with Maxim Integrated (NASDAQ:MXIM) in an all-stock deal that will be the biggest in the U.S. so far this year.
The merger will create a company with a market value of some $70 billion and annual revenue of around $8 billion. It is the latest combination in a sector that has seen rapid consolidation in its top tier in the last five years.
Under the terms of the deal, Maxim shareholders will own around one-third of the company.
The two companies are both major players in analog semiconductors, whose applications include power management for automotive batteries. Their biggest rival, according to The Wall Street Journal, will be Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN).
3. Stocks set to open higher as Goldman ups forecast; Pepsi silent on outlook
U.S. stock markets are poised to open higher, shrugging off reports of the further spread of the coronavirus amid confidence that the upcoming earnings season won’t force investors to take a bleaker view of the outlook for major companies.
Goldman Sachs strategists have revised their baseline forecast for 2020 earnings per share at S&P 500 companies up to $115 from $110 previously, according to a note released at the weekend. David Kostin’s team stressed that outlooks, rather than historical figures, will be particularly important during the coming earnings season.
Pepsico, which reported earlier, ducked the challenge, failing to provide a financial outlook for the year beyond reiterating its previous assurances on shareholder payouts.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 139 points, or 0.5%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.6%.
4. Zloty weakens slightly on Duda's re-election
The Polish zloty weakened slightly after incumbent President Andrzej Duda, standing for the conservative Law and Justice party, was re-elected by a narrow margin, in what was seen as a popular vindication of the party’s economic record.

Crude oil prices slid on the prospect of OPEC and its allies partially turning the taps back on at the end of the month.
Under the emergency deal on output restraint agreed during the pandemic by the so-called “OPEC+” bloc, the amount of oil being withheld from world markets is set to drop from 9.7 million barrels a day to 7.7 million b/d at the end of July.
Officials from Russia have indicated that they see no need to diverge from that timetable, which is likely to be re-endorsed at a technical monitoring meeting later this week.

Germany, Europe's biggest pork producer and home to 1,500 varieties of sausage, has seen meat consumption decline for years as people buy less of it driven by health reasons and concerns for animal welfare. 
The coronavirus pandemic may have added a further reason to the list, after outbreaks at slaughterhouses and meat packing plants drew the public's attention to the industry's use of subcontracted workers from eastern Europe who live in cramped accommodation.
""We see a trend away from very cheap meat and towards higher quality and substitute products,"" said Robert Kecskes, an analyst from the market research company GfK.
""It is not only about animal welfare, it is about human welfare, and that will become entrenched in people's minds.
In this respect, the meat industry will definitely have a hard time in the near future.""
Some 600,000 people around Guetersloh, in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, were forced back into lockdown on June 23 after more than 1,500 workers at the Toennies slaughterhouse and meat packing plant tested positive for COVID-19.
The plant has provisionally been ordered to close until July 17. Health and safety officials continue to inspect it and are negotiating with the company over a proposed new hygiene plan.
On Sunday, Toennies came under fire from politicians for requesting government support to cover quarantined workers' pay.
German Agriculture Minister Kloeckner announced after the outbreak plans for a raft of measures to address what she calls the ""serious consequences"" of downward meat price pressures on animal welfare, working conditions and farmers' incomes, even at the risk of driving business abroad.
Sales of processed meat have steadily fallen in Germany in the last five years, according to market data firm Euromonitor, while sales of meat substitutes have risen 12% over the same period to $234 million in 2019.
Ruegenwalder Muehle, a company that previously specialised in cold cuts but has transformed itself into Germany's biggest producer of meat substitutes, said sales of its vegetarian and vegan products had jumped 50% so far this year, after a rise of 44% in 2019.
Germany has a long tradition of environmentalism and the Greens party has soared in the polls in recent years to overtake the Social Democrats as the country's second most popular, with latest surveys putting them on about 19%.
The number of vegetarians in Germany has doubled in the last five years to about 7% of the population, with vegans making up 2%, while almost a third of households are trying to reduce their meat consumption, according to GfK.
Joerg Erchinger, a butcher in the Prenzlauer Berg area of Berlin, said most of his customers opt for his products because he offers exclusively meat from humanely farmed animals.
""The continuous availability has caused customers to stop thinking about where their meat, their cucumbers, their fruit and their vegetables come from, and that has made it an everyday product like a box of screw or nails,"" he told Reuters TV.

But, he said, some people simply want an ""honest sausage"".

Germany’s economy continues to recover following the easing of coronavirus-related restrictions, but remains well below capacity, according to a government report.
“The economic recovery is still at the beginning,” the economy ministry said Monday. “Capacities are still clearly under-used.”
While the recovery began in May, the second quarter will still show negative growth.
“Only in the third quarter will gross domestic product register positive rates again,” the ministry said in a statement.
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s administration has launched a 130-billion euro ($147 billion) stimulus plan that includes tax incentives, aid for childcare and municipal governments as well as spending on cleaner energy and digitalization, to help pull the country out of its worst recession since the end of World War II. Short-term initiatives include a temporary cut in value-added tax and a cash bonus for parents of 300 euros per child.
The package of measures will raise 218 billion euros in new debt this year.
According to preliminary figures from the labor ministry, some 6 million workers were enrolled in the government’s short-term employment program in May, down from 6.8 million a month earlier.
Germany’s economy is projected to contract by more than 6% this year due to the fallout from the coronavirus crisis.

The Events Industry Alliance (EIA), an industry body that represents the UK events sector, said companies would need at least eight to twelve weeks to restart exhibitions, calling on the government to set a date for reopening.
The coronavirus outbreak and the ensuing lockdown led to widespread cancellations and postponement of events to later this year or until 2021. The threat of a second wave of COVID-19 cases triggered further uncertainty about reopening plans worldwide. 
""The exhibitions sector is a vital enabler of economic activity in almost every sector of the UK economy and failure to provide a go-live date impacts the ability of almost 180,000 businesses to recover,"" said Chris Skeith, chief executive officer, Association of Event Organisers.
An estimated 60% of the sector's supply chain will not reopen in October, when the government's job-supporting furlough scheme ends, the EIA added.
Britain's finance ministry had said it spent more than 25 billion pounds ($30.72 billion) on a furlough programme that is supporting 9.3 million jobs.
Earlier this month, the ministry also promised an additional 30 billion pounds to head off an unemployment crisis, funnelling money to employers, homebuyers and beleaguered hospitality firms to drive a recovery.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic will force the Bank of Japan to embrace big data as its conventional consumer price index fails to offer an accurate, real-time picture on inflation, said Tsutomu Watanabe, a leading academic on alternative data in Japan.
The BOJ pledges to achieve 2% inflation as measured by the government's consumer price index (CPI), which means its policy decisions are closely linked to fluctuations in the index.
That approach will need to change as government data are released too late to give policymakers clues on how the pandemic is affecting the economy in real-time, Watanabe told Reuters.
""The BOJ would be behind the curve on policy if it relies too heavily on data that comes out late"" such as CPI, said Watanabe, a former BOJ official who is professor at the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Economics.
""The BOJ knows its conventional approach of simply tracking CPI won't work. While they won't change the 2% target, they will start looking at a wider range of data,"" he said on Monday.
The BOJ has deployed years of aggressive stimulus to achieve its 2% CPI target to get the world's third-largest economy sustainably out of deflation.
The most recent CPI data was for May, when core consumer prices fell 0.2% from a year earlier. It was released on June 19.
Japan has been slow to embrace non-traditional data, such as those for credit card usage and smartphone traffic, even as a supplement to government data in policy decisions.
Watanabe, who first introduced in Japan an index tracking real-time price moves using private data, said non-traditional data will play a crucial role as long as the pandemic persists.
""It may take about two years for a vaccine to be developed and distributed widely. During that period, traditional data like gross domestic product won't be of much use,"" he said.

""Policymakers will have to fully rely on big data. That's already happening across the world and will only accelerate.""

All the countries involved would contribute to reimbursing the debt, even northern countries dubbed ""frugal"", she said on Monday in an interview with Belgian radio station RTBF. 
""It is not like the Netherlands is providing charity to Spain or France,"" Gonzalez said. Each country would take a share of the debt proportional to its economic weight, she said. 
Germany would contribute 20%, Spain 9% and the Netherlands 6%, for instance, said Gonzalez. 
The 27 European Union leaders are due to meet later this week to negotiate the seven-year EU budget and the creation of a 750 billion euro ($849.45 billion) stimulus fund financed with common debt.
Two-thirds of the amount would be transferred in form of free grants and a third in repayable loans.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Corporate travel agents are using the coronavirus-induced lull in bookings to work with companies on how to get their staff out of Zoom videoconferences and safely back in the air.
They are launching new tools to provide on-the-ground information about local mask requirements, social distancing regulations and quarantine rules, as well as details of hotel, airline and ground-transport hygiene. 
Travellers are moving away from cheaper online bookings to seek counsel from experienced consultants amid a slow but growing rebound in the corporate travel industry, which normally accounts for $1.4 trillion of annual spending.
""I am seeing a trend now starting to pick up ... We can Zoom or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) meetings but nothing beats the face to face,"" said Jo Sully, regional general manager Asia-Pacific at  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) Global Business Travel.
""I think it will be a gradual recovery in terms of that. People will maybe think 'Should I just do this via Zoom?' but the overall response is people will go back to travelling for meetings,"" the Sydney-based executive said.
Her firm predicts a return to around 60%-70% of usual volumes in 2021, with pre-pandemic travel levels taking until 2022 or 2023.
New Zealand, which emerged from lockdown in May, is already back to half of last year's domestic booking levels, said Jamie Pherous, managing director of Brisbane-based Corporate Travel Management Ltd (CTM) (AX:CTD). 
""There is pent-up demand,"" he said. ""I was visiting some customers (in Australia) and the key feedback I get is that we've got critical decisions building that I can never resolve over a video conference.""
A CTM survey found 90% of its customers in Australia and New Zealand had experienced a negative impact on business growth due to their inability to travel.
Chinese domestic bookings are around 60% of pre-pandemic levels and some European markets have begun to pick up as border restrictions there ease, said Chris Galanty, the London-based global chief executive of  Flight Centre  Travel Group Ltd's (AX:FLT) corporate divisions.
""As countries get control of the actual health crisis and the number of COVID cases stabilise and local policy enables travel – i.e. lockdowns end and people can physically travel - business travel picks up,"" he said. 
""It doesn't pick up to pre-COVID levels. It picks up to reasonable amounts in domestic and local regions.""
Among other factors slowing the return of business travel is the disruption to the corporate events calendar and the need for companies to be stricter about approving trips, with duty of care to staff for now trumping price, said Akshay Kapoor, CWT senior director, multinational customer group, Asia Pacific.
""If I'm looking to travel the company is going to be asking me to go through many levels of approval,"" the Singapore-based executive said. 

""That element of pre-trip approvals is going up. The companies are keeping a very close eye on the purpose of travel and if people have to travel making sure they know where they are and they are safe.""

341,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>","Pause, reflect: Five questions for the ECB","By Dhara Ranasinghe and Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - For the first time in months, the European Central Bank has reason to break from crisis-fighting mode -- economic activity is picking up after the COVID-19 hit, markets are stable and agreement on an European recovery fund appears close.
Yet the future is uncertain and Thursday's meeting could see lively debate on what's next for the emergency bond buying program it ramped up in June.
""We're getting to the third phase of the crisis response,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) head of rates and credit research Christoph Rieger, said. ""The first phase saw the ECB in denial, the second phase was a 'whatever it takes' moment. The third phase is about reflection.""
Here are five key questions for markets.
1. What will the ECB discuss?
ECB chief economist Philip Lane recently suggested the bank is on hold after delivering stimulus three times this year. 
Its emergency asset purchases should cover this year's jump in net euro zone sovereign bond issuance, estimated at around 600 billion euros after redemptions.
So it may now review those purchases and the degree of flexibility that should be applied in coming months. 
While pressure for more stimulus has eased, expect the ECB to keep a dovish tone. 
Graphic: The ECB's QE program https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjpqeleapx/Pasted%20image%201594378027120.png 
2. Could the ECB hold back spending the whole PEPP envelope?
As the economy stabilises, some ECB board members have suggested the entire Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme ""envelope"" - recently boosted to 1.35 trillion euros ($1.52 trillion) - might not be spent. 
The challenge for ECB chief Christine Lagarde is to acknowledge that data is improving but reiterate her strong commitment to stimulus, given the full extent of unemployment and corporate bankruptcies may become clear only later.
""Not to do so would be damaging for markets and ECB credibility,"" says ING senior rates strategist Antoine Bouvet.
The Italian/German 10-year bond-yield gap narrowed sharply after June's aggressive action, stabilising around 170 bps (DE10IT10=RR). 
Graphic: Euro zone bond markets during the coronavirus crisis https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwvkamakvm/Pasted%20image%201594377945248.png 
3. How is growth and inflation faring against ECB expectations?
The ECB expects the economy to shrink by 8.7% in 2020 before growing 5.2% in 2021, and Lagarde reckons the worst is ""probably past"". 
Inflation is projected at or near zero for the rest of 2020, but the ECB might take comfort from a long-term market-based inflation gauge  rising back above 1%, even if it's below the near-2% target. 
Annual inflation accelerated to 0.3% in June from just 0.1% in May, supporting ECB expectations that a negative reading may be avoided.
Graphic: Euro zone inflation expectations perk up https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklpyzrznvg/Pasted%20image%201594377802976.png 
4. Could TLTROs become a more permanent part of the toolkit?
Possibly. Banks borrowed a record 1.31 trillion euros at last month's ECB offering of cheap, long-term loans. Some believe that mortgage loans might be included in future TLTROs. 
Launched six yeas ago, targeted-longer term refinancing operations were redesigned this year, allowing banks cash at rates as low as minus 1%. 
Markets are also keen to hear whether the multiplier on tiered rates could rise. This exempts banks from an effective penalty due to negative rates on excess reserves at the ECB. Any action here will likely be linked to the deposit rate, which is unlikely to be cut again soon . 
""For now, the ECB may consider that it has already been very generous to banks via the TLTRO,"" said Anatoli Annenkov, senior European economist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
Graphic: ECB Long-Term Refinancing Operations https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgporblkvd/ecbTLTRO2406.PNG 
5. Could the ECB buy more supranational debt?
With EU leaders meeting on July 17-18 to reach agreement on a 750 billion-euro recovery fund, the ECB could be asked if it will lift the share of supranational bonds it buys, currently at 10% for public sector purchases.
The European Investment Bank currently accounts for 43% of the ECB-eligible pool of supranational debt. But the EU could overtake that, even if the recovery fund proposal is watered down.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is urging businesses and individuals to prepare for the Dec. 31 end of the Brexit transition period with an information campaign titled: ""The UK's new start: let's get going.""
Britain left the European Union on Jan. 31, three and a half years after a referendum, but a transition period has delayed any major change in the relationship.
The two sides have been working to agree a trade deal ahead of that period expiring at the end of the year.
Cabinet Minister Michael Gove said on Sunday progress was being made in talks but there were still divisions.
""At the end of this year we are leaving the single market and Customs Union regardless of the type of agreement we reach with the EU,"" he said. ""This will bring changes and significant opportunities for which we all need to prepare.""
The information campaign will launch on Monday, the government said, with ads appearing on TV, radio, billboards and online. 
A survey from lobby group the Institute of Directors (IoD) said only a quarter of companies were fully ready for the end of the transition period.
Nearly half of 978 company directors polled in late June said they were not able to prepare right now, with one in seven distracted by the coronavirus and almost a third saying they needed details of changes to be clear, the IoD said. 
""With so much going on, many directors feel that preparing for Brexit proper is like trying to hit a moving target,"" said IoD Director General Jonathan Geldart. ""Jumping immediately into whatever comes next would be a nightmare for many businesses.""

The campaign targets Britons intending to travel to the EU from Jan. 1, importers and exporters, UK nationals abroad, and EU, European Economic Area and Swiss nationals living in Britain.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan said on Monday that Seiichi Shimizu, currently head of its markets department, will become head of the bank's department overseeing monetary policy drafting.
Shimizu will replace incumbent Takeshi Kato, who will become head of the BOJ's branch in Nagoya, central Japan, with both appointments effecting from July 20.
During his stint as head of the markets department, Shimizu played a key role in implementing measures to ease market strains caused by the coronavirus pandemic, such as the expansion of the BOJ's dollar swap lines with other central banks.
With experience in bank monitoring and international affairs, Shimizu will oversee one of the BOJ's most important departments, charged with drafting monetary policy and assisting the nine-member board in communicating policy intentions.
The BOJ eased monetary policy in March and April, focusing on steps to calm markets and ease corporate funding strains triggered by the pandemic. It is expected to keep policy steady at a two-day rate review ending on Wednesday.

With crisis-response measures now in place, the BOJ's next challenge is to cushion the pandemic's impact on the economy and to ensure Japan does not slip back into deflation - a task made difficult by a dearth of policy tools, analysts say.

Blockchain, a digital ledger of transactions, leaped to prominence as the technology that underpins the first digital currency, bitcoin. It has since attracted global attention because it can be used to track, record and transfer assets across all industries.
To spur further industry development, MAS and Temasek said it would make some of the technical specifications for the prototype network available to the public.

The legislation, which punishes secession subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, has further strained relations between the United States and China.
The Amcham survey, published on Monday and to which 183 or 15% of its members responded on July 6-9, showed 36.6% of respondents were ""somewhat"" concerned and 51% were ""extremely concerned"" about the legislation.
More than two-thirds of the respondents were more concerned than a month ago, when the full details of the law, which came into force just before the anniversary of the former British colony's return to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, were unveiled.
The legislation, which sees a Chinese intelligence agency openly operating in the city for the first time and gives police and mainland agents broad powers beyond the scrutiny of courts, raises a broad spectrum of worries for U.S. companies.
Some 65% were concerned about the ""ambiguity in its scope and enforcement"" and roughly 61% were concerned about the independence of Hong Kong's judicial system.
About half were concerned about the city's status as a global finance centre and the erosion of the high degree of autonomy it was promised 23 years ago.
Other major concerns cited were data security, talent drain and retaliatory measures by other governments. The prospect of extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party, was considered a ""game changer"" by about 46%, with 17% saying it wasn't.
About 49% said the law would have a negative impact on their business, while some 13% said it would have a positive impact. Some 30% considered moving capital, assets or business out of Hong Kong in the medium-to-long term, while 5% said they consider doing so in the short-term.
More than half of the respondents said they felt less safe about living and working in Hong Kong. Also about half said they personally considered leaving the city.

LONDON (Reuters) - Companies around the world will take on as much as $1 trillion of new debt in 2020, as they try to shore up their finances against the coronavirus, a new study of 900 top firms has estimated. 
The unprecedented increase will see total global corporate debt jump by 12% to around $9.3 trillion, adding to years of accumulation that has left the world's most indebted firms owing as much as many medium-sized countries. 
Last year also saw a sharp 8% rise, driven by mergers and acquisitions, and by firms borrowing to fund share buybacks and dividends. But this year's jump will be for an entirely different reason - preservation as the virus saps profits. 
""COVID has changed everything,"" said Seth Meyer, a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, the firm that compiled the analysis for a new corporate debt index. ""Now it is about conserving capital and building a fortified balance sheet"".
Companies tapped bond markets for $384 billion between January and May, and Meyer estimates that recent weeks have set a new record for debt issuance from riskier ""high yield"" firms with lower credit ratings. 
Lending markets had slammed shut for all but the most trusted firms in March, but have been opened up wide again by emergency corporate debt buying programmes from central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan.
Companies included in the new debt index already owe almost 40% more than they did in 2014, and growth in debt has comfortably outstripped growth in profits. 
Pre-tax profits for the same group of 900 companies have risen a collective 9.1% to $2.3 trillion. Gearing, a measure of debt relative to shareholder finance, hit a record 59% in 2019, while the proportion of profit devoted to servicing interest payments also rose to a new high.
U.S. companies owe almost half of the world’s corporate debt at $3.9 trillion and have seen the fastest increase in the last five years of any major economy with the exception of Switzerland where there has been a wave of major M&A deals.
Germany comes in at number two at $762 billion. It also has three of the world's most indebted firms including the most indebted, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), which with $192 billion of debt is not far behind countries like South Africa or Hungary, though it is inflated by its car finance arm. 
In contrast, a quarter of the companies in the new index have no debt at all, and some have vast cash reserves. The biggest of these stands at $104 billion and belongs to Google’s owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Meyer said credit markets still had some way to go to get back to pre-COVID conditions and the ongoing threat of the virus, especially the recent surge in U.S. cases, remained investors' central concern.
""It is all a recipe for a more challenged outlook than we thought two months ago,"" he said.

Steps against Hong Kong's financial system risk hurting U.S., Western and Hong Kong companies and consumers, according to the report https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-weighs-limited-options-to-punish-china-over-hong-kong-11594576800?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=10, citing U.S. officials and analysts. 
Measures like more targeted sanctions against Chinese officials and trade moves against products made in Hong Kong would have little impact on Beijing's integration of the city into the mainland's political and security system, the Journal added. 
On Thursday, Trump administration officials discussed Hong Kong plans in a White House meeting, people familiar with the gathering told the Journal. Officials will regroup early this week and may announce sanctions or other measures, one person added.
Washington last week imposed sanctions on the autonomous region of Xinjiang's Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, a member of China's powerful Politburo, and three other officials.
Beijing described the sanctions as ""deeply detrimental"" to mutual relations between the countries and warned that China would impose reciprocal measures on U.S. officials and organizations. 
As bilateral tensions escalate over matters ranging from the coronavirus, trade, the new Hong Kong security law and allegations of human rights violations against Uighurs in the Xinjiang region, the U.S. government alerted American citizens on Saturday to ""exercise increased caution"" in China. 
Earlier, a Bloomberg report said Trump's top advisers weighed proposals to undermine the Hong Kong currency's peg to the U.S. dollar, although the idea did not appear to have gained traction. 

Chinese state lenders were revamping contingency plans over the threat of U.S. sanctions, according to a Reuters report last week.

In an open letter to be published Monday, the groups said further steps were needed since the global economy was facing an even deeper downturn than projected in April, when the G20 and Paris Club of creditors announced a freeze in debt service payments for the world's 73 poorest countries through year-end.
Top global finance officials last week said debt restructuring may be needed on a country-by-country basis to help heavily indebted countries hit hard by the outbreak.
So far, 41 countries have applied for relief from debt servicing under the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), and the Paris Club has signed agreements with 20 countries ranging from Ivory Coast to Ethiopia and Pakistan.
But many countries not eligible for the moratorium are also at risk of debt distress given the shocks caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak, the group said.
They urged the major economies to boost contributions to enable the International Monetary Fund to continue providing debt service relief to its poorest members through April 2022, and to create similar instruments at regional multilateral development banks.
They also supported a request by debtor nations, which called for the creation of voluntary central credit facilities that would serve as senior debt instruments. These facilities would collect all interest and principal payments, with equal treatment of creditors in the form of proportional interest in the facility.

KUWAIT (Reuters) - Kuwait's government formally submitted a public debt law to parliament on Sunday which would allow it to borrow 20 billion dinars ($65 billion) over 30 years, including 8 billion dinars to help finance the current budget deficit, a legislator said.
The government and parliament have long been at odds over the law which would allow Kuwait to tap international debt, but the issue has gained urgency in recent months as the oil-exporting nation has been hit by low crude prices and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Safaa al-Hashem, head of parliament's financial and economic committee, announced details of the request while reiterating criticism of the government for not outlining investment plans and failing to diversify state revenues away from oil.
""The country is drowning in economic problems that need to be addressed,"" she said in parliament after a meeting with officials from the finance ministry and Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), which manages two sovereign wealth funds.
""What is the government plan for investment spending?""
Kuwait has been drawing down its General Reserve Fund to plug the deficit, which the International Monetary Fund estimates could reach more than 11% of gross domestic product this year, compared with a 4.8% surplus last year.
Hashem said the fund only had 1.1 billion dinars left.
Reuters could not immediately reach the government for comment. It has previously said Kuwait has plans for economic reform and diversification, but that lawmakers often block them, particularly if they are unpopular.
The Future Generations Fund, which automatically receives 10% of state oil revenue each year and has only been drawn down once, during the first Gulf War, accounted for about $489 billion of KIA's estimated total assets of $527 billion at the end of March, according to Fitch Ratings estimates.
A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters on Sunday that the state was considering selling assets of the General Reserve Fund to the Future Generations Fund as one alternative to plug the deficit.

""We have to find a compromise because we must extend it,"" Pelosi said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""
The top Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives has said it would not be productive to extend the extra unemployment benefits that were included in coronavirus relief legislation earlier this year. The benefits expire on July 31.
Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and other Republicans point to statistics showing many Americans receive more money from the extended unemployment benefits than they earned when they were at work.
Republicans and Democrats have been debating how to help the country recover from the economic effects of the novel coronavirus, which led to business closures that have thrown tens of millions of Americans out of work.
The loss of the safety net of $600 per week payments to laid off workers looms well before a sustained recovery is likely to take hold from the sudden and deep recession brought by the coronavirus, which has infected nearly 3 million Americans. 
Democrats in the U.S. Senate, impatient with the pace of Republican deliberations on additional coronavirus aid, have proposed long-term extensions to a temporary unemployment insurance program.
The $600-per-week payments, which began at the end of March, would be extended until jobless rates in individual states fell below 11%.

The proposal comes as 33 million people in the United States are either receiving unemployment benefits or awaiting approval, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said.

Israel's government already approved aid of 100 billion shekels ($29 billion), but only about half has been allocated -- prompting a protest by thousands on Saturday night in Tel Aviv against what they said has been an inept government response to the economic crisis.
Unemployment soared to 27% after the country's partial lockdown in March but is now running at 21% as people have come back from furlough.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week announced a new package for Israelis who have lost livelihoods due to the coronavirus crisis, saying the measures would provide an economic safety net for the coming year.
Yaron said the fiscal cost would be 15 billion shekels in 2020 and 27 billion in 2021. That, he said, would bring the budget deficit to about 13% of gross domestic product this year and to 7% next year. Before the second stimulus package, the budget deficit was estimated at 11% of GDP, up from 3.7% in 2019.
The debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to 76% in 2020 and to 78% in 2021, from about 60% last year.
""This is the time to take advantage of the safety cushions we have to alleviate the impact of the crisis and allow the economy and public to get through it with minimal harm,"" Yaron said at Sunday's cabinet meeting.
He said the government has the ability to fund the programme.

The Bank of Israel, which held its benchmark interest rate at 0.1% last week while expanding its bond purchases to include corporate bonds, projects an economic contraction of 6% this year.

The outbreak at meatpacker Toennies' slaughterhouse in the western town of Guetersloh in June infected 1,500 workers, resulting in 600,000 people in the surrounding areas having to go into lockdown for two weeks. 
It also prompted a national debate about conditions in which workers, many of them foreigners, are working in Germany's meat industry.
On Friday, the privately owned company, which has 16,500 employees and some 7 billion euros in annual revenues, requested financial support from the government to pay workers who have been quarantined without falling sick, the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper reported.
""I don't have much sympathy with this,"" Agriculture Minister Julia Kloeckner told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. ""After an entire region was forced into lockdown, this will not help to lessen the public's irritation.""
Germany's long-standing law on preventing infectious diseases allows for firms to receive support if their workers are quarantined.
That sentiment was echoed by Karl-Josef Laumann, labour minister in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where the slaughterhouse was based. Laumann said that while Toennies might have legal grounds to make the request for financial support, the company should be cautious.
""If I were in the position of Mr Toennies and his business partners, I would think very hard about how much more we expect the people of North Rhine West-Phalia to put up with,"" he told the newspaper.

Toennies did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.

According to a decree published on the gazette, signed by President Tayyip Erdogan, the phrase ""worked for at least ten years in relation to their professions"" in the central bank law, was removed.
The provision, which envisages 20% of the bank's annual profit to be reserved as a reserve fund, has been repealed, the same decree said.
""The accumulated reserve funds can be distributed annually by participating in the profit, except for the reserve fund set aside from the last year's profit,"" the decree said.
In May, the bank announced it had an annual net profit of 44.73 billion lira ($6.52 billion) in 2019.
Last month, Vakifbank, Turkey's fourth-largest lender, provoked a social media storm after it appointed a former Olympic wrestling star to its board.

Investing.com - Stocks on Wall Street notched their second weekly gain in a row as the economy continues to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic.
 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1% for the week while the S&P 500 jumped 1.8% in the same time period.
 


 
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, climbed 4% on the week to end at another record high, boosted by gains in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
 


 
Stocks have rallied sharply in recent months, with all three benchmarks up more than 40% from their lows set on March 23 - when coronavirus-related lockdowns shocked the stock market - as a barrage of stimulus from the Federal Reserve stoked risk appetite.
 


 
The U.S. central bank slashed interest rates to zero and rolled out around $2 trillion in stimulus to support the economy in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.
 
However, many market experts have warned the rally could be tested with the start of the second-quarter earnings season on Wall Street next week.
 
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) report their results on Tuesday, followed by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Wednesday.
 
Thursday will see Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) report their results, with Netflix then due after the closing bell.

The funding includes 470 million pounds to build port and inland infrastructure, including in the south-east of England to serve major freight crossings to France.
""There will be specific pieces of infrastructure that we put in place in order to smooth the flow of traffic,"" Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr.
Britain, which is still in talks with the European Union about a post-Brexit trade deal, said it would shortly set out in detail how the British-EU border would operate.
Gove's cabinet colleague International Trade Secretary Liz Truss, in a leaked letter published by Business Insider, voiced concerns about legal challenges to the border proposals and the risk that ports will not be ready in time. 
Asked whether Britain's borders would be ready and secure by the end of the year, Gove said he thought they would be.
""I am absolutely certain that everything that we do is compliant with the law, indeed is designed to ensure that we can not just comply with the law and keep people safe, but also facilitate trade as well,"" he said.
Gove said there had been ""movement"" in the negotiations between Britain and the EU about a post-transition trade deal.
""There are hopeful signs, but I wouldn't want to be over-enthusiastic,"" he said.
The border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and EU member Ireland will be subject to specific guidance.

""We will be saying more about how we are going to implement the Northern Ireland protocol later this month,"" Gove said.

Sunak will open the bidding for towns, cities and regions to become freeports, which would place them outside UK customs territory, in his autumn budget later this year, the newspaper said, citing a copy of the plans it said it had seen. Sunak plans to confirm the successful bids by next spring and introduce major tax and regulatory changes in those areas at next year’s budget, the Telegraph added.
They include research and development tax credits, generous capital allowances, cuts to stamp duty house-purchase tax and business rates, and local relaxations of planning laws.
The successful bidders designated as freeports will ultimately be legally outside UK customs territory, with goods imported, manufactured or re-exported without incurring national tariffs or import VAT until they enter the rest of the economy.
The paper said the government believes the policy can transform ports into international hubs for manufacturing and innovation, with the economic and regulatory incentives designed to encourage firms to establish new factories and processing sites in the areas.

In a second wave of measures, customs duties, import VAT and national insurance contributions would be cut from April 2022, the paper said, making the freeports fully operational within 18 months of Britain's departure from the EU customs union and single market.

He is also in dialogue with the European Union's trade commissioner for a deal that could start with a preferential trade agreement. He added that the ultimate goal here too would be to have a free trade agreement.
""We're talking to the EU and I am in dialogue with the EU trade commissioner. I am looking for an early harvest deal. Open to discussions on a variety of subjects. It’s up to the UK and EU whoever picks up the gauntlet first,"" Goyal said.
Negotiations for a comprehensive free trade agreement between the EU and India were suspended in 2013 after six years of talks.
India pulled out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership last year due to fears over China's access to its markets and is looking for new ways to boost its exports.
The country has also been raising trade barriers to block cheap imports from China and replace them with locally made goods for domestic consumption and exports. 
""Apart from pharmaceuticals, we have textiles, handicrafts, leather, furniture, industrial machinery, toys are areas where India can engage with UK & EU at competitive prices,"" Goyal said.
India's economic growth has largely been driven by local consumption and successive governments have struggled to expand exports.

In the last six years Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been trying to push exports through various programmes like ""Make in India"" but with limited success.

China's Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said in a statement that profit growth would slow sharply at some banks while others could see profits decline.
If banks were to make the minimum amount of provisions for their non-performing loans, which some have yet to do, profits for the sector would fall by more than 350 billion yuan ($50 billion), the statement said.
Data from the commission shows that Chinese commercial banks booked 2 trillion yuan in profits in 2019, up 8.9% from a year earlier.
Outstanding non-performing loans in the sector totalled 3.6 trillion yuan as of end-June, while the bad loan ratio rose to 2.10%, 0.08 percentage points higher than the beginning of the year, the statement said.
Small firms have been allowed to delay loan and interest payments and the central government has called on the country’s financial institutions to sacrifice 1.5 trillion yuan in profits this year to help counter the economic impact of the virus on companies. 
Beijing has also allowed local governments to use the proceeds of special bonds to replenish the capital of certain small banks.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The medium-term outlook for the Indian economy remains uncertain with supply chains and demand yet to be restored fully while the trajectory of the coronavirus spread and the length of its impact remain unknown, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Saturday.
According to most estimates, the Indian economy will register a record contraction of over 4.5% in the current fiscal year that started on April 1 due to the pandemic.
Starting late March, the country was placed under one of the strictest lockdowns in the world for over two months. Since early June, the government has started easing restrictions to help some revival in the economy even though the number of infections in the country continues to rise.
""The Indian economy has started showing signs of getting back to normalcy in response to the staggered easing of restrictions,"" Das said in an address to an online forum.
""It is, however, still uncertain when supply chains will be restored fully. How long will it take for demand conditions to normalise and what kind of durable effects will the pandemic leave behind on our potential growth?"" he said.
Das said that the 2008 global crisis and the current crisis show that such economic shocks have ""fatter tails"" than generally believed, and that the country's financial system should have larger capital buffers.
A recapitalisation plan for Indian banks is necessary as the economic impact of the pandemic may result in higher bad loans and erosion of capital for banks, the RBI governor added.
The central bank has cut policy rates by 115 basis points in response to the pandemic, resulting in a total policy rate reduction of 250 basis points since February 2019, along with providing liquidity of 9.57 trillion rupees ($127.28 billion). 
It has also eased some bad loan provisioning norms and allowed loan moratoriums for retail customers.
Das said that the central bank has to carefully unwind the unusual monetary and regulatory measures taken to cushion the economic shocks in the post pandemic world, as the financial sector should return to normal functioning without relying on the regulatory relaxations as the new norm.
India recorded 27,114 coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, taking the total to 820,915 including 22,123 dead.
The RBI governor also said that inflation will continue to moderate going forward and investment activity will revive.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Friday announced additional duties of 25% on French cosmetics, handbags and other imports valued at $1.3 billion in response to France's digital services tax, but would hold off on implementing the move for up to 180 days.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office said delaying the start of the tariffs would allow further time to resolve the issue, including through discussions in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The decision also reflected France's agreement to defer collection of its 3% tax on digital services.
The U.S. move follows a U.S. Section 301 probe, which concluded the French tax discriminates against U.S. tech firms such as Google (O:GOOG), Facebook (O:FB) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
France and other countries view digital service taxes as a way to raise revenue from the local operations of big tech companies which they say profit enormously from local markets while making only limited contributions to public coffers.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer first disclosed on Thursday plans to impose new tariffs on French goods with deferred implementation. The $1.3 billion worth of goods is part of a list first published by USTR in December.
The United States has initiated similar Section 301 investigations of digital services taxes adopted or being considered by 10 other countries, including Britain, India and Turkey, which could result in tariffs against their goods.
OECD talks aimed at developing a multilateral solution for taxing digital services have failed to produce any results, with negotiations complicated by the coronavirus pandemic.
Last month, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin caught European countries by surprise when he suggested a pause in the OECD talks given the lack of progress there.

A spokesman for the European Union told Reuters earlier that Brussels could propose its own solution if the OECD talks failed to produce an agreement. He urged Washington to resume the talks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Institute for International Finance on Friday released a legal tool aimed at helping some of the world's poorest countries take advantage of a suspension of debt payments offered by the Group of 20 major economies.
The IIF, which groups more than 450 banks and other global financial institutions, said it developed the template waiver letter https://www.iif.com/Publications/ID/3993/G20-DSSI-Template-Waiver-Letter-Agreement at the request of U.N. officials and others who are worried the pandemic could spark a major debt crisis.
The G20 countries and the Paris Club of official creditors in April agreed to freeze debt payments from the 73 poorest countries for the rest of 2020 to free up funds to contain the pandemic and mitigate its economic fallout.
Forty-one countries have expressed interest in the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), but the Paris Club has signed agreements with just under half of them so far, including Ivory Coast, Ethiopia and Pakistan.
Some countries have been reluctant to participate out of concern that doing so could trigger an automatic ""event of default"" on their private sector debts, even if the freeze only affects official bilateral debt payments.
Many private sector loans include terms that allow creditors to declare a default if circumstances - such as payments to official creditors - change. Private sector lenders have said they would be willing to waive those clauses on a case-by-case basis, but borrowers would need to request such a step.
The IIF letter will speed up that process by giving borrower countries a legal template they can adapt to ask commercial creditors to waive the possibility of a default, said IIF Managing Director Sonja Gibbs.
""It allows borrowers to ask their official bilateral creditors for this debt service suspension without triggering an event of default,"" she said.

The industry has lobbied the government since 2017 to allow the sale of firearms sound suppressors to individuals in other countries, not just foreign militaries and police.
""Effective immediately, the Department of State has rescinded its April 18, 2002, firearms sound suppressor policy,"" according to the State Department website.
The new guidance followed an interagency review started in 2017 that ""addresses the concerns from U.S. companies they were losing potential sales to foreign manufacturers of firearms sound suppressors,"" a department spokesman said in an email.
Silencers will now be able to be licensed and exported like any other weapon on the U.S. munitions list which includes satellites and nuclear weapons.
The State Department said all silencer export licenses would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

(Reuters) - New Jersey, one of the states hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak, would borrow up to $9.9 billion from sources that could include the U.S. Federal Reserve to deal with massive revenue losses from the economic shutdown, under an agreement announced on Friday between the governor and legislative leaders.
At a media briefing, Democratic Governor Phil Murphy said the state ""is out of money"" and that it needs the borrowing as well as an influx of federal dollars due to a budget shortfall through 2021 that he cautioned could reach $20 billion.
""Everybody recognizes the need for the borrowing, as painful as it is,"" he said. ""We know we don't have a choice even with federal cash.""
The Fed's municipal liquidity facility is an option for a significant portion of the borrowing, according to Murphy's office. Illinois became the first state to tap the program with a $1.2 billion, one-year loan last month.
New Jersey Senate President Steve Sweeney, a Democrat, said the borrowing would address the financial crisis caused by the virus and would be overseen by a new legislative commission. A borrowing bill is expected to be taken up by the Senate next week and then move to the Assembly for a vote.
States, including New Jersey, have been pushing the U.S. Congress for unrestricted funding they could use to plug big budget holes caused by plummeting tax revenue. 
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday called for $1 trillion for state and local governments
To deal with its crisis, New Jersey extended the end date for its fiscal 2020 budget by three months to Sept. 30, 2020. Fitch Ratings in April downgraded New Jersey's credit rating one notch to A-minus with a negative outlook, citing ""significantly weakened finances.""

New Jersey has had 176,575 cases of the coronavirus, according to a Reuters tally, the fifth-highest of any U.S. state. https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-USA/0100B5K8423/index.html

374,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 04:27PM ET</span>",Senate Banking Panel to Vote on Stalled Shelton Fed Nomination,"(Bloomberg) -- The Senate Banking Committee is set to vote on President Donald Trump’s two Federal Reserve Board nominees after lawmakers return from a two-week break, an indication they’re ready to move forward on his contentious pick of Judy Shelton.
The committee will vote on the long-stalled nominations of Shelton and Christopher Waller on July 21, according to a scheduling notice. Approval by the panel would send the nominations to the floor for a confirmation vote by the GOP-controlled Senate.
Trump’s nomination of Shelton had been held up since her hearing in February by reservations among some Republican senators on the 25-member panel about her views on monetary policy.
In the past she’s has advocated returning the dollar to the gold standard, and expressed skepticism about the relevance of the Fed’s congressional mandate to pursue maximum employment and stable prices.
The 12 Democratic members of committee, led by ranking member Sherrod Brown, sent a letter to committee Chairman Mike Crapo asking him to hold another hearing on Shelton’s nomination before moving forward with a vote.
“We are now in an economic crisis worse than the one Dr. Shelton was asked about at her confirmation hearing,” the senators wrote. “Based on her answers at the hearing, we are deeply concerned that the situation we are in today would have been worse if Dr. Shelton were already sitting on the Board of Governors.”
Independence Needed
The Democrats said the committee must “make sure that members of the Federal Reserve can take on the challenges of an economic crisis capably and independently, and in a way that protects the workers, businesses, and communities that make our economy run.”
The White House and Shelton had been working to overcome resistance to the nomination among a few Republicans, who hold a slim majority on the panel.
In the weeks after the hearing and shortly before the Covid-19 crisis put the Senate into a prolonged recess, Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama said he wouldn’t stand in the way of the nomination if most of Republicans on the panel support her.
Even so, “she wouldn’t be my number one choice,” Shelby told reporters.
Another Republican on the committee, Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, said that he received a letter from Shelton clearing up his concerns about her past comments indicating she supports the Federal Reserve devaluing the dollar in response to devaluations of other currencies.
A third GOP panel member who’d been undecided, Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, hasn’t publicly said whether he would support or oppose Shelton, who has a Ph.D. in business administration and recently has been an informal adviser to Trump.
With Democrats lined up against Shelton’s nomination, a single Republican “no” vote on the committee would be enough to block it.
Waller, Trump’s other Fed nominee, is a Ph.D. economist and head of research at the St. Louis Federal Reserve. He faced few questions at the committee’s Feb. 13 hearing for the two nominees.

Responding to the announcement, Mexico's Foreign Ministry said the country was committed to defending multilateralism as a policy priority.
""Angel Gurria has announced that he will not seek re-election in the OECD, but Mexico is promoting the candidacy of Dr. Jesus Seade to lead the WTO,"" a spokesman said. ""He has the necessary profile, after the successful negotiation of the USMCA to advance with present and future challenges of the WTO."" 
Seade, who led his government's team to conclude negotiations of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal, is currently in Geneva and likely to present his candidacy to the body next week.
Eight candidates are vying for the top job. With three of the six previous director-generals coming from Europe and the others from Thailand, Brazil and New Zealand, pressure has been building to choose a leader from Africa.

Gurria said on Twitter that he would continue to work until June 2021.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve added $1.33 billion in bonds of individual companies from June 22 to June 30, including iPhone maker Apple Inc (O:AAPL), beer-producer Anheuser-Busch (BR:ABI)and travel booker  Expedia  Group (O:EXPE).
The bond purchases, all on the secondary market, bring the Fed's holdings of individual corporate bonds to $1.59 billion, according to the latest of what will be monthly reports to Congress on the Fed's emergency lending facilities to nurse the economy through the coronavirus pandemic. 
In all, the Fed's portfolio included 330 issuers, led by $26.9 million of  Verizon Communications  (N:VZ) bonds, $26.3 million of AT&T Inc (N:T) bonds, and $25.5 million of Apple bonds. 
Holdings also included $3.2 million of Expedia and $10.1 million of  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), whose debt rating was downgraded to junk after the coronavirus crisis hit.
The Fed also held $7.97 billion in 16 corporate bond exchange traded funds (ETF), the data showed. Roughly half of the corporate bond ETF shares purchased went to funds owned by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), which is managing the Fed's corporate credit facilities. BlackRock waived asset management fees on ETFs purchased on behalf of the Fed.
Other global central banks have bought individual corporate bonds for years, but the program is new for the Fed during this pandemic. The aim is to ensure companies can continue to finance themselves, and not be forced into bankruptcy because they are unable to raise needed cash. 
The program is backed by investment capital from the U.S. Treasury to absorb any losses from defaults.
The Fed has reduced the pace of corporate bond purchases made in the secondary market from about $300 million daily to slightly less than $200 million a day, and it could stop the purchases entirely if market conditions keep improving, Daleep Singh, executive vice president of the New York Federal Reserve said this week.

Latin America's second-largest economy had posted a higher-than-expected inflation rate for June and the Mexican central bank, known as Banxico, did not rule out further rate cuts.
""But we believe further cuts will be data dependent, in particular to developments in inflation and the foreign exchange,"" according to the Bank of America research note dated Thursday. 
With the U.S. presidential election in the second half of 2020, fiscal concerns in Mexico and the coronavirus still spreading, Bank of America said Banxico's key overnight lending rate should stay at around 5% for the remainder of the year due in part to core inflation remaining above the central bank's 3% target.
Mexico's national statistics agency INEGI said the annual inflation rate picked up in June to 3.33% from May's 2.84%. It compares with a rate of 3.95% from the same month a year earlier.
A Reuters poll of analysts had forecast annual inflation at 3.20%.

Banxico cut its benchmark interest rate to 5.00% on June 25, the lowest level in nearly four years, citing worries about growth and an uncertain outlook due to fallout from the pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, seeking to force school districts and universities to reopen despite the coronavirus, on Friday said the U.S. Treasury Department would re-examine their tax-exempt status and funding.
Trump already has threatened to cut their federal funding and sought to eject university students from abroad.
""Too many Universities and School Systems are about Radical Left Indoctrination, not Education,"" the Republican Trump wrote in a tweet on Friday likely to sit well with his conservative base. 
He accuses Democrats of exploiting the pandemic for political purposes by refusing to reopen schools and businesses, even as health experts caution against the perils of easing restrictions too quickly. 
""Therefore, I am telling the Treasury Department to re-examine their Tax-Exempt Status and/or Funding, which will be taken away if this Propaganda or Act Against Public Policy continues. Our children must be Educated, not Indoctrinated!"" 
Trump's administration is pushing schools to relaunch in-person classes even as cases of the novel coronavirus surge in some of the country's most populous areas, prompting some to roll back their plans to relax restrictions.
School administrators are weighing the risk to opening up their buildings to primary and secondary students and staff as U.S. cases have topped 3 million this week. Some universities have announced online-only instruction plans, while others weigh options such as school calendar changes. 
Trump this week threatened to cut off federal funds for schools that do not open their doors.

Southern European bonds and the euro have rallied hard in the two months since France and Germany mooted a 750 billion-euro ($848 billion) post-COVID-19 recovery fund. On July 17-18, European leaders meet to hammer out details. But differences remain on whether the fund should be based on loans or grants; if the proposal stumbles, markets will take it badly.
Even a watered-down deal would be significant as it will allow the bloc to move towards mutualising debts. It could mark Europe's ""Hamilton moment"" - a reference to the first U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton who in the 1790s engineered a deal allowing the federal government to assume the debts of individual states, selling Treasury bonds to fund them.
The European Central Bank, meanwhile, meets on Thursday. Decisive EU action to revive the economy would ease pressure on the bank to deliver more stimulus. It might then consider buying more supranational debt for its asset-purchase scheme, as a recovery fund would help make the EU the region's biggest supranational issuer.

2/A HEALTHY BULL?
A recent editorial in the official China Securities Journal calling for a healthy bull market fuelled an equity buying rush, lifting stocks 14% already in July. 
But open some more newspapers and the state-sponsored editorial begins to take on the air of a distraction. Factory-gate prices are falling and payrolls were cut for the sixth straight month, a private business survey shows.
Then there's politics. Western pushback against Hong Kong's new security law is gaining momentum, with Washington imposing sanctions on several Chinese officials. Canada and Australia have suspended extradition treaties and Britain opened a citizenship pathway for Hong Kongers. India has banned dozens of Chinese social media apps after border clashes.
Beijing's response has been bluster - but investors should be wary. It may not be just the yuan and Chinese shares building up a head of steam.

America Inc. kicks off its second-quarter earnings season from Tuesday and Refinitiv data predicts a 44.1% slump - the biggest since the 2008-9 crisis.
Coronavirus-linked shutdowns will have wiped out profits especially in the energy, consumer discretionary and industrials sectors. Back in January when the pandemic was yet to make headlines, Q2 earnings were seen growing 7.2%. 
There may be silver linings. Recent equity rallies imply investors are disregarding Q2 reports and focusing on the outlook. And a ""substantial earnings beat"" is likely, say BofA analysts, citing economic data improvements in May and June. More importantly for markets, companies will offer ""very positive forward guidance"", BofA predicts.

4/OPEC CHECK 
With the world economy seemingly past its worst and energy demand slowly recovering, OPEC and its ally Russia are expected on July 15 to whittle down the 9.7 million barrels-per-day production cut made in June to protect crude prices from collapse. Effective August, the cut will then stand at 7.7 million bpd. 
The question now is to what degree the relentlessly rising U.S. coronavirus count hampers economic recovery. The news isn't good elsewhere either; India's June fuel demand, for instance, fell 7.9% versus year-ago levels. 
OPEC moves to release more crude onto markets will come amid renewed oversupply fears. Oil market risks are ""almost certainly to the downside"" the International Energy Agency warns.

5/ RISE AND SHINE 
Up 19% this year, gold has had a stellar run, recently cracking the $1,800 per-ounce level to scale nine-year peaks. 
Several factors have driven the precious metal's ascent, especially the safe-haven bid as the coronavirus wreaked havoc. As economies re-opened from May, retail buying helped accelerate the rally. Now focus is on gold as an inflation hedge.
With central banks and governments in full stimulus mode, inflation will be roused from its decade-long slumber, economists expect, though that's a long-term rather than immediate possibility.
Between coronavirus risks and inflation expectations, speculators are taking no chances; positioning data indicates a market very long on gold. Prices will hit $2,000 within a year, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) predicts.

383,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 09:54AM ET</span>","Fed’s Kaplan Says Mask Use Would Spur Growth, Curb Joblessness","(Bloomberg) -- Wide-spread mask wearing and following other health-care measures will be key to economic growth in the U.S., said Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan.
“While monetary and fiscal policy have a key role to play, the primary economic policy from here is broad mask wearing and good execution of these health-care protocols,” Kaplan said Friday in a Fox Business interview. “If we do that well, we’ll grow faster.”
Kaplan said mask wearing could substantially mute the spread of the coronavirus, which is resurging in parts of the country and leading to a renewed halt in economic activity. Using face coverings would likely bolster reopenings and create faster growth and a lower unemployment rate.
“If we all wore a mask it would substantially mute the transmission of this disease and we would grow faster. We would have a lower unemployment rate,” he said. “We’d grow faster, and would be far less likely to slow some of our reopenings. But we’ve been uneven so far on mask wearing.”
Kaplan said he expects the U.S. economy to grow in the third and fourth quarters, but that the year overall will see a contraction of 4.5% to 5%.
He added that the economy will likely need more fiscal stimulus. Unemployment benefits will need to be continued in some form, in addition to more aid to state and local governments. The $600 additional weekly jobless benefit passed under the CARES Act in March is set to expire at the end of this month, while some 18 million people are still receiving unemployment insurance.

""How the virus proceeds, and what the incidence is, is going to be directly related to how fast we grow,"" Kaplan told Fox Business Network in an interview. ""While monetary and fiscal policy have a key role to play, the primary economic policy from here is broad mask wearing and good execution of these health care protocols; if we do that well, we'll grow faster."" 
A recent surge in COVID-19 cases in several U.S. states including Texas is raising concern that a recovery that likely began in May could falter if authorities re-impose lockdowns or consumers reduce spending out of fear that getting out and about could mean they get the sometimes fatal disease.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) economists have argued that a national mask mandate would boost the chances of a faster recovery. Governors in some states have imposed local mandates, though in some hotspots like Florida mask-wearing is voluntary. 
Kaplan, who spent part of his career as a Goldman Sachs banker, reiterated his view that the U.S. economy will likely shrink by 4.5% to 5% in 2020, even after what he expects to be growth during the third and fourth quarters. And he said he was not surprised by the unexpected decline last month in U.S. producer prices, given high unemployment and unused productive capacity.
""I would expect we are going to have disinflation for some period of time until we get rid of this excess capacity,"" Kaplan said. 

""The message I'd have today about the economy (is that) while monetary policy and fiscal policy are very important, they are not as important right now in us doing a good job of flattening this curve on the virus, and if we do that, we'll grow faster.""

385,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 08:36AM ET</span>",What Google Data Tells Us About India’s Economic Recovery,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s economy is struggling to overcome the adverse hit from the world’s biggest lockdown, a series of high-frequency indicators show.
From power consumption to jobs to Google’s mobility trends, the figures show activity has picked up from the record slump registered in April, but the recovery has a long way to go.
In the absence of official figures, economists are increasingly turning to alternative data sets to get a better sense of how Asia’s third-largest economy is coping with the coronavirus pandemic. The strict stay-at-home measures have almost paralyzed official data collection, with the government failing to publish headline consumer price figures for April and May. The last report on factory output data was for March, with the statistics office suspending field surveys because of the lockdown.
On Friday, the government published industrial output data for May that showed a “graded pickup” in activity from April, but it cautioned against comparing the index with months preceding the Covid-19 outbreak. Even though India has eased some of the pandemic restrictions, curbs on movement in so-called containment zones mean the statistics surveys haven’t yet resumed everywhere.
Here’s a look at some of the key high-frequency indicators being tracked and what they say about the economy.
Stringency Index
The Oxford Stringency Index for India collects publicly available information on 17 indicators of government responses to the pandemic. Eight of the indicators record information on containment and closure policies, such as school closures and restrictions in movement.
Four of the indicators record economic policies, such as income support to citizens or provision of foreign aid, and five indicators record health system policies such as the virus testing regime or emergency investments into health care.
After declining slightly at the beginning of June, the index has been relatively flat around 76 for most of the month. Bloomberg Economics’ Abhishek Gupta sees only a marginal easing in the index going forward given the latest incremental relaxation of restrictions.
Power Consumption
Electricity consumption is a widely used proxy to gauge demand in India’s industrial and manufacturing sectors. The figures show a sharp slump in demand for power after the lockdown was imposed, and a slow comeback since then.
According to the index, derived from data from India’s Ministry of Power, demand flattened during the week ended June 28, and was down 7.4% from a year earlier, marginally higher than the 7.3% drop in the prior week, according to Bloomberg Economics.
Jobless Rate
Many economists have started tracking the weekly unemployment data from the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy for early indications on how the job market is faring. In the immediate aftermath of the lockdown, the CMIE estimated a ‘mind-boggling’ 122 million jobs were lost in the economy and the unemployment rate hit more than 27%.
After declining steadily since then, the latest data shows the unemployment rate ticked up to 8.9% in the week ended July 5 from 8.6% in the week prior.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Mobility
This tracker is turning out to be a favorite for many economists. Anal Ghosh, senior program manager at Google India, told Bloomberg Quint the report is aimed at researchers to help them understand human mobility for predicting epidemics, urban and infrastructure planning, and understanding peoples’ response to conflict and natural disasters.
The latest data shows that as the lockdown has lifted, the improvement in workplace mobility has been uneven. While there’s been a pickup since April, the average was still 30.4% below the baseline in the first half of June, according to Garima Kapoor, an economist at Elara Securities Pvt Ltd.
Retail Spending
The number of consumers visiting retail stores surged in June from the previous month as retailers slowly began reopening, according to data from ShopperTrak. But compared with a year earlier, footfalls are still down more than 90%, according to the data. ShopperTrak’s index is based on inputs from collection devices in the retail marketplace and shopper visits.
Loan-Deposit Ratio
Bank deposit growth outpaced that of loans in both April and May, in a clear indication that investment activity has taken a back seat. That trend extended into June, according to data from the central bank. So for every 100 rupees in deposits, banks have 74 rupees in loans, down from 76.4 in March.
“The sharp fall in the loan-to-deposit ratio may reflect both a fall in credit demand and banks’ risk aversion to lend percolating from the large Covid-19 shock,” economists at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Co. said in a recent note.

(Reuters) - European Council President Charles Michel on Friday sought to offer concessions to countries across the EU in plans for the EU's long-term budget and economic recovery, hoping to bridge differences between national leaders when they meet next week.
Michel, who will chair the first face-to-face meeting of European Union leaders since coronavirus lockdowns were lifted, proposed a smaller 2021-27 budget in a bid to make a mass economic stimulus more palatable to thrifty northern countries.
He proposed a long-term EU budget of 1.074 trillion euros - down from the European Commission's suggested 1.094 trillion - and a recovery fund of 750 billion euros for pandemic-hammered economies, with two-thirds in grants and a third in loans.
""The COVID-19 crisis presents Europe with a challenge of historic proportions,"" Michel said in a statement. ""We are slowly exiting the acute health crisis. While utmost vigilance is still required on the sanitary situation, the emphasis is now shifting to mitigating the socio-economic damage.""
The COVID-19 pandemic is the latest big challenge for the 27-nation EU after it struggled with a debt crisis a decade ago, chaotic mass migration, and then the trauma of Brexit. 
Some leaders have even framed it as existential for the bloc, saying it cannot be seen to fail this time as eurosceptic feeling mounts in countries such as Italy.
Michel proposed maintaining the so-called rebates that wealthier countries receive on their budget contributions and, in a couched reference to Poland, Hungary and others, said funding would be conditional on respect for the rule of law.
An EU diplomat from one of the larger member state called the plan ""a good basis"" for further negotiations ahead of the summit but cautioned ""not everyone will agree on everything"".

Michel proposed allocating a share of the recovery funds on the basis of economic declines, which means debt-burdened countries in the south like Italy and Greece will stand to benefit because they have been hit hardest by the pandemic. 
The proposal for the seven-year budget is known in Brussels jargon as the ""negotiating box"", a complex set of numbers covering spending on areas from support for agriculture to regional development, research and scholarships.
This is the starting point for negotiations between the 27 national leaders when they meet on July 17-18.
EU summits that involve money are always the most fraught, and sometimes haggling goes into an extra day or two, which is why leaders often pack for a ""four-shirt"" trip to Brussels.
Although setting the budget - called the multiannual financial framework (MFF) - is an arcane process, the stakes are high because such huge sums are involved. 
This time, the negotiations are even more critical and complicated because the leaders will also try to agree on the recovery fund, and member states are trying to trade concessions in one against benefits in the other.
In a signal that there is a long road ahead before agreement on the EU budget, which will have to be ratified by the European Parliament, a leader of the conservatives group in the EU assembly served warning that Michel's proposal fell too short.

Siegfried Muresan said in a tweet that parliament could not accept an overall budget below the European Commission's proposal, adding: ""A smaller MFF will jeopardise EU support to our researchers & students. It will prevent us from tackling climate change or improving citizen's security.""

388,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 06:47AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday, July 10th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- China’s markets pause for breath as the U.S. steps up sanctions against its officials, but new economic data point to an ongoing recovery. The U.S. registers another record high for new cases of Covid-19 and the IEA warns that the situation could hit oil demand for the rest of the year. Industry rebounded sharply in France and Italy as lockdowns lifted. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, July 10th.
1. Chinese markets ease off
China’s stock frenzy eased off as state banks reportedly cut their purchases, sending a signal that was dutifully followed by the army of retail traders that has piled in to the market in recent days.
The Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 stock index fell 1.8% but has still gained more than 14% in the first 10 days of this month.  That’s come against the background of an economic recovery that is building momentum (new loans rose to their highest in three months in June), but also in the context of increasingly clear antagonism between China and the West.
The U.S. sanctioned the top regional official in the western province of Xinjiang on Thursday, and also approved an expensive upgrade to Taiwan’s air defenses. 
The yuan edged back to 7.01 to the dollar.
2. U.S. virus cases hit another new record; deaths rise
The U.S. posted a record 63,000 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday according to Johns Hopkins data.
Texas, California and Florida all recorded new record highs for deaths, while Arizona posted its highest number of new infections in six days. Harris County, which includes Houston, and Miami-Dade both reported increasing use of intensive care facilities.
The state of Nevada reimposed restrictions on indoor dining and bars, while Kentucky joined the list of states requiring masks to be worn in public spaces.
Further afield, Hong Kong closed its schools in response to a cluster of new cases discovered in recent days, while Australia’s second city Melbourne remains under quarantine.
3 Stocks set to open lower
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower again as the spread of the coronavirus across much of the south and west casts further doubt on the economy’s ability to sustain its rebound.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow 30 futures contract was down 114 points, or 0.5%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 0.4% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 0.2%.
Stocks in focus later may include HP (NYSE:HPQ), the world’s biggest maker of PCs, after data showing a surge in PC sales in the second quarter as people geared up for more working from home. BioNtech (NASDAQ:BNTX) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) may also see some interest after the former’s CEO told The Wall Street Journal that their experimental drug for treating Covid-19 may be available by December.
In Europe, stocks were on course to end the week lower as updates from brewer Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) and duty-free shop operator Dufry (OTC:DUFRY) signalled a hard slog ahead.
4. France, Italy factory output rebounds sharply
The economic rebound in Europe looked a little more secure after both France and Italy posted big rebounds in industrial production in May.
French output rose 19.6% in the month, while Italy – which had experienced a sharper drop because of the intensity of the epidemic in its most industrialized provinces – registered a 42.1% rebound.
The numbers were both well ahead of expectations and compensate somewhat for surprisingly weak data out of Germany earlier this week.
Elsewhere, the EU’s Council President Charles Michel proposed a compromise to break the deadlock in negotiations on the proposed 750 billion-euro recovery fund, which will increase the amount of transfers between states to unprecedented levels.
The euro rose 0.1% to $1.1297.
5. IEA warns on oil demand
Crude oil prices fell to their lowest in nearly two weeks after the International Energy Agency warned of risks to its demand forecasts from the spread of the coronavirus in its latest monthly report.
“The large, and in some countries, accelerating number of COVID-19 cases is a disturbing reminder that the pandemic is not under control and the risk to our market outlook is almost certainly to the downside,” the IEA said.
The Paris-based agency nonetheless revised its forecast for average oil demand upward by 400,000 barrels a day to 92.1 million b/d, to reflect the fact that consumption had fallen by less than it previously estimated in the second quarter.
By 6:40, U.S. crude futures were down 2.0% at $38.81 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent was down 1.8% at $41.59 a barrel."

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors poured the most cash into China funds since July 2015, BofA said on Friday, even as fears grew of a repeat of the 2015-16 bubble that saw the benchmark Shanghai index fall more than 40% from its peak in just a few weeks.
This week's $6.1 billion directed into China funds was the second largest ever, BofA added, citing data from EPFR global.
Chinese funds also led equity inflows, receiving inflows equal to 2.5% of assets under management, compared to just 0.1% globally, the bank said. 
Shares in the blue-chip CSI300 index have risen to levels not seen since the 2015 bubble, supported by hopes of an economic recovery, a conducive regulatory environment and retail investor enthusiasm. 
Chinese state-run media, previously encouraging the rally, warned on Thursday that investors should respect the market, manage risks and pursue rational investments, after regulators published a list of illegal margin lending platforms in an apparent move to calm markets. 
That paused the stock rally on Friday, the session ending lower for the first time since June 29, after the country's state funds announced stake cuts in companies. 
""It's not the first time we've seen moves of this magnitude and it doesn't typically end well,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA.
""If we continue to see these efforts to encourage participation, I would be surprised if we don't continue to see inflows. People don't like to miss out on rallies like these, which is one of the things that makes them so dangerous."" 
BofA's report also showed weekly flows of $29.4 billion into cash funds, $17.8 billion into bonds funds, $6.2 billion into equities funds and $2.4 billion into gold funds. Emerging markets bonds saw their first inflow in four weeks. 

The bank sees ""cross asset sentiment moving quickly away from 'extreme bearish'"", citing its Bull & Bear indicator, that tracks positioning.

390,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>",Spain's Calvino says one country broke pledge in Eurogroup vote,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish Economy Minister Nadia Calvino said on Friday that one euro zone country had broken its pledge to support her in her bid to become Eurogroup chief, seen by some at home as a sign of Spain's weakness in the EU.
""We had 10 votes secured. Someone didn't do what he said he was going to do,"" Calvino told radio station SER on Friday. She declined to say who she thinks the person was.
The Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers on Thursday elected Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe as its new chair after a second round in which he defeated Calvino by one vote.
Calvino had secured the support of the euro zone's three largest countries, France, Germany and Italy, and Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez had publicly said he was optimistic that she would get the job.
Sanchez's victory in national and European elections, which gave Spain the biggest Socialist contingent in the European Parliament, had triggered hopes of a bigger Spanish role in the European Union. 
But the right-leaning newspaper El Mundo described Calvino's defeat as ""a failure that weakens Spain"", partly blaming Sanchez for lobbying larger countries at the expense of smaller ones, which carry the same votes.
Ana Beltran, vice secretary of the conservative People's Party, called it ""clear proof of Spain's weakness"".
Spain had already given up on the idea of putting forward Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya as a candidate to lead the World Trade Organisation.
Calvino rejected the criticism, saying that the countries supporting her represented more than 80% of the euro zone population and economies.

Donohoe has in the past opposed government spending increases and deficits. Unlike Spain, Ireland opposes any EU tax on digital firms. ""The vision of Europe that that country has doesn't match the one we have,"" Calvino said.

394,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 04:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Japan may still build Aegis Ashore despite reports of cancellation - source,"By Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan may still build Aegis Ashore missile defense systems to defend against attacks by North Korea and other regional rivals, including China, a source told Reuters just weeks after reports that the proposal had been killed.
Japan's defense minister, Taro Kono, last month cancelled plans to build two Aegis Ashore sites, citing cost and concerns that falling booster stages from the interceptor missiles could drop on local residents.
Japan, however, has not cancelled the $1 billion contract for the defense system's radars, built by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), and is mulling a technical assessment from the U.S. government that makes recommendations on using other sites that would eliminate the safety issues, said the source, who has direct knowledge of the process.
""Japan wants to preserve its contracts and reutilize equipment,"" said the source, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Options include installing missile launchers on sea platforms or in remote coastal locations to eliminate the risk from falling boosters, the source said. Japan also has warships equipped with ballistic missile interceptors.
Any decision to stick with Aegis Ashore could upset both Beijing and Moscow, which have pushed for an end to the deployment. With at least three times the range of older Aegis radars on Japanese warships, the land-based systems can look deep into China and Russia.
In its 2019 defense white paper, Japan for the first time listed China as its main security threat, pointing to burgeoning defense spending, increased military manoeuvres and a growing arsenal of modern weapons, including ballistic missiles. The document also noted a resurgence in Russian activity in the waters and skies around Japan.
Aegis Ashore could be built at two of 28 existing air defense radar stations dotting Japan's coast, according to Gen Nakatani, a former defense minister, who along with other former defense chiefs is in a group reconsidering defense policy in the wake of Kono's surprise decision.
""There is no reason why we couldn't put the radar, the combat system and missile launcher in separate locations. That is something we can consider,"" he said in an interview. 
Nakatani said he welcomed Kono's decision to cancel Aegis Ashore because it was an opportunity to build an integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) system to tackle broader threats. 
Japan picked Aegis Ashore in 2017 after Pyongyang fired 40 missiles over two years, some over Japan, and tested three nuclear bombs, the last of which had an explosive yield of 160 kilotonnes, eight times as powerful as the atom bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
Subsequent North Korean missile advances, however, meant that Japan would have to pay more to upgrade Aegis when it switched on in 2025 so it could counter other threats, such as missiles on depressed trajectories that remain inside the atmosphere.

Japan's National Security Council is considering new defense proposals, including the possibility of acquiring a strike capability to attack enemy missiles launchers, before reaching a conclusion by the end of September.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Samira Hanna spends a lot of time in the dark. Her old Beirut apartment gets less than two hours of electricity a day, and with Lebanon's economy in ruins, the grandmother can barely afford candles, let alone a private generator.
""I sit outside on the stairs for some light,"" she said. ""We don't watch television. I wait for the electricity to come so I can wash clothes ... And there's nothing in the fridge, believe me.""
Exacerbated by Lebanon's financial meltdown, fuel shortages have worsened existing power cuts, piling further hardship on Lebanese struggling with job losses, soaring prices and hunger.
Parts of the capital Beirut now get just a few hours of electricity a day in the summer heat. Some residents said the blackouts were worse than during the 1975-1990 civil war.
The energy minister has cited stockpiling as one of several reasons behind the shortages, with people buying subsidized fuel as a hedge against inflation. 
""Instead of buying gold, people are buying diesel,"" Raymond Ghajar said recently. 
Smuggling across the border to Syria is also a factor.
Supply has also been interrupted by the fallout of a investigation into shipments that were not up to specification. 
Ghajar said ships carrying fuel started arriving this week and promised a gradual return to normal - although across Lebanon, normal has meant daily power cuts of some kind.
Private generator suppliers, who have long filled the supply gap left by patchy state provision, have also been rationing fuel, and many homes can no longer pay exorbitant fees.
Even hospitals have not been spared: the main Beirut public hospital treating coronavirus cases had to close some operating rooms and turn off air conditioning in its hallways, local media reported.
And without energy for switchboards, mobile phone coverage was cut in parts of the country.
Lebanon's power sector, at the heart of the crisis, bleeds up to $2 billion from public funds every year while failing to supply enough electricity. The heavily indebted state has long promised to fix it but has not delivered on its pledge.
Hanna, in her 70s, said she never had it this bad. Daily outages have made her mentally disabled daughter frantic.
The blackouts have stoked resentment towards political leaders who publicly wrangle over how to repair the sector while power cuts get worse.
""It's about time they have pity on us. But what do they care?"" she said. ""They have money and they can live, we can't ... They can see people are suffering, but they can't feel.""
Badiaa, 75, goes without electricity most of the day.

""I wish we had leaders with mercy,"" she said, bursting into tears. ""Everything they say on TV is lies. They're garbage.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Forced to cancel a popular on-site tour due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Bank of Japan created a virtual one that takes viewers through the brick corridors, dome-roofed rooms and even an underground vault of its century-old headquarters online.
With a click of the mouse, visitors to the ""Tour the BOJ from home"" site enter through the central bank's massive courtyard and stroll inside the western, classical-style building with a 360-degree panoramic view of its interiors.
They can also browse a three-dimensional, virtual reality video of the building hunting for hidden ""treasures"" that include an old chair that had been used by the BOJ's governors and the world's first automatic bill inspection machine.
The virtual guide, available for free on the BOJ's website, was created after the central bank was forced to cancel from March a popular tour of its headquarters that attracted 19,000 visitors last fiscal year - of which nearly 10% were overseas travellers.
""What's unique about this online tour is that it's not affected by COVID-19, and that visitors can have the historical building all to themselves,"" said BOJ director Noriaki Kawamura.
Located in Tokyo's Nihonbashi business district, the BOJ's headquarters consist of a new complex, and an old building that was built in 1896 and designated by the government as a cultural heritage.

397,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 02:50AM ET</span>","BOJ to hold fire, stick to cautious optimism on economic outlook","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan (BOJ) is set to keep monetary policy steady next week and offer a cautiously optimistic view on the economic outlook, signaling it has taken enough steps for now to cushion the blow from the coronavirus pandemic, sources told Reuters.
The BOJ may slightly cut its growth forecast for the current year to March 2021, but will stick to its view Japan is headed for a moderate recovery later this year as the pandemic's impact subsides, the sources familiar with its thinking said.
""The economy will remain weak for some time but isn't falling off a cliff,"" one of the sources said. 
""Risks to the outlook are skewed to the downside,"" the source added, a view echoed by two others who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak publicly.
At a two-day rate review ending on July 15, the BOJ is expected to hold off on expanding stimulus and leave unchanged its short- and long-term interest rate targets after having ramped up stimulus in March and April.
The BOJ will release a quarterly report after the meeting.
A recent steady rise in bank lending and stable markets has given the BOJ some breathing space, even as the world's third-largest economy braces for its worst postwar slump.
While exports and consumption remain weak, policymakers hope the increased asset purchases, a new lending facility for cash strapped firms as well as the lifting of lockdown measures in late May will breathe life back into the economy.
In a rare move that underscored the difficulty of predicting the pandemic's impact, the BOJ released its growth and price estimates in a range in April instead of producing a median forecast of the nine board members.
The BOJ may revert to median forecasts in July and may slightly trim this year's growth projection, the sources said.
In its April report, the BOJ projected the economy will shrink by 3.0% to 5.0% this fiscal year.
A Reuters poll shows Japan's economy is forecast to contract 5.3% this fiscal year, the most it has shrunk since comparable data became available in 1994.

On the BOJ's next move, 26 of 40 economists said they expect it to expand its stimulus, with 18 saying it would happen this year and five predicting it would be next year, the poll shows.

398,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>",What's in a name? Banks count cost of loans in NMC collapse,"By Saeed Azhar, Davide Barbuscia and Abhinav Ramnarayan
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - As the crisis engulfing his business empire deepened, Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty met with Bank of Baroda officials in mid-March to discuss the $250 million he and his firms owed.
The loans were granted on the strength of Shetty's reputation as a billionaire and his businesses, in particular, NMC Health, the Middle East-focused hospital group he made his fortune from, according to court filings.
Borrowing on the basis of reputation, known as ""name lending"", and taking on a large exposure to one person or entity is not unusual in the Gulf region despite previous episodes going badly wrong, bankers and analysts told Reuters.
Shetty, an Abu Dhabi-based Indian entrepreneur, was feted as the Gulf's ultimate immigrant success story and NMC Health, the United Arab Emirates' largest private hospital group, borrowed without having to provide collateral from dozens of banks either headquartered or with bases in the region.
NMC's implosion this year amid allegations of fraud and the disclosure of more than $4 billion in hidden debts has left some UAE banks and overseas lenders nursing heavy losses and prompted legal battles to try and recover money owed.
India's Bank of Baroda is suing Shetty for backing away from an agreement it says was decided at the March meeting to give the bank 16 properties as collateral for the debts and to secure additional guarantees. Shetty has said the agreement was a ""fraudulent document"", according to a statement of objection filed to the court on June 16 and seen by Reuters.
Shetty has also argued that the loans were issued in the UAE and cannot be enforced in a court in India, according to the June 16 filing. The bank has said the loans were granted from its local offices in UAE, Oman and Mumbai. 
Bank of Baroda did not respond to a request for comment. A representative for Shetty declined to comment.
The businessman has previously blamed a small group of current and former executives of his companies for NMC's failure, alleging that they used forged documents to borrow on his behalf.
In the June 16 filing, Shetty’s lawyers said he had submitted a complaint to the Federal Attorney General in Abu Dhabi that he was a victim of fraud, forgery and money laundering. 
UAE banks have already declared exposure of over $2 billion to NMC, with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) (AD:ADCB) accounting for nearly $1 billion of that.
ADCB has written off more than a quarter of its NMC debts. But given the healthcare group had a long list of creditors and a complex web of off-balance sheet loans, banks could be facing higher eventual losses at a time when the oil-rich region is dealing with lower crude prices and the impact of the coronavirus. 
""The risk right now is that the provisions that the banks have taken may not be enough and they may have to take more,"" said Shabbir Malik, banking analyst at EFG Hermes.
ADCB said in a bourse filing it is working closely with the joint administrators, other creditors, stakeholders and regulators to ensure investigations are exhaustive and to bring to justice those involved in the alleged ""fraudulent behaviour"" at NMC. It did not provide further comment.
NMC was put into administration in April and Alvarez & Marsal, its administrators, said in late May that they were conducting an investigation of its borrowings and suspected fraud across multiple jurisdictions. The administrators declined to comment further.
NAME LENDING
NMC borrowed money without having to provide collateral from around 80 banks, over a third of them lenders headquartered in the Gulf, according to a list of unsecured creditors published by Alvarez & Marsal. 
Shetty's loans from Bank of Baroda were granted from some of its local offices where, according to a source close to the bank, his solvency was never questioned.
Bank of Baroda said it received multiple personal and corporate guarantees in return for the loans, according to a filing by the bank in its case against Shetty. 
In Saudi Arabia, the collapse of two business empires in 2009 - the Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi & Brothers (AHAB) conglomerate and Maan al-Sanea’s Saad Group – were in part the result of name lending practices.
After over a decade, creditors to the two companies are still struggling to secure some $14 billion in court-approved claims.
""The actual issue with NMC would have been relatively hard to predict,"" said Redmond Ramsdale, head of Middle East bank ratings at Fitch Ratings.
Banks in the Gulf region tend to rely more on cash flow to lend to companies instead of collateral partly because insolvency rules are relatively new and untested compared to bankruptcy proceedings in the United Kingdom (UK) or the United States, lawyers and analysts say.
Competition for customers is also fierce, with over 50 banks in the UAE, a country of 9.4 million people.
UAE's central bank, which is in charge of regulating the banking sector, has not publicly commented on the NMC debacle.
It said this week that while the COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges, the country's banks can withstand any scale of shock because they are well capitalised.
UK's Financial Conduct Authority told NMC in late February that it has commenced a formal enforcement investigation against the company, formerly a member of Britain's prestigious FTSE 100 index, while the UK's accounting regulator has opened an investigation into EY's audit of NMC Health.
EY has said it will cooperate with the review and declined further comment.
NMC's financial irregularities came to light when short-seller Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) questioned its financial statement late last year. NMC initially said that Muddy Waters' report was “false and misleading”.
""We thought they understated their debt by at least several hundred million dollars, and that cash balances were overstated. But 4 billion dollars of undisclosed debt, nobody can find a rug big enough to cover that up, and that's why it went the way it went,” said Muddy Waters’ founder Carson Block.

399,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 12:36AM ET</span>",U.S. sanctions highest ranking Chinese official yet over Uighur rights,"By Daphne Psaledakis, Alexandra Alper and Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on the highest ranking Chinese official yet targeted over alleged human rights abuses against the Uighur Muslim minority, a move likely to further ratchet up tensions between Washington and Beijing.
Washington blacklisted Xinjiang region's Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, a member of China's powerful Politburo, and three other officials. The highly anticipated action followed months of Washington's hostility toward Beijing over China's handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak and its tightening grip on Hong Kong.
A senior administration official who briefed reporters after the announcements described Chen as the highest ranking Chinese official ever sanctioned by the United States.
The blacklisting is ""no joke,"" he said. ""Not only in terms of symbolic and reputational affect, but it does have real meaning on a person's ability to move around the world and conduct business.""
The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. But China has denied mistreatment of Uighur Muslims and says the camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.
The sanctions were imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act, which allows the U.S. government to target human rights violators worldwide by freezing any U.S. assets, banning U.S. travel and prohibiting Americans from doing business with them.
Sanctions were also imposed on Zhu Hailun, a former deputy party secretary and current deputy secretary of regional legislative body the Xinjiang's People's Congress; Wang Mingshan, the director and Communist Party secretary of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau; and former party secretary of the bureau Huo Liujun.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington was also barring Chen, Zhu, Wang and their immediate families, as well as other unnamed Chinese Communist Party officials, from traveling to the United States.
The main exile group the World Uyghur Congress welcomed the move and called for the European Union and other countries to follow suit.
U.S. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who sponsored legislation signed by U.S. President Donald Trump in June that calls for sanctions over the repression of Uighurs, told Reuters the move was ""long overdue"" and that more steps were needed.
""For far too long, Chinese officials have not been held accountable for committing atrocities that likely constitute crimes against humanity,"" Rubio said.
The Associated Press reported last month that China was trying to slash birth rates amongst Uighurs with forced birth control. China denounced the report as fabricated.
Despite Trump's hardline public remarks about Beijing, former national security adviser John Bolton alleged in his recent book that Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping should go ahead with building detention camps in Xinjiang and sought Xi's help to win reelection in November.
Trump said in an interview last month he had held off on tougher sanctions on China over Uighur human rights due to concerns such measures would have interfered in trade negotiations with Beijing.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had also raised objections to the Treasury sanctions, especially against a Politburo member, out of concerns they could further damage U.S.-China relations, according to a person familiar with the matter.
""The United States is committed to using the full breadth of its financial powers to hold human rights abusers accountable in Xinjiang and across the world,"" Mnuchin said in a statement. 
Peter Harrell, a former U.S. official and sanctions expert at the Center for a New American Security, said Thursday's move may signal a continued shift by the Trump administration of ""paying more attention to human rights abuses in China ... after several years of relative neglect.""
Chen made his mark swiftly after taking the top post in Xinjiang in 2016, when mass ""anti-terror"" rallies were held in the region's largest cities involving tens of thousands of paramilitary troops and police. He is widely considered the senior official responsible for the security crackdown in Xinjiang.

United Nations experts and activists estimate more than a million Muslims have been detained in camps in the Xinjiang region.

TOKYO (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund Chief Economist Gita Gopinath urged governments to shift to ""equity-like"" support from one focused on loans as the coronavirus pandemic inflicts prolonged damage on companies.
Gopinath said the massive scale of the shock meant more firms will become insolvent as they suffer lower revenues for many months.
Government support in the form of loans would saddle such companies with huge debt, which would serve like a tax that makes it difficult for them to emerge from the crisis, she said.
""Because there's a bigger insolvency issue here, government support would have to shift more towards being equity-like as opposed to debt-like. Otherwise, you would end up with a lot of firms that exit this crisis with a huge amount of debt over-hang,"" she said.
""If the lending takes form more like equity ... then that's less onus on the firms. That will make it easier for firms to recover from the crisis,"" Gopinath said in a webinar co-hosted by the IMF and the University of Tokyo on Friday.
She did not elaborate on how such financing support would work. During its domestic banking crisis in the late 1990s, Japan injected capital into firms via schemes where state-affiliated bodies bought preferred shares issued by these firms.
Gopinath said any recovery of the global economy will be ""highly uneven and highly uncertain,"" urging countries to continue deploying aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to support their economies.
While food price inflation has risen in some countries, overall consumer inflation will likely stay low in most parts of the world because job losses will curb wages, Gopinath said.
""We have more concerns of inflation going too low, rather than inflation going too high,"" she said.

The IMF views the current recession as the worst since the 1930s Great Depression. In its latest projections made in June, it expects 2020 global output to shrink by 4.9%, compared with a 3.0% contraction predicted in April.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy will shrink at the fastest pace in decades in the year through March 2021, forcing the government to compile another stimulus package to cushion the blow from the coronavirus pandemic, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
Many respondents predicted the Bank of Japan's (BOJ's) next policy step would be to expand stimulus, but they do not see the pandemic triggering a banking sector crisis this year.
The world's third-largest economy is forecast to contract 5.3% this fiscal year, a July 3-9 poll of over 30 economists shows, the most it has shrunk since comparable data became available in 1994. 
It will rebound 3.3% next year, according to the poll.
The economy will grow at an annualised 10.0% pace in the current quarter of the calendar year 2020 after having shrunk 23.9% in the second quarter ended June, the poll shows.
""It would take two to three years for economic activity to return to normal levels in Japan as its overseas markets are likely to continue suffering from the spread of the virus,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Research Institute.
Two-thirds of economists polled expect Japan to compile its next stimulus package this year to ease the pain on companies and households. Japan has so far rolled out two packages totalling $2.2 trillion.
Arata Oto, market economist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) Securities Japan, expects the next stimulus package to be worth about 1-2% of the country's gross domestic product.
The package ""would aim at accelerating Japan's recovery ... once there are more signs the pandemic is beginning to subside, or to help further cushion the blow from COVID-19 if the likelihood of a second wave heightens"", he said.
Globally, more than 12 million have been infected by the virus and over half a million people have died. In Japan, more than 21,000 people have been infected and over 900 killed.
Policy support for hard-hit firms should help counter worries about Japan's financial system, over 90% of economists surveyed said.
Asked about BOJ's next move, 26 of 40 economists said they expect it to expand its stimulus, with 18 saying it would happen this year and five predicting it would be next year.
At next week's rate review, the BOJ is expected to roughly maintain its view the economy will gradually recover this year from the virus-led downturn, sources have said, even as fears of a second wave of infections cloud the outlook.
Japan's core consumer prices, which exclude volatile fresh food but includes energy costs, will drop 0.4% this fiscal year and rise 0.3% next fiscal year, the latest poll showed.

In the first quarter the industry, which includes airlines, airports and other aviation companies, lost 38.1 billion yuan, according to data released by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) on Friday. 
China's aviation industry has been recovering faster than most countries emerging from the COVID lockdowns, underpinned by a steady recovery in the domestic travel market after the epidemic was largely brought under control. 
But passenger numbers showed the sector is still way below pre-COVID-19 levels, according to the latest official data. June passenger numbers fell 42.4% from a year earlier to 30.74 million, the CAAC said, although that was better than a 52.6% decline in May.
In the first half this year, total passenger numbers dropped by 45.8% from a year ago. 
To boost cashflows, a few Chinese airlines have recently rolled out discount passes that would allow passengers unlimited domestic travel with few restrictions. China Eastern Airlines (SS:600115) is the first in June to sell ""fly at will"" flight passes for unlimited weekend domestic travel until the end of the year.
The deal was met with great consumer enthusiasm and more airlines followed suit. Hainan Airlines (SS:600221) this month offered consumers flight passes that would enable them to make unlimited trips to or from Hainan island, a popular tropical tourist spot.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday cleared the way for prosecutors to seek longer prison sentences for a founder and supervisory pharmacist of a Massachusetts compounding pharmacy whose tainted drugs sparked a deadly fungal meningitis outbreak in 2012.
The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston upheld the racketeering and fraud convictions of Barry Cadden, New England Compounding Center's ex-president, and Glenn Chin, its former supervisory pharmacist.
But the three-judge panel said a trial judge erred in sentencing Cadden, 53, and Chin, 52, to nine and eight years in prison, respectively, when he declined to apply various federal sentencing guideline enhancements. 
U.S. Circuit Judge David Barron said the judge, among other things, in calculating a sentence wrongly concluded only the hospitals that bought NECC's drugs could count as victims and not the patients who used them.
But the court also ruled the judge did not wrongly undercalculate the victims' financial losses, which posed ""the greatest risk of substantially increasing our client's sentence,"" said Bruce Singal, Cadden's lawyer.
Prosecutors had cited larger losses in seeking 35-year prison terms.
Both men were indicted in 2014 after a fungal meningitis outbreak traced back to mold-tainted steroids that prosecutors say NECC produced in filthy and unsafe conditions and shipped to hospitals and clinics nationally.
The outbreak sickened 793 patients, more than 100 of whom have died, prosecutors said.
Jurors in separate trials in 2017 acquitted Cadden and Chin of second-degree murder charges related to the deaths of 25 patients but convicted them of racketeering and fraud over alleged misrepresentations made to NECC's customers.
Prosecutors argued hospitals would not have bought drugs from Framingham, Massachusetts-based NECC had they known about its quality control issues.

Cadden and Chin also face separate second-degree murder charges in Michigan, which was hit hard by the outbreak.

In a joint statement, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass said they were recommending the annual meetings, set for Oct. 12-18, be held in a ""primarily virtual format."" 
They said they remained flexible about the format of the talks, depending on developments, and would work to accommodate the needs of their members. 
Malpass first disclosed the plans for virtual annual meetings in a letter to the Bank's governors on Monday.
The decision to meet virtually, rather than in person in Washington, was widely expected given rising infections in the United States, and continuing travel restrictions. More than 60,000 new COVID-19 infections were reported across the United States on Wednesday, the greatest single-day tally by any country since the virus emerged late last year in China.
The spring meetings were also held virtually in April.
The institutions' semi-annual meetings usually bring some 10,000 government officials, business people, civil society representatives and journalists from across the globe to a tightly packed, two-block area of downtown Washington that houses their headquarters.

The annual events including meetings of the IMF's 24-member International Monetary Fund and Financial Committee (IMFC) and the Development Committee, which oversees the work of the World Bank, as well as many smaller meetings throughout the week.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve's holdings of bonds and other assets shrank for a fourth straight week, sliding below $7 trillion, and use of one key emergency liquidity measure dropped to zero in the latest sign that financial stresses that erupted early in the coronavirus pandemic have eased.
The Fed's total balance sheet size declined by about $88 billion to $6.97 trillion as of July 8 versus $7.06 trillion a week earlier, data released on Thursday by the central bank showed. 
It was the largest weekly drop in more than 11 years, and the main driver was the balance of outstanding repurchase agreements - or repos - which fell to zero from $61.2 billion a week earlier. It was the first time in 10 months that banks have not tapped the Fed for this key source of short-term funding.
""In a sense, it is the end of an era,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) economists Thomas Simons and Aneta Markowska wrote in a research note emailed Thursday afternoon. 
The Fed began intervening in the repo market in mid-September after a shortfall of bank reserves led to a record surge in short-term borrowing costs. It ramped up that support to unprecedented levels in March after concerns over the rapidly spreading coronavirus disrupted financial markets. 
Take-up of the Fed's repo operations waned over the past few months as markets stabilized and the Fed provided more liquidity through massive purchases of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. 
The central bank also tweaked the repo operations in June to make them slightly more expensive, positioning them as more of a backstop. That appears to be pushing banks to find private counterparties for their repo needs.
As evidence, there were no bids for a fourth straight day at Thursday's overnight repo offering from the Fed. Officials have pledged to keep monitoring financial conditions and offer more support if needed. 
""They want to be seen as supplying more than enough to the system and they're going to err on the side of doing that,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist for Oxford Economics.

409,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 05:35PM ET</span>",Post-lockdown: Canada aims to wean people from aid and get them working again,"By Julie Gordon and Kelsey Johnson
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is preparing to dial back emergency income support for people laid off due to COVID-19 in favor of more traditional unemployment benefits and will shift resources to a wage subsidy program that encourage employers to rehire staff.
The income support, paid to individuals, has done its job and the focus must now shift to getting people back to work by making better uses of the wage subsidy program, which is paid to businesses, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said this week. 
He promoted the shift after saying Canada would post a historic C$343.2 billion ($252.6 billion) deficit this year.
But Morneau's job will be tricky. COVID-19 cases are increasing more slowly, but there is a heightened risk of a second wave as the economy reopens. Furthermore, the shift must ensure that people do not end up worse off than they were during the lockdown phase.
For example, the emergency support had few restrictions and most people were eligible, while traditional unemployment criteria are more stringent.
So far, some 8 million people have received as much as C$2,000 ($1,472) per month in emergency cash, but the program expires at the end of August. 
""It's going to be critical for the economy, one way or the other, that we transition Canadians off the (income support) and onto the wage subsidy,"" said Colin Guldimann, an economist at the Royal Bank of Canada.
Analysts expect Friday's job data to show 700,000 new jobs in June, following nearly 300,000 gains in May. But the unemployment rate is seen at 12%, not far below the May record of 13.7%.
Under the wage subsidy program, the federal government gives qualifying businesses 75% of employees' wages. But critics of the program say the current requirement to have posted a 30% revenue loss is too onerous and may prevent businesses from fully reopening for fear they will lose access to it. 
""They have to build into the system a little bit more flexibility for all employers, so if they're on the program and they have these ups and downs (in revenue), they don't lose access to the program,"" said Hassan Yussuff, Canadian Labor Congress president. 
The changes are coming, and they will make the program more flexible for employers and aim to stimulate hiring even as uncertainty remains due to COVID-19, Morneau said.
The government on Wednesday set aside C$82.3 billion for the wage subsidy program, some C$64 billion more than it has paid out. By contrast, the income support has cost C$53.5 billion so far, and only an additional C$20 billion has been earmarked for this year.

""The original idea of these programs was to minimize the damage,"" said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets. ""The new goal is to promote recovery... For that to happen, the government would like to see people get back to work.""

Opposition leaders are hoping to use some of the funds to provide stipends for doctors and nurses working on the front lines of the coronavirus epidemic.
Delaware based companies BRV Disbursement Co. LLC and BRV Administrator Co. LLC will manage the resources in exchange for $1.25 million, congress said in a statement.
Reuters was unable to obtain comment from the firms, which do not appear to have websites.
Guaido does not control Venezuela's state institutions or armed forces, but his allies control offshore assets including refiner Citgo and some funds that had been held by Maduro's government in U.S. accounts. 
Despite a sweeping set of sanctions enacted in early 2019, Guaido's allies have struggled to obtain access to funds frozen in the United States due in part to the stringent requirements of U.S. authorities. 

Maduro's government has accused Guaido and others of stealing the nation's resources with the help of the Trump administration.

Affordable housing has been one of President Moon Jae-in’s key policy objectives since taking office in May 2017 with a vow to improve the living standards of a wider range of people. Yet a mismatch of supply and demand in popular neighborhoods and widespread investment purchases have seen prices soar in Seoul.
South Korea Urges Officials to Sell Homes as Prices Fuel Anger
Record-low interest rates aimed at supporting the virus-hit economy have also contributed upward pressure on prices. Politicians with multiple homes have further complicated the issue by giving the impression they are benefiting from the circumstances.
The Moon administration has already unleashed a series of measures that have cooled price increases in many parts of the country. The challenge is to come up with further steps that can address the remaining pockets of soaring prices without buckling the wider property market or limiting potential stimulus for a sputtering economy.
South Korea’s overheating property market has been largely confined to Seoul and its surrounding areas, with prices broadly stable in other large cities and declining in some smaller regions over the past three years.
The average apartment price in Seoul surged more than 50% to 925 million won ($774,000) from May 2017 to June 2020. That compares with a gain of 2% in Busan and 15% in Daegu, where prices are only a third of those in the capital.
The government has expressed concern about excess liquidity flowing into the property market. Broad money supply -- known as M2 -- rose by 9.1% in April from a year earlier, the fastest pace since 2015, as the government expanded loans to struggling companies and handed out cash to families to relieve pandemic pain. The money supply has previously displayed a correlation with Seoul house price growth.
The BOK has cut interest rates by 75 basis points since the pandemic struck, delivering a corresponding decline in lending rates. While that’s a sign of effective monetary policy transmission, it’s a concern when property prices are still rising rapidly.
“There’s not much the central bank can do at this stage,” said Kim Jin-myoung, an economist at Hanwha Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. “You can’t raise rates for the sole purpose of reining in property prices when the economy is still in a slump from the coronavirus.”
BOK Governor Lee Ju-yeol has repeatedly pledged to keep monetary policy accommodative until the economy recovers from the virus downturn. Minutes of the latest May interest rate decision showed some board members expressed concerns about housing market instability, while proceeding with a rate cut to help the economy.
Construction investment led South Korea’s economic expansion under the former administration, as interest-rates were cut and property regulations eased to buoy a then-stagnant property market. The trend has reversed in recent years, with tighter rules and a correction from the previous housing oversupply.
President Moon vowed late last year that the government wouldn’t use the property market as a means to boost growth. Yet the pandemic has deteriorated the outlook for the economy, which is now expected by analysts to contract this year for the first time since the late 1990s Asian financial crisis.
“The property curbs are negative for the construction investment outlook,” said An Young-jin, an economist at SK Securities. “But the government is willing to endure that as they place greater urgency on reining in the property market.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Thursday said the world needed either a multilateral system to govern global trade or a series of bilateral agreements, but the two were in conflict with each other.
Speaking in a webcast event hosted by the London-based Chatham House think-tank, Lighthizer said that Europe's proliferation of some 77 bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) was ""one of the biggest challenges to the multilateral trading system.""
He said that to revive the multilateral trading system enshrined in the World Trade Organization, there needed to be a ""reset"" on global tariff rates, an end to making new trade rules through WTO litigation and new ways to effectively deal with China's state-directed economic model and non-tariff barriers such as product and food safety standards.
""The FTAs, in my opinion, we should just get rid of them. We should have a multilateral system or a bunch of bilateral systems,"" Lighthizer said. ""And to be honest, I can go either way. But we can't have people who...profess to multilateralism and then go around basically being the biggest proponents of a bilateral system.""
The United States last week launched a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada and is in the process of negotiating bilateral trade deals with the United Kingdom and Kenya after activating a ""Phase 1"" trade agreement with China in February.
Lighthizer and U.S. President Donald Trump have long argued that bilateral trade deals were better for the United States than multilateral ones, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Trump pulled the United States out of TPP on his third day in office in 2017.
Lighthizer also said that Britain's former trade secretary Liam Fox is ""one of the favorites"" to become the next director general of the World Trade Organization, but said there were other good candidates as well and the Trump administration is still considering which of the seven to support.

""If you say what are we looking for? Number one, we have someone who understands that we have a fundamental need for reform,"" Lighthizer said, adding that the WTO was at ""a turning point"" that could significantly shift its current form. The next WTO chief will also need to understand that China is ""state capitalism,"" he said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is not considering immediate sanctions against China over its treatment of Hong Kong and does not want to escalate a dispute between the two nations, a Canadian government source said on Thursday.
Last week, Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suspended an extradition treaty with Hong Kong, banned the export of sensitive military items and said Canada could boost immigration from the former British colony after Beijing imposed new national security legislation.
Some members of the main opposition Conservative party want Trudeau to impose sanctions on Chinese officials but such a move is off the table for now, said the source.
""There are a lot of options we have at our disposal,"" said the source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.
Asked about sanctions, the source replied: ""Right now it's not necessarily something that is being considered in the immediate term but lots of things can happen.""
Canada-China relations froze in late 2018, when Canadian police detained Huawei Technologies Co's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on a U.S. arrest warrant.
""We're not seeking to escalate any current dispute with China,"" said the source when asked about the Canadian measures on Hong Kong. ""It's not a question of trying to do something deliberately provocative, it's to take a step in response to a step that the Chinese took.""
For the time being Canada is more focused on measures to boost immigration from Hong Kong.
Australia said on Thursday that Hong Kong students, graduates and workers in the country on temporary visas will have the opportunity to stay and work for an extra five years and then apply for permanent residency.

Canadian Immigration Minister Marco Mendocino, asked on Thursday what Canada would do, said Ottawa was exploring options but did not give details.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers on Thursday elected Ireland's Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe as its new chair, a job that will see him try to steer the group's coronavirus-damaged economies out of their worst recession.
Dubbed ""Prudent Paschal"" by some local media, the Dubliner eschewed demands for bigger tax cuts and spending increases to deliver Ireland's first budget surplus in a decade. He is also strongly against a potential EU tax on digital firms.
Donohoe was elected after two rounds of votes in which he defeated Spain's Economy Minister Nadia Calvino and his Luxembourg counterpart Pierre Gramegna.
He will take over from the outgoing president Mario Centeno on July 13 and will serve a two and half year mandate until the end of 2022.
Despite criticism for its opacity, and recently for its perceived irrelevance, the Eurogroup remains a powerful institution which played a key role during the financial crises of the last decade, ultimately helping to avoid the collapse of the common currency.
Donohoe will have to steer the 19-nation euro zone out of its worst ever recession, with the European Commission estimating the bloc's economy will shrink by 8.7% this year before growing by 6.1% in 2021 - should the coronavirus crisis be under control by then. 
He will have to mediate between a southern bloc which supports a permanent watering down of the bloc's fiscal rules and a northern front led by the Netherlands that prefers a quick return to Brussels' checks on national budgets.
Requirements that states keep fiscal deficits below 3% of gross domestic product and reduce high debt have been suspended during the pandemic, in an unprecedented move.
""As President, I will seek to build bridges amongst all members of the Euro Area, and to engage actively with all member states, to ensure that we have a consensus-based approach to the recovery of our economies and our societies,"" Donohoe said in a statement after his election.
He added that fiscal policy in the euro zone should return to normal only after the recovery is well underway.
EU economics commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said he was confident Donohoe will play a crucial role ""at a time of unprecedented challenges"" for the euro zone.
CENTENO FAREWELL
""In times of crisis the appropriate fiscal stance is one supportive of economic activity. We must not rush in pulling back our economy stimulus as this may harm our economy,"" Portugal's Centeno said in his farewell message.
But, maintaining his traditionally balanced approach, he added: ""What is temporary should be treated as temporary"".
Centeno fully saw his role as a mediator, in the footsteps of Luxembourg's Jean-Claude Juncker. 

Juncker held the post from its creation in 1998 until he was replaced in January 2013 by former Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who was seen as less diplomatic.

Minutes published on Thursday from a June 2 meeting of the BoE's UK Money Markets Committee (MMC), which includes major banks, showed unease about a possible repeat of market chaos that struck in March when the COVID-19 pandemic escalated.
""While it was clear that liquidity had now returned... some members were more pessimistic about the potential recovery and noted the potential for stress to return,"" the minutes said.
In March, a frenzied ""dash for cash"" prompted investors who were normally willing to buy safe assets such as British government bonds to swap them for money held with central banks.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey has said there was a risk that Britain's government would have struggled to raise money without the central bank's intervention to calm the market.
Minutes from the BoE's June MMC meeting also hinted at nerves about the end of the government's job-protecting furlough scheme, which is due to shut at the end of October.
""It was noted that this, in conjunction with Brexit and geopolitical risks, could make year-end challenging,"" the minutes said.
The world's sixth-biggest economy shrank by 25% in March and April and could be heading for its biggest fall in 300 years in 2020, with the unemployment rate on course to more than double to about 10%, according to official projections.
Under a new bonus plan announced by finance minister Rishi Sunak on Wednesday, employers will be paid 1,000 pounds ($1,256) after the furlough scheme expires for every worker who returns to their job, provided they are kept on through to the end of January.
The BoE also published minutes from an extraordinary MMC meeting on March 18, around the height of the market tensions, which showed worry about the pressure heaped on banks.
""The banking sector was facing significant balance sheet constraints, in part as a consequence of corporates drawing down on, or expected to draw down on, revolving credit facilities (RCFs),"" the minutes said.

Some MMC members also asked the BoE if had planned to expand its emergency funding scheme for large companies - the Covid Commercial Financing Facility - to include the financial sector.

(Reuters) - U.S. states that have driven a record surge in coronavirus cases may now be slipping backward https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/REOPEN/yxmpjlxewpr in their economic recovery, as cellphone data shows retail visits in a clutch of high case-growth locations falling below the rest of the country.
In Arizona, Texas, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, which had edged ahead of other states during their drive in May to reopen commerce, retail foot traffic has slipped below levels elsewhere, information from data firm Unacast showed.
The data, which covers the period through July 3, is not representative of retail sales. But it does highlight the dilemma many economists and health experts have raised from the earliest days of the outbreak of novel coronavirus: Inattention to health protocols like wearing of masks and social distancing combined with a rush to reopen businesses could lead to worse outcomes for both public health and the economy.
""A mismanaged health crisis across many states means short-term gains will transform into medium-term sluggishness as social distancing relaxation is reversed and virus fear lingers,"" Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in an analysis on Thursday. ""It's now evident that the economy is entering Q3 (third quarter) with much less momentum than previously anticipated.""
Oxford's recovery https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/OXFORDINDEX/xklvyzdwypg index fell for the second time in three weeks on the basis of a surge in COVID-19 cases that is straining hospital capacity in places like Texas as the hot spots of the outbreak rotate from states in the Northeast to those in the South and Southwest that resisted the strictest health measures early on. Several have since begun tightening rules or imposing restrictions they initially rejected.
The result is an economic reopening that appears to be, at best, in limbo, according to an array of high frequency data and broader analyses prepared by economists and the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The drop in the New York Fed's index may be notable because it was driven lower by the components related to retail sales and consumer confidence, NatWest Markets analyst John Roberts wrote on Tuesday.
""It doesn’t seem like a great sign that retail sales and confidence fell in a week ending with a big U.S. holiday ... It does seem likely, however, that the spike in cases and increased lockdown measures in some hot-zone states would have negatively impacted confidence and sales, as was the case last week,"" he said.

420,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>","'Disaster' U.S. earnings loom, but investors try and look beyond","By Caroline Valetkevitch and David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies are preparing to open their books on a quarter that is set to show the biggest earnings fall since the financial crisis, leaving investors looking for light at the end of the tunnel.
The season unofficially begins on Tuesday with results from some of the biggest U.S. banks. Analysts expect S&P 500 companies overall to report a 44.1% drop in year-over-year earnings for the second quarter, when the coronavirus likely took its biggest toll on companies. Earnings fell 12.8% in the first quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The first coronavirus cases in the United States were identified in January and within weeks much of the economy was shut down to slow the spread, throwing millions of Americans into unemployment. Companies across a range of industries have been dealing with the aftermath ever since. 
The second quarter is expected to be the low point for earnings this year. It would be the second-biggest quarterly earnings drop in IBES data going back to 1968, trailing only 2008's fourth-quarter fall of 67%, when banks and other major lenders were hit at the height of the subprime mortgage crisis.

""It's widely assumed at this point that earnings for Q2 are going to be pretty much a disaster,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.
As a result, many on Wall Street are looking past this quarter's earnings results. The S&P 500 is now trading at 22 times forward earnings, well above the 19 times earnings it reached when it hit a record high in February. Overall, the index is up more than 40% from its March 23 closing low on the back of stimulus measures from the Federal Reserve and U.S. government.
Earnings are expected to turn around in 2021, but investors will be looking for signs that the profit trend is improving.
That is especially important as many companies have been pulling guidance, giving analysts and investors little information on the outlook for earnings.
Second-quarter outlooks from S&P 500 companies totaled just 62 as of Wednesday, far below the 171 average number of quarterly pre-announcements going back to 1997, based on Refinitiv data.
Moreover, in recent months, some investors had begun to speculate on whether companies globally may report earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization - and coronavirus, or ""EBITDAC,"" which would add to the uncertainty surrounding the profit picture.
Worries have been mounting as states reopen and new coronavirus cases increase in parts of the United States, forcing some states to reverse course and shut businesses down again.
Still, another stimulus bill could boost earnings. Negotiations over a new relief bill had been expected to pick up in July.
Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, said earnings expectations could be too low if Congress passes further economic stimulus this month. 
Though not as bad as the second quarter, third- and fourth-quarter earnings still look pretty dire. Analysts see a 24.7% year-over-year decline in earnings for the third quarter and a 13.1% fall in the fourth, while first-quarter 2021 earnings are expected to jump 12.1%, based on Refinitiv's data. 
For a graphic on U.S. quarterly profit performance since 1968:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/azgvorldjpd/eikon.png
All 11 S&P 500 sectors are slated to see a decline in earnings for the second quarter, with energy, consumer discretionary and industrials among the hardest hit, but utilities and technology showing the smallest declines. 
Sandy Villere, a portfolio manager at New Orleans-based Villere Funds, said he is increasingly focused on companies that have the ability to give earnings and revenue projections for the second half of this year or into 2021. 
""The ones that truly can't give guidance are ones that we would steer away from,"" Villere said.
There is a chance investors will find reasons to reward some companies this earnings season, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York, pointing to FedEx (NYSE:FDX), whose shares jumped last week after better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue.
David Ellison, a portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds, said investors will likely continue to look past poor results as long as parts of the economy remain shuttered.    

""A tsunami hit and there's going to be a couple of quarters for them to figure it out,"" he said.

The announcement suggests the potential implications of climate change for monetary, supervisory and trade policy are of concern for the Fed even as it put much of its research power in recent months into understanding and battling the coronavirus pandemic.

422,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",DeVos: Parents could use U.S. education funds elsewhere if pandemic closes schools,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration could allow families to use federal education funding elsewhere if the local public school does not open during the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. education secretary said on Thursday as the Trump administration seeks to pressure states and cities to fully resume in-person classes.
""If schools aren't going to reopen, we're not suggesting pulling funding from education but instead allowing families ... (to) take that money and figure out where their kids can get educated if their schools are going to refuse to open,"" Betsy DeVos told Fox News in an interview.
DeVos, a proponent of private and religious education who has long pushed ""school choice,"" gave no details on the administration's plan. 
U.S. schools are scrambling to prepare for the upcoming academic year as the pandemic surges nationwide, topping 3 million confirmed cases. President Donald Trump has called on schools to reopen, but there is no federal plan to coordinate the effort. 
Local administrators must weigh the needs of children and families and also teachers and staff. In addition to health concerns, the economic consequences are vast. Many working parents rely on schools for child care as well as education. 
Trump, who has made the economy a top issue ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election, on Wednesday threatened to cut school funding and blasted his own administration's guidelines for schools to reopen as ""impractical"" and ""expensive.""
Later, Vice President Mike Pence said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would clarify the guidance next week.
On Thursday, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, asked whether the agency was taking political direction to change its advice after Trump criticism, told ABC News the agency was not revising its guidelines but would ""provide additional information."" 
It was unclear how the administration planned to redirect federal education dollars. The U.S. Congress would have to approve any change in appropriations, which would likely face resistance by Democrats who control the House of Representatives.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said everyone wants to open schools ""but it must be safe for the children."" 
Most public schools are run and funded by local governments, with supplemental funding from the federal government. State and city budgets are hemorrhaging due to the economic slowdown during the pandemic. 
On Wednesday, Pence told reporters the administration would work with Congress, which is weighing another coronavirus aid package, to give states incentive ""to get kids back to school."" 
White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said Trump wanted to tie federal funds directly to students, and not their school district if it closes.
While the highly contagious and potentially fatal disease appears to be less harmful to most younger people, its full impact on youth or their ability to transmit it remains unclear.
School administrators are weighing a variety of measures, including adjusting the school calendar and utilizing online classes, to help keep the virus in check.
But DeVos argued schools can safely re-open now, something echoed by some of Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress.
""If we can work to reopen bars, restaurants, and casinos, we can work together to responsibly open our schools and day cares,"" House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said.
But health experts have said the restart of such economic activity has driven a wave of new cases, particularly in Texas, Florida and Arizona.
Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican and head of the National Governors Association, said Trump's funding threat was ""unfortunate"" but that he did not expect schools to lose money. 

His state, he told MSNBC, would base its decision on input from scientists, teachers and parents. ""We're not going to be bullied or threatened by the president.""

The average for a 30-year fixed loan was 3.03%, the lowest in almost 50 years of data-keeping by  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). The previous record was 3.07%, which held for a week. Rates have plunged as the Federal Reserve holds its benchmark rate near zero and buys mortgage bonds as part of its plan to stimulate the economy.
Analysts have argued that rates could dip below 3% this year.
Low borrowing costs have fueled demand for homes, even with the pandemic battering the economy. Americans stuck at home have been looking to trade up for more space, while a shortage of available inventory has helped prop up prices.
Social-distancing measures kept some buyers and sellers on the sidelines in recent months, but the market is bouncing back, according to Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.
“The residential market has seen a swift rebound of activity as numerous states have begun to ease mandatory stay-at-home orders,” Yun said in a statement.

The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index slipped 0.4 point to 42.9 in the week ended July 5, according to data out Thursday. A measure of attitudes about the buying climate and a gauge of sentiment among respondents in the South, where outbreaks have been prominent, both dropped to three-week lows.
The pause in the overall gauge’s upward momentum since a six-year low in mid-May highlights the link between Americans’ concerns about the pandemic and the outlook for consumer spending. With some states freezing or rolling back their economic reopenings, the health concerns and uncertainty threaten to slow the recovery speed for an economy that entered a recession in February.
The CCI is 24.4 points below its two-decade high in late January and 8.2 points higher than the May low.
The gauge of personal finances also dropped last week as consumers remained cautious about their incomes. At the same time, an index of sentiment about the national economy advanced to an almost three-month high in the wake of consecutive monthly record increases in payrolls.
Further declines in consumer sentiment could add to concerns that the recent bounceback in the economy is beginning to level off. Some workers who were rehired have already been fired again amid a pause in reopenings. Concerns about the opening of schools in the fall also add to trepidation about recovery.
The comfort figures also showed the gender gap in confidence narrowed to its smallest point since March 2017 as confidence among women strengthened.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) will donate over $400 million toward helping small businesses recover from the coronavirus pandemic, giving away all proceeds from its participation in the Payroll Protection Program.
At least $28 million is earmarked for non-profit community lenders catering to Black entrepreneurs, the bank said.
""The hardest hit business in this are minority owned,"" president of consumer banking Mary Mack said in an interview.
""If we look at the communities we serve and the intent and spirit of the program, we believe it was to lean in to help those businesses that were perhaps the most fragile."" 
More than half of all small business owners do not expect to grow revenue over the next 12 months, a Wells Fargo survey found. The pandemic has shuttered Black owned-businesses at twice the rate of small businesses overall.
Other major lenders, including  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), have made similar pledges not to profit from the government stimulus program meant to help small businesses hard hit by mandatory COVID-19 related shutdowns. But those banks have said they will use some of the fees generated to cover costs associated with quickly rolling out the hulking infrastructure needed to run the program. 
As of June, Wells Fargo funded $10.1 billion in PPP loans and focused its participation on smaller business owners, the bank said. Out of 179,000 loans Wells Fargo processed, 84% went to companies with fewer than 10 employees and 60% were under $25,000.
Its average loan size was $56,000, the bank said. That compares with an average loan size of $123,00 at JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM).
Chase and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) provided 4,258 and 3,345 loans of $1 million or more, compared with Wells Fargo’s 929, according to a Reuters analysis of program data released on Monday.

427,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 08:56AM ET</span>",The man who led Wirecard into insolvency,"By Arno Schuetze, Sabine Wollrab and Patricia Uhlig
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - On the night of June 18, Wirecard AG’s new compliance chief stayed up late at his office in the company’s low-rise headquarters in the Munich suburb of Aschheim to pore over the payment firm’s books.
It was James Freis’ first formal day on the job after his start date had suddenly been accelerated by the refusal that morning of Wirecard’s auditors to sign off on the 2019 accounts and the company’s suspension of its chief operating officer. As Freis, a former financial investigator at the U.S. Treasury, scanned the books he was struck by Wirecard’s unusual practice of relying on a third party to hold large sums of money in escrow on behalf of its subsidiaries that are present in countries where it doesn't have its own operating licenses, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
The evidence that fraud had probably been committed was obvious to anyone with financial market experience, this person said. The next day, Wirecard’s long-time chief executive officer resigned and Freis became interim CEO.
Over the following week, the 49-year old American was involved in a rapid wave of decisions that culminated in Wirecard filing for insolvency, according to people involved in talks on restructuring its debts. In the end, the process left creditors with scant hope of recovering $4 billion they are owed and investors holding shares that were nearly worthless.
Prosecutors are now investigating Wirecard’s other senior managers on suspicion of fraud, breach of trust, false accounting and market manipulation. They have arrested former CEO Markus Braun, have a warrant out for the former chief operating officer and have widened the field of suspects to include all management board members except Freis. No charges have been filed.
Wirecard and its supervisory board chairman declined to comment on events in the week leading up to the company’s insolvency filing and the accounting issues. The company has acknowledged that the funds likely didn’t exist but hasn’t publicly identified who it believes to be responsible. It has said the decision to file for insolvency was because Wirecard was over-indebted and not in a position to meet its financial commitments.
Braun, who has been released on bail, has denied wrongdoing. A lawyer for the former CEO did not respond to a request for comment but has previously declined to comment. 
The former chief operating officer, Jan Marsalek, remains at large and his whereabouts are unknown. His lawyer declined to comment. The company fired Marsalek on June 22.
Freis moved to Frankfurt from Washington six years ago to become head of compliance at Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn), which runs the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Wirecard announced Freis’ appointment as Chief Compliance Officer on May 8, ten days after forensic accountants at KPMG had publicly raised red flags about Wirecard’s accounting for the three prior years saying they had been unable to verify the existence either of revenue from the third-party partners or the balances held in escrow.
Freis was in the Bavarian capital ahead of his official July 1 start date to house hunt, when Wirecard issued a surprise statement. On June 18, the company announced that its long-time audit firm EY, previously known as Ernst & Young, could not confirm the existence of 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion) supposedly held in trust at two Asian banks - a quarter of its balance sheet.
That evening, Wirecard suspended Marsalek, the COO, and announced Freis would assume his new post with immediate effect.
Freis appeared in a video statement posted by Braun on Wirecard’s website late that night. In the video, Braun introduced the new compliance chief, who nodded awkwardly in acknowledgment. Braun also said in the video that Wirecard may have been the victim of a fraud ""of substantial dimensions,"" without specifying who may have been responsible.
It was that night that Freis spent looking through the company’s books. The next morning, Freis reported his initial findings to the supervisory board, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Within hours, Braun had resigned.
Freis also personally wrote a corporate statement that disclosed the findings, the person with knowledge of the matter said. The statement, released by the company in the pre-dawn hours of the morning of Monday June 22, said the management board assessed the ""prevailing likelihood"" that the 1.9 billion euros held in trustee accounts ""do not exist.”
EY, which had audited Wirecard for more than a decade, has said it uncovered a sophisticated fraud and reported its findings immediately to the supervisory board. The audit firm declined further comment.
Freis was also under pressure from Wirecard’s lenders. EY's refusal to sign off on the accounts meant that creditors would be able to call in some 2 billion euros in loans. Freis worked over the weekend with Wirecard’s freshly appointed restructuring advisers to get a dialogue going with creditors, according to sources with knowledge of the matter.
Some 15 banks agreed on the Monday to roll over their credit line to Wirecard. But, by Wednesday, it had become clear that a move by Germany's financial regulator, BaFin, to ring-fence Wirecard's banking subsidiary from the rest of the group would tie Freis' hands. 
The problem Freis faced, according to a person involved in the talks between Wirecard and its lenders, was that he would be unable to pay the company’s bills if the regulator blocked access to the necessary account at Wirecard Bank. 
Freis saw that, even if the loans were rolled over, Wirecard would probably to have to file for insolvency in three to six months, the person involved in the talks said. But by postponing the inevitable, he risked criminal liability, this person added. Delaying insolvency is a criminal offence in Germany. The next day, June 25, Wirecard announced it would file for insolvency.

Freis continues to oversee day-to-day operations at the company while the administrator sells of the remnants of Wirecard.

(Reuters) - A new $1 billion fund backed by 20 drugmakers including  Merck & Co  Inc (N:MRK) and  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) is aiming to bolster struggling antibiotic companies and sustain a pipeline for new treatments, an industry group said on Thursday.
Antibiotic makers have struggled with anemic investment and bankruptcies, even after the approval of new drugs, as fears of drug-resistant microbes force hospitals to adopt a more conservative approach toward such treatments.
Public health authorities have raised alarms about a looming health crisis, saying deaths from antibiotic-resistant bacteria could dwarf that from the coronavirus pandemic.
The new fund, led by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations, has raised nearly $1 billion so far and aims to help shore up investment in smaller biotech companies after several large drugmakers, such as Sanofi SA (PA:SASY) bowed out of the space.
The initiative ""gives these biotechs access to the kinds of capabilities that large pharmaceutical companies have, such as manufacturing and regulatory,"" said Silas Holland, head of external affairs for the fund and director of global public policy at Merck.
An independent scientific panel will review and recommend funding for companies developing promising novel antibiotics, Holland said. The group's goal is to bring two to four new antibiotics to patients within a decade.
The fund seeks to serve as a temporary solution until new legislation can offer a more permanent fix. 

""This is intended to help temporarily sustain this pipeline while policymakers put in place incentives,"" Holland said.

The pandemic halted the reform, the single greatest revamp of the pension system since World War Two, in its tracks in February, and presents President Emmanuel Macron with a tough political decision as he seeks to recast his presidency.
Deferring the reform, which includes raising the retirement age by two years to 64 to collect a full pension, until after the 2022 presidential elections might win union and voter support. But it would undermine his already-weakened credibility as a reformer.
On the eve this week's government reshuffle, Macron said he was not going to jettison the reform. Castex on Wednesday said the focus now should be on the financing of the pension system, one of the most generous among industrialised nations.
""Clearly, the priority today is jobs,"" said Laurent Berger, head of the reform-minded CFDT union, which backs the reform's aim of unifying the myriad pension funds into a single, point-based system.
Berger spoke after meeting the prime minister, who is hosting all unions individually ahead of a resumption of talks the premier wants before July 20.
The pension reform is central to Macron's ambition of creating a more flexible and competitive labour force. But it has infuriated trade unions who argue the reform will erode hard-earned benefits and leave pensioners worse off.
The reform triggered a wave of street protests and public transport strikes that lasted weeks at the turn of the year. 
Underscoring the financing crunch, the independent pensions advisory body COR forecast the pension deficit would balloon to 29.4 billion euros in 2020 from a previously anticipated 4.2 billion euro shortfall, due to a sharp decline in contributions.

""There are other ways to find the 25 billion (than raising the retirement age),"" said Yves Veyrier, leader of the hardleft Force Ouvriere union.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank is studying recent data showing inflation is somewhat above expectations to see if there is room for a ""residual"" cut in interest rates, its president Roberto Campos Neto told Reuters.
In an interview late on Wednesday, he said he expected the bank's growth projections to improve as pandemic emergency income relief payments and credit for small and medium companies continued to spur improved growth.

433,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>",Prominent plaintiffs' firms sought government bailout to stay afloat,"By Caroline Spiezio and Tina Bellon
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several prominent plaintiffs' law firms, known for striking large settlements with companies like German carmaker Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and  Equifax Inc  (NYSE:EFX), were approved for loans that totaled tens of millions of dollars in government aid meant to help small businesses stay afloat during the coronavirus pandemic. 
San Francisco-based Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, which has 100 lawyers and bills itself on its website as ""among the largest law firms in the United States that only represent plaintiffs"" was approved to receive between $2 million and $5 million under the Paycheck Protection Program, according to data released Monday by the U.S. Treasury Department and Small Business Administration. 
Steven Fineman, the firm's managing partner, said Lieff Cabraser used the loan to compensate lawyers and staff members and prevent layoffs. 
""We applied for a PPP loan at a time when our firm's lawyers and staff were all required to work remotely... and we had no idea how the pandemic would impact our finances,"" Fineman said in an email. 
Fineman declined to comment on Lieff Cabraser's finances, which are not public. 
Other prominent plaintiffs' firms that were approved for government aid include Motley Rice, Morgan & Morgan and Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, according to a review of the government data by Reuters. 
U.S. law firms have been hard hit by the pandemic and nearly 15,000 firms got the green light to receive up to $13.1 billion in federal loans. 
Borrowers seeking PPP loans must certify ""in good faith"" that the aid is necessary after taking into account their business activity and their ""ability to access other sources of liquidity."" 
Private law firms are not required to publicly disclose their finances.Unlike defense firms, which charge clients by the hour, plaintiffs' lawyers in the United States largely work on a contingency basis and receive a cut of the final settlement. 
And with many courts shuttered and jury trials on pause, settlements and attorney payouts have been delayed, according to plaintiffs' lawyer Stuart Grant, the managing director of Bench Walk Advisors, a litigation finance group.
Fineman said in an email that the pandemic has also ""resulted in corporate defendants being unwilling or unable to settle."" 
""Like most plaintiff-side firms, our revenue does not come in on a [predictable] schedule, but our expenses must, of course, be paid as they come due,"" Fineman said.
Two legal industry experts said that plaintiffs' firms have a business model that should enable them to weather financial uncertainty and questioned whether they really needed government aid. 
Successful plaintiffs' firms ""almost certainly have resources to carry them over when waiting for big settlements,"" said Herbert Kritzer, a University of Minnesota Law School professor. 
Lieff Cabraser, which negotiated a nearly $15 billion settlement with Volkswagen over its diesel emissions scandal in 2016, in January was one of three firms approved to receive fees of up to $40 million for representing truck owners and lessees in litigation against Navistar (NYSE:NAV) International Corp, court records showed.
Leiff Cabraser's Fineman said that the firm was one of three co-leads in that settlement, and that the fees were shared among 25 firms. 
Motley Rice, which has been one of the lead firms negotiating settlements worth potentially tens of billions of dollars with drug manufacturers and distributors accused of fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic, applied for at least two PPP loans, totaling up to $10.35 million. Its website lists 108 attorneys. 
Joe Rice, co-founder of Motley Rice, said Wednesday that the firm's reason for applying for PPP aid is ""fairly obvious, to keep the employees employed."" 
Morgan & Morgan, an Orlando, Florida-based personal injury firm known for its television ads, applied at least four times, for up to $18 million. Representatives of the firm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Bernstein Litowitz, which last month was awarded $30.4 million in fees and expenses after it secured a $149 million settlement resolving an investor lawsuit related to Equifax Inc’s 2017 data breach, was approved for between $2 million and $5 million in aid. 
Bernstein Litowitz spokeswoman Lisa Olney said Wednesday the firm did not have immediate comment. 
NO ONE UNSCATHED 
Although plaintiffs' firms may have large cash reserves from settlements, the pandemic has not left them unscathed. 
They generally must shell out large sums of money to fund years-long litigation whose outcome is uncertain. 
Still, two prominent plaintiffs' lawyers said they saw no reason to apply for taxpayer-funded loans despite the upheaval. 
""The very nature of our business is that revenue streams are choppy, and we don't rely on consistent, predictable paid invoices from billing clients,"" said Paul Geller, a founding partner of plaintiffs' firm Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd. 
Mark Lanier, a Texas-based lawyer whose Lanier Law Firm has won several multimillion- and billion-dollar verdicts against companies including Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and  Merck & Co  (N:MRK), said his firm did not believe it needed free money to keep going. 

""Our folks are working fine from home, and we haven't suffered one bit!"" Lanier said.

434,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 06:57AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday, July 9th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The U.S. releases jobless claims data, a day after posting a new record high for Covid-19 infections.  A wary stock market is set to open mixed. Joe Biden makes a keynote speech on economic policy while Donald Trump awaits a Supreme Court ruling on his tax returns. Metals surge - and not just gold - as price data out of China foster hopes about its economic rebound and drive local stocks to a new record. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, July 9th.
1. Jobless claims due
The U.S. will release its latest data for initial and continuing jobless claims at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), to a market increasingly concerned about the risk of a fresh downturn due to the pandemic.
Continuing claims had actually ticked up in last week’s figures but are expected to fall by over 300,000 to 18.95 million, while initial claims – which have repeatedly overshot analysts’ expectations in recent weeks – are expected to slow by another 52,000 to 1.375 million.
The release comes as the U.S. reported a new record of over 62,000 fresh cases on Wednesday, nearly 10% above the previous daily record. The Covid Tracking Project recorded over 900 deaths from the disease for the second day running. Johns Hopkins now puts the U.S. death toll at over 132,000, just under a quarter of the global total.
2. Yuan regains 6-handle as deflation fears ease
The Chinese yuan broke through the 7 level against the dollar as the roaring rally in mainland equities continued unabated.
By close of trade in Asia, the yuan was quoted at 6.9845 to the dollar, its lowest since mid-March, on the back of another surge in mainland stock indices. The Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 closed up 1.4% and has now risen 17.8% so far this month.
The latest surge came after figures showing a bigger rebound in domestic price trends than expected, allaying fears of deflation in factory gate prices.  Producer prices were down only 3.0% on the year in June, after being down 3.7% in May – a figure that now looks likely to mark the short-term bottom. Consumer prices also fell by only 0.1% in June, rather than the 0.5% expected.
3. Stocks set to open mixed; Walgreens, airlines in focus
U.S. stock are set to open mixed with one eye on the jobless claims numbers.
By 6:45 AM ET, the Dow futures contract was down 97 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.3%.
In the spotlight later will be Walgreens Boots (NASDAQ:WBA), which is set to release its quarterly numbers, as well as airline stocks. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) said it may furlough up to 45% of its workforce, some 36,000 people, by October as a result of the drop in demand for air travel.
Also of note could be General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) stock, after a judge rejected a GM suit alleging FCA had bribed union officials to get a sweeter deal on pay than its rivals.
4. Biden to speak, Trump to get Supreme Court ruling on tax returns
The Democratic Party’s presidential nominee Joe Biden will deliver a speech outlining some of his key economic priorities.
According to various reports, Biden will talk up “buy American” policies, especially as regards government procurement, while also signalling an expansion of healthcare coverage. There have been few details about his plans on taxes, which have been a major concern for investors in the past.
Biden’s opponent in the presidential election, Donald Trump, is meanwhile set to hear from the Supreme Court on whether his tax returns can be released to Congressional investigators and prosecutors. Trump has refused subpoenas from three House committees controlled by Democrats, as well as Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. 
5. Base metals shine as gold consolidates
Metals continue to post new highs on a cocktail of factors from fears of currency debasement by central banks to mine closures forced by the pandemic.
Gold futures were consolidating, down 0.3%, after hitting 9-year highs earlier in the week, but the world’s two most important base metals – Copper and Aluminum – both rallied on a wave of Chinese bullishness. Aluminum futures in London rose to their highest since March 11, while copper futures hit their highest level since April last year, helped in part by an announcement from Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) that it will close a smelter in New Zealand and put other facilities under review.
Copper prices are being squeezed, among other things, by the spread of Covid-19 around Latin America, where many of the world’s biggest mines are located."
435,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Chinese banks prepare contingency plans over threat of U.S. sanctions, sources say","By Cheng Leng, Julie Zhu and Engen Tham
BEIJING/HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese state lenders are revamping contingency plans in anticipation of U.S. legislation that could penalise banks for serving officials who implement the new national security law for Hong Kong, sources at five state financial institutions said.
In worst-case scenarios under consideration by the Bank of China (SS:601988) (HK:3988) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) (SS:601398) (HK:1398), the lenders are looking at the possibility of being cut off from U.S. dollars or losing access to U.S. dollar settlements, two sources said.
The dollar is the dominant global currency for international payments and central bank reserves.
""We are hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst. You never know how things will turn out,"" one of the sources said.
Reflecting concern over the erosion of the former British colony's autonomy, the U.S. House and Senate unanimously passed the bill last week. It has yet to be signed into law by President Donald Trump.
The bill calls for sanctions on Chinese officials and others who help violate Hong Kong's autonomy and on financial institutions that do business with them. But it does not spell out what the sanctions would look like.
""There are sanctions in this bill which could be interpreted to prevent a bank from clearing some dollar transactions via U.S. institutions, but unlike other congressional sanctions bills there are not specific provisions mandating it,"" said Nick Turner, a lawyer specialising in sanctions and anti-money laundering at Steptoe & Johnson in Hong Kong.
He said it remained to be seen whether the law would be used in such a way.
In a milder scenario being looked at by the Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF) (AgBank) (SS:601288) (HK:1288), lenders would need to find ways to address the problem of clients blacklisted by the United States, especially those who might face a sudden loss of liquidity, a third source said.
The sources all declined to be named as the planning is confidential. Bank of China, ICBC and AgBank did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
LEASING FIRMS TOO 
The contingency planning has been initiated by the banks themselves, three of the sources said.
The People's Bank of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, top financial regulators overseeing country's financial stability and the banking sector, did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
The worst-case scenario under consideration by the Bank of China also envisions what would happen in the event of a run on its branches in Hong Kong if customers feared that it would run out of U.S. currency, one of the sources said.
It is also looking at the experience of banks in Iran, the same person said. Iranian banks have been hit from time to time by U.S. sanctions dating back to the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Bank of China, the country's most international lender, had the biggest exposure of the country's big four lenders to the greenback at the end of 2019, with about $433 billion in liabilities.
China's top four banks, which also include ICBC, China Construction Bank (SS:601939) (HK:0939) and AgBank, had a combined 7.5 trillion yuan ($1 trillion) in U.S. dollar liabilities at the end of 2019, annual reports show. 
The sources also said that least three state-run leasing firms, including an ICBC unit and CSIC Leasing, are also making contingency plans. Leasing firms are often heavily reliant on dollar borrowing to fund purchases of aircraft, machinery and facilities. 

ICBC Leasing and CSIC Leasing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

438,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>","China charges on, gold reaches nine-year high","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares were rising again after a two-day wobble on Thursday as China's markets continued their charge, and something between fear and greed propelled gold to a nine-year high. 
Chinese stocks set their longest winning streak in two years and the yuan had strengthened past 7 per dollar overnight [.SS], despite rising tension over Hong Kong and the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19.
It was the Shenzhen blue-chip index's eighth straight day of gains, adding another 1.5% to its 16% surge this month, and pushed Europe in the right direction after some hesitation caused by uninspiring German data. 
Also improving risk sentiment was the dollar’s downward momentum – it was at a one-month low against the euro, a three- week low versus the British pound and four-month lows against the Swiss franc. 
That was a green light for emerging markets too. MSCI's EM currency index was at a one-month high. Trade- and commodity- related currencies also reacted to China's gains. The New Zealand dollar was at the highest since January and the Aussie dollar at a one-month high. 
""We've seen a more generalised view back to riskier assets. The Chinese equity surge has been the poster child for risk-on move across the last few sessions,"" said Jeremy Stretch, CIBC Capital Markets' head of G10 FX strategy.
Asia's investors have been riding high after a front-page editorial in Monday's China Securities Journal extolling market fundamentals, which was taken as official encouragement to buy stocks.
State-run media warned on Thursday that investors should still pursue rational investments and manage risks, but that didn't rein in the bulls.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.8% and touched a 20-week high. The yuan rose to a four-month high as it broke through the 7-per-dollar barrier. 
""Broadly speaking, the Chinese economy is coping better not only with a recovery but also in dealing with the potential of a second wave (of infections),"" said National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) FX strategist Rodrigo Catril.
""Rightly or wrongly, that market is liking the idea that the yuan can strengthen on the back of equity inflows.""
Although China's factory-gate prices fell for a fifth straight month in June, signs of a pickup suggest a slow but steady recovery remains intact.
Elsewhere, German export figures recovered less than expected in May as demand remained subdued despite lockdowns being lifted in large parts of Europe. 
They jumped by 9% on the month after diving by 24% in April, but economists had been hoping for a near 14% bounce and the numbers remained almost 27% lower than their pre-crisis level in February, the Federal Statistics office said.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s chief international strategist, Alan Ruskin, said the yuan enjoyed the ""perfect combination"" of tight monetary policy, yield advantage and equity demand.
In any case, its rally ignored growing pressure from the West over China's tightening grip on Hong Kong, surging U.S. coronavirus cases and a fresh lockdown of 5 million Australians in Melbourne. 
Australia's benchmark ASX 200 index rose 1% and Japan's Nikkei rose 0.6%. The Australian dollar rose 0.2% to $0.6995, but - perhaps indicating a cap on exuberance - it was unable to break past resistance at $0.70.
U.S. Treasuries were not sold into the rally, either. Nor were the safe havens of gold or the Japanese yen. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasuries remained under pressure at 0.6545% and gold at $1,810.73 an ounce.
EARNINGS AHEAD
The U.S. earnings season approaches with investor hopes high for a stabilisation, but warning signals are flashing and Federal Reserve officials raised fresh doubts on Wednesday about the durability of the rebound.
The United States has also posted its largest number of daily new coronavirus cases since the outbreak began and global tensions are on the rise.
U.S. jobs data due at 1230 GMT will offer the next checkup on the recovery's progress, followed by results next Tuesday from J.P. Morgan,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), then Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) on Thursday.
""Earnings season is upon us, and we really want to see what it looks like,"" said Jun Bei Liu, a portfolio manager at Australia's Tribeca Investment Partners.

439,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>","Democrat Biden to unveil plan to boost manufacturing, innovation","By Joseph Ax and Jarrett Renshaw
(Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Thursday will propose boosting manufacturing and innovation by spending $700 billion in his first four-year term to procure more American-made goods for the U.S. government and invest in research and development.
Biden will outline the plan, which the campaign said would create 5 million new jobs, in a speech in northeastern Pennsylvania, near his childhood hometown of Scranton.
At the same time, Republican Vice President Mike Pence will attend a business roundtable focused on reopening the economy in Malvern, a suburb of Philadelphia, before speaking to the Philadelphia police union later in the day.
The opposing visits underscore Pennsylvania's status as a key battleground state in November's presidential election. President Donald Trump carried the state in 2016 by a slim margin, the first Republican to do so since 1988.
Biden's announcement is the first prong of a broader economic plan titled ""Build Back Better"" to revive the U.S. economy after the devastating coronavirus pandemic.
The plan includes proposals to build a clean energy economy; support caregivers, including those providing child and elder care; and advance racial equity.
Biden will offer more details about those areas in the coming weeks, senior campaign officials said.
Biden proposed trillions of dollars in new federal efforts on climate change, healthcare and infrastructure even before the pandemic, and he has since called for more stimulus spending. It remains to be seen whether he could convince Congress to support such ambitious proposals.
Both Biden and Pence are visiting areas that have grown less politically hospitable for their party in the Trump era.
Biden will spend the day in Lackawanna County, a longtime Democratic stronghold that like many parts of Pennsylvania with large concentrations of union blue-collar workers has swung hard toward Trump.

Meanwhile, Chester County, where Pence will travel, is one of several counties near Philadelphia that have seen Democratic gains since 2016, reflecting a broader trend in suburbs around the country.

442,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 03:35AM ET</span>",BOJ offers bleakest view on Japan's regions in over a decade,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan cut its economic view for all of the country's nine regions for the second straight quarter, the first such downgrade since Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, backing signs the economy could fall deeper into recession.
The move underscores just how much damage the coronavirus pandemic has done to the world's third largest economy.
In its quarterly report released on Thursday, the BOJ offered a bleaker view for most regions than three months ago due to recent data pointing to slumping factory output, consumption and capital expenditure.
""Exports have been shrinking further as COVID-19 has led to a plunge in global automobile sales,"" said a transport machinery maker in southern Japan in the report.
The July report said all of Japan's nine regional areas saw their economies ""worsening"" or in a ""severe state"" due to the outbreak which forced governments around the world to impose restrictions on businesses and movement earlier this year.
The warning comes ahead of the central bank's interest rate decision next week, when it is expected to hold off on loosening monetary policy further to gauge the impact of stimulus measures deployed in March and April.
In a speech delivered to a meeting of the BOJ's regional branch managers in Tokyo on Thursday, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said consumer prices were likely to keep falling for the time being as Japan's economy worsens, though he stuck to the central bank's optimistic outlook.
""Japan's economy is expected to improve as the impact of the pandemic subsides, supported by pent-up demand ... an accommodative monetary environment and the government's stimulus package,"" Kuroda said.

Japan slipped into recession in the first quarter and analysts expect the pandemic to drive a sharp economic contraction of over 20% in the April-June period.

(Reuters) - Several Silicon Valley firms backed by venture capitalists were unsure over whether to apply for a U.S. pandemic aid program, but data analyzed by CB Insights shows a big chunk of companies that raised funds this year also applied for the aid.
Some venture capitalists had advised their portfolio companies to avoid dipping into the $660 billion program unless they were out of cash or had no other way to raise funds. Some said they felt the funds should be reserved for ""Main Street"" small businesses without deep-pocketed backers.
But CB Insights has found more than 9,600 companies that were backed by venture capital, private equity, angel, and other investors were approved for $150,000 or more in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. Over 2,200 of them raised money last year, and more than 1,200 of them raised money this year.
For its analysis, released on Tuesday, CB Insights used its company-matching technology on a big data dump by the Treasury Department released Monday of the names of companies that were approved for the loans.
Businesses that applied for aid needed to certify the ""current economic uncertainty makes the loan necessary"" for ongoing operations.
Kathleen McGee, a lawyer at Lowenstein Sandler in New York City, has advised companies that if they have cash in the bank that will sustain them for a year, then it could be a red flag for regulators later.
Investors with the most portfolio companies listed as approved for the loans were Plug and Play Accelerator with 140 companies followed by Y Combinator with 129 companies.
Andreessen Horowitz, among top venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, had 55 portfolio companies on the list, CB Insights data shows. Sequoia Capital, another big venture capital player, had 23 portfolio companies on the list.

445,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 12:00AM ET</span>",China's producer prices extend declines but recovery signs emerge,"By Stella Qiu and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory gate prices fell for a fifth straight month in June as the coronavirus pandemic weighed heavily on industrial demand, although signs of a pickup in some parts of the sector suggest a slow economic recovery remains intact.
The producer price index (PPI) in June fell 3.0% from a year earlier, China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement on Thursday, slower than a 3.2% fall tipped by a Reuters poll of analysts and a 3.7% decline in May.
However, in a sign of potential improvement in the manufacturing sector, PPI rose 0.4% from the previous month, turning around from a 0.4% decline in May.
""The change was driven by an across-the-board increase in raw materials, manufactured goods and consumer goods price inflation,"" said Martin Rasmussen, China Economist at Capital Economics, in a note after the data release.
""With fiscal stimulus and infrastructure spending still ramping up, we think that economic activity and producer prices are set to recover further in the coming months.""
Indeed, orders for infrastructure materials and equipment have helped industrial output recover faster in China than most places emerging from COVID-19 lockdowns, but further expansion will be hard to attain without stronger broad-based demand and exports.
ANZ expects China's PPI will stay in deflation this year, with declines averaging around 2.0% due to the prolonged pandemic.
Even with signs of a moderation in China's upstream deflation, ""it remains debatable if the unprecedented extent of policy stimulus will lead to a quick rebound in industrial inflation,"" said Zhaopeng Xing, China Markets Economist at ANZ.
An official survey on the manufacturing sector last week showed activity expanded in June although still at a modest pace, as Beijing's success in drastically reducing the number of new coronavirus infections allowed it to reopen its economy.
But export orders have continued to contract, reflecting the widespread global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many Chinese manufacturers are grappling with falling profits and have been forced to let workers go to cut costs.
The pandemic, which has infected more than 12 million and killed about 546,000 globally, has sunk world demand and sent many economies into deflation as factories and retailers shut their doors.
The inflation data also showed consumer prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, in line with forecasts and slightly faster from 2.4% growth in May.
Core inflation - which excludes food and energy costs - remained benign last month at 0.9%，easing from May's rise of 1.1%.
Some analysts have recently warned of inflationary pressures from the heavy floods across a large part of the country this summer, which could hit vegetable supplies and drive a surge in prices. 

China's economy is expected to return to growth in the second quarter, as it recovers from the sharp contraction in the January-March quarter when the coronavirus outbreak in the mainland reached its peak.

446,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 06:27PM ET</span>","Lacking Powers in Virus Fight, Japan’s Paying Businesses to Shut","(Bloomberg) -- Japan has begun requesting some nightlife establishments to suspend their businesses in return for monetary compensation, signaling the nation is stepping up its fight against coronavirus outbreaks amid growing public outcry.
Kagoshima prefecture in southern Japan, where more than 80 infections have been traced to one cabaret club, will pay up to 300,000 yen ($2,791) for night time entertainment establishments to close for two weeks starting Wednesday. In northwest Tokyo, Toshima Ward has asked the capital for financial assistance to pay host clubs that agree to suspend their operation.
That’s a turnaround from when many such businesses weren’t able to claim subsidies during the state of emergency. Japan has no legal power to force businesses to close, which meant that some of these nighttime establishments stayed open throughout the country’s voluntary shutdown during April and May. With infections now increasing from the network of clubs, pressure is growing for a way to halt the virus’s spread.
“We’d like to use Toshima Ward’s measures as a model case and use the results to create compensation structures for other wards and cities, many of which are also worried about this issue,” Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said Tuesday, national broadcaster NHK reported.

Approaches to mitigating the virus have diverged around the world as countries deal with new flare-ups on a case-by-case basis at a local level. In the U.S., businesses and social activities are resuming even as states record daily infection numbers in the tens of thousands. In Australia, Melbourne went under stay-at-home orders again this week after recording new daily cases of less than 200 but were a daily record for the state of Victoria.
Japan, which is almost fully reopened for business after a state of emergency in April and May, has refrained from asking for broad shop closures again despite a recent increase in case numbers. The number of new confirmed infections has exceeded 100 in Tokyo for six days in a row, stoking worry that the country may be heading toward another wave of infections. The city broke the streak on Wednesday, with 75 cases being reported.
Officials have maintained that the country can continue to reopen as its medical system is not overwhelmed and most new cases have been traceable. Japan will allow outdoor events of up to 5,000 people to take place from Friday. The government is also slated to begin a travel campaign next month that would give stipends to residents to travel domestically in order to spur regional tourism.
Most of the confirmed infections in recent weeks have been people in their 20s and 30s, who experience lighter symptoms and may not require hospitalization. Many of the new numbers are also from mass testing of night club workers and guests. The initial focus of night club cluster infections was in Shinjuku and its Kabukicho red light district. Since late June, many cases have been traced to host clubs in the bustling Ikebukuro district of Toshima Ward, the Mainichi newspaper reported.

“This is a good development. With the monetary support, many clubs could choose to close,” said Kaori Kohga, the head of the industry association representing hostesses and clubs. “One point of concern is that the money may only go to the business management, not the individual hosts.”
With many of the hosts and hostesses that work at the clubs living paycheck to paycheck, it would be better if initiatives like the Shinjuku Ward -- which began giving its residents who were infected with the virus 100,000 yen in support funds -- and Toshima’s were combined to support the closure of the clubs, Kohga said.

447,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 06:12PM ET</span>",New U.S. CDC school reopening guidelines promised after Trump complains,"By Doina Chiacu and Daphne Psaledakis
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans to issue new guidelines for reopening schools, Vice President Mike Pence said on Wednesday, after President Donald Trump criticized the agency's recommendations as too expensive and impractical.
Trump, a Republican who is seeking re-election in November, accused Democrats of wanting to keep schools shut for political reasons and threatened to cut off federal funding to schools that do not reopen, despite a surge in coronavirus cases.
""I disagree with @CDCgov on their very tough & expensive guidelines for opening schools. While they want them open, they are asking schools to do very impractical things. I will be meeting with them!!!"" Trump said on Twitter.
Flanked by top administration health and education officials, Pence said the CDC next week will issue a ""new set of tools ... to give more clarity on the guidance going forward.
""The president said today we just don't want the guidance to be too tough,"" Pence said at a White House coronavirus task force briefing at the Department of Education.
CDC Director Robert Redfield stressed that agency guidelines were not requirements. 
""It would be personally very disappointing to me, and I know my agency, if we saw that individuals were using these guidelines as a rationale for not reopening our schools,"" Redfield said.
White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told reporters the White House did not pressure the CDC to revise its recommendations.
The CDC has made a number of recommendations for schools, including testing for COVID-19, dividing students into small groups, serving packaged lunches in classrooms instead of cafeterias, and minimizing sharing of school supplies.
It has advised that seats be spaced at least six feet apart and that sneeze guards and partitions be put in place when social distancing is not possible. 
Administration officials said local leaders would tailor their decisions on how schools reopen.
""Ultimately it's not a matter of if schools should reopen, it's simply a matter of how. They must fully open,"" Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said. 
States are responsible for primary and secondary education under the U.S. Constitution, but some have been holding off on deciding when and how to open schools, concerned about the resurgence of coronavirus across the country.
The U.S. outbreak has crossed the 3 million mark in confirmed cases, with a death toll of 131,336, according to a Reuters tally. 
""The Dems think it would be bad for them politically if U.S. schools open before the November Election, but is important for the children & families. May cut off funding if not open!"" Trump said on Twitter.
Acknowledging that the lion's share of school funding comes from states, Pence said that the administration would work with Congress to look for ways ""to give states a strong incentive and encouragement to get kids back to school."" 
""It's time for us to get our kids back to school,"" he said.
The federal government provides some supplementary funding for schools, including through congressional appropriations. With Democrats controlling the House of Representatives, any effort to curtail funding is sure to face roadblocks.
McEnany said Trump is ""looking at potential redirecting (of funding) to make sure it goes to the student and it is most likely tied to the student and not to a district where schools are closed.""
Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia said school reopenings were necessary for the U.S. economic recovery. Business and conservative groups have said parents need to get back to work.
On Tuesday, Trump said he would pressure state governors to open schools in the fall.
However, the surge in U.S. cases has raised concerns about the increased risk of children spreading the virus to vulnerable adults at home as well as to older teachers and school staff.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the federal government has no authority on schools and his state will announce its reopening plans in the first week of August.

In neighboring New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy said he planned to reopen state schools in the fall, but reserved the right to ""tweak that if it means saving lives.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican labor lawyer Susana Prieto on Wednesday said she appealed a court order banning her from a labor court in the northern state of Tamaulipas, arguing it violates a new trade deal by stopping her from fighting for workers' rights.
The 2-1/2 year ban from the Special Local Board No. 6 for Conciliation and Arbitration in Matamoros, a border city with dozens of factories in the U.S.-Mexico supply chain, was a condition of Prieto's release last week after the activist spent nearly a month in jail on charges tied to a labor protest.
Prieto said she represents 1,000 factory workers in cases under review at the board.
Her detention prompted U.S. union leaders and Democratic lawmakers to call for Prieto's release, citing the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that aims to improve union independence and worker rights in Mexico.
""These workers have been left without their defender,"" Prieto, the founder of an independent union, told a news conference. 
Prieto has also said a judge prohibited her from re-entering the state except for court hearings, while a statement from the Tamaulipas prosecutor's office said only that she could no longer visit the labor board, without detailing a wider ban. 
A spokesman for the prosecutor did not immediately reply to a request from Reuters to review the judge's comments.
Workers from Tridonex, a unit of U.S. auto parts firm Cardone Industries, Inc., had protested outside the same labor board in March, demanding new, better representation.
Tamaulipas authorities accused Prieto of organizing the group, which they said was violent, charging her with having committed crimes against officials.

Prieto denies the charges. Her lawyers filed an appeal on Monday seeking to overturn the court's order.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador lavished praise on President Donald Trump at their first meeting on Wednesday, saying the U.S. leader treated Mexico with respect despite his history of threatening tariffs and insulting Mexicans.
The leftist Mexican leader made his first foreign trip as president to the White House, where he and Trump accentuated the positive in their public remarks while largely glossing over their differences on business, illegal drugs and migration.
""What I most appreciate is that you have never tried to impose anything on us that violates or damages our sovereignty,"" Lopez Obrador said in Spanish, turning to look at Trump as the two spoke in the White House Rose Garden before signing a joint declaration.
""You have never attempted to treat us like a colony,"" he added. ""That's why I am here to say to the people of the United States that your president has treated us with kindness and respect.""
The White House said all members of the Mexican delegation, including Lopez Obrador, were tested for the coronavirus before they met Trump, as was the case when Poland's president visited on June 24.
Mindful of the coronavirus pandemic, which is still surging in Mexico and the United States, the two leaders did not shake hands when Trump greeted Lopez Obrador on his arrival. Neither wore face masks. 
Trump said a joint declaration that the two men signed would commit both countries ""to a shared future of prosperity security and harmony.""
Neither man raised their differences in detail in public.
Lopez Obrador brushed off criticism at home to meet Trump, a Republican widely disliked in Mexico because of his incendiary remarks about its people.
Trump described Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug runners during his 2015-16 presidential election campaign and vowed to make Mexico pay for his planned border wall.
In May 2019, Trump threatened tariffs against Mexico to force it to reduce the number of illegal immigrants entering the United States. He only backed off after Lopez Obrador agreed to deploy security forces and other steps to stem the flow of Central American migrants.
The meeting on Wednesday was pitched to mark the July 1 start of United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement that Trump long lambasted.
But the two-day gathering was scaled back to a single day after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau opted out amid new U.S. threats of tariffs on Canadian goods.
Trump said he would speak to Trudeau later and the Canadian would visit at an appropriate time.
Two people familiar with preparations for the meeting said the private sector was eager for Trump to raise concerns about Lopez Obrador's attempts to renegotiate billions of dollars worth of contracts in energy infrastructure.
Lopez Obrador's government is slowly rolling back a 2013-14 opening of the energy industry in favor of a state-led model, and has called a number of major contracts into question.
A senior U.S. official this week said Mexico's government had pledged to uphold those contracts.

Lopez Obrador was joined by a delegation of business officials, including Mexico's richest man, telecoms magnate Carlos Slim, who are to dine on Wednesday evening with Trump and American business executives at the White House.

450,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 04:55PM ET</span>",Furloughs at U.S. legacy airlines could help low-cost carriers like Southwest,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. legacy airlines with lackluster employee demand for early exit packages face large furloughs in the fall, signaling higher post-pandemic labor costs because union contracts require airlines to furlough in reverse order of seniority. 
This could create a competitive boost for budget carriers including Southwest Airlines (N:LUV), whose lower cost structure could help it win market share with cheaper fares, experts said.
Labor will be the biggest single cost for airlines struggling to weather the coronavirus crisis that has crushed air travel demand.
With no quick recovery in sight, United Airlines (O:UAL) said Wednesday it was sending 36,000 furlough warnings to union workers, nearly half its staff, after having received only 3,700 volunteers for early exit deals. Flight attendants are among the hardest hit. 
The union contract requirement to furlough lower-salaried union workers first creates a higher per-seat-mile labor cost and a larger cost gap against low-cost carriers.
""And I imagine ticket prices will flow more or less in line with that,"" said Blake Haxton of Diamond Hill Capital Management analyst, which owns airline shares. 
United flight attendants earn under $30 an hour at the lower end of the pay scale versus nearly $70 an hour at the top end, according to 2016-2021 contractual pay charts reviewed by Reuters.
Low-cost carriers like Southwest have another advantage: Their networks are more focused on domestic leisure travel, where demand is seen recovering first. Legacy carriers, on the other hand, generate more profit from business travel, which remains anemic.
""It's a perfect storm for the legacy carriers,"" Haxton said. 
""GUT-PUNCH"" FURLOUGHS 
United's warning, which one labor leader called a ""gut-punch"" but also an ""honest assessment"" of the state of the industry, is the first indication of the scale of large airlines' job cuts coming Oct. 1. That is when airlines that received a $25 billion federal payroll support package to help protect jobs through September can begin involuntary furloughs. 
Unions have asked lawmakers to extend the payroll aid through March 31. Airlines are not opposed to the idea but are not actively lobbying for it, with little appetite to extend conditions tied to the first package, people familiar with the matter said.
The final number of United furloughs will depend on how demand evolves and how many employees leave voluntarily. The deadline to apply for early exit deals, which offer travel and health benefits but no cash, is July 15.
Exit packages at Southwest, aimed at avoiding its first furloughs in its 49-year history, include buyouts. The deadline is also July 15.
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) is also offering buyouts. American Airlines (O:AAL) is expected to roll out a broader early-exit program for frontline workers soon but has warned it may have 20,000 more staff than needed in the fall. 
Until now, tens of thousands of airline workers have taken temporary unpaid leaves, helped by a $600 weekly federal unemployment supplement that expires this month. That means more employees could return to payroll on Aug. 1 if a push in Washington for a second round of stimulus checks fails.
Furloughs will vary by work group, with airlines seeking to avoid pilot furloughs because of the timely and costly training involved in bringing them back.
It generally takes about one year to re-train 800 pilots, union officials said. If a COVID-19 vaccine is developed and demand bounces back, airlines want to be able to pick up that demand.

United said it was sending about 2,250 furlough warnings to pilots while working with the union to mitigate the final number.

451,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 04:40PM ET</span>","Chubb wants U.S. to offer businesses pandemic cover, with insurers taking some risk","By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - Chubb Ltd (BN:CB) said on Wednesday it is lobbying the U.S. government to insure businesses for losses in future pandemics, while giving the insurance industry a small portion of the business, jumping into a debate over how to insure such disasters. 
The U.S. insurance industry has been largely denying claims for losses caused by coronavirus-driven lockdowns from businesses-interruption policies, saying that pandemics are excluded. 
The denials have led to lawsuits, political pressure and criticism from customers, prompting the industry to start lobbying the government for a plan to cover future pandemics.
As one of the largest U.S. providers of business interruption insurance, Chubb’s views are likely to significantly influence ongoing debate over policy. 
Unlike some in the industry that want the risk to be borne entirely by the government, Chubb wants the industry to play a role in any government-backed insurance plan, Chief Executive Evan Greenberg told Reuters. 
""We believe the industry does have wherewithal to take risk here,"" Greenberg said. He said Chubb is talking to lawmakers, brokers and other insurers about its plan.
Under Chubb’s plan, the government would offer up to $750 billion in coverage for small businesses with up to 500 employees. Of that, the industry would pay for 6% of claims, or up to $15 billion, during the program's first year, growing annually to 12% by year 20. COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, would be excluded.
Small businesses would receive a pre-determined payment based on payroll expenses, which the policy would cover for up to three months.
Chubb's small-business proposal would require all business insurers to participate. Businesses would pay premiums only for the insurers' share of coverage, not the government's, making premiums ""very affordable,"" Greenberg said.
The proposal also includes a program for businesses with more than 500 employees, which would be voluntary for insurers and provide a total of up to $400 billion in coverage through a government reinsurance entity. 
Insurers would share up to $15 billion during the program's first year, rising to $40 billion during its 10th. Payouts to businesses would be limited to $50 million per policy.

452,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 04:22PM ET</span>",Fed officials suggest U.S. recovery may be stalling,"By Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials raised fresh doubts on Wednesday about the durability of the U.S. recovery, while new business surveys highlighted developing risks from the relentless coronavirus pandemic.
In separate appearances, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin noted what Barkin characterized as ""air pockets"" facing the U.S. economy - businesses exhausting existing order books without refilling them, and households facing the end of unemployment benefits and other support.
""Businesses like construction had pretty good pipelines and kept going,"" through the first phase of the pandemic Barkin said in webcast remarks to a group of local chambers of commerce in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley.
But, ""new orders are not coming on line in the same way. We have fiscal payments ... that are coming to an end and it is not clear what is going to replace them."" Enhanced unemployment benefits that have proved key to replacing spendable income amid record setting unemployment are due to expire this month.
Facing that ""fiscal cliff,"" the economy is also grappling with a surge of COVID-19 cases to record levels.
Not all Fed officials are gloomy. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on CNBC he felt that face masks will become ""ubiquitous"" to tame the pandemic, and many lost jobs will be regained by year's end.
But Bullard may be the outlier among his colleagues at the central bank.
""I do expect unfortunately that the economy is going to remain weaker than many had hoped through the summer and fall,"" Rosengren said in a Reuters interview. 
Bostic told the Rotary Club of Columbus, Georgia, he was concerned not so much that states in his southern region had tried to reopen too fast, but without due care about how to manage the riskiest activities.
Caseloads are now surging in places like Florida, and high frequency data on small businesses, for example, ""are suggesting the energy for reopening businesses and for just general activity is starting to level off,"" he said.
The comments from Fed officials, suggesting the seemingly rapid rebound in jobs, retail sales and some other measures of activity in May and June may not persist, were reinforced in two business surveys released on Wednesday.
In the latest quarterly survey of more than 500 company chief financial officers, conducted jointly by the Atlanta and Richmond reserve banks and Duke University, the finance chiefs on average said they were worried about continued weak demand for their products, and expected job recovery to stall for the rest of the year.
Overall optimism among the CFOs did improve compared to the first weeks of the pandemic, though. That is in line with other surveys among households and businesses that suggest people feel the deepest economic risks from the pandemic have been avoided.

A quarterly sentiment index published by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, by contrast, showed community bankers remained deeply pessimistic. The most recent reading was 90, roughly unchanged since the last survey and well below the ""neutral"" reading of 100. The figure was 122 last fall.

453,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 03:54PM ET</span>",Inflation Believers Win Big and Defy the Pandemic Market Panic,"(Bloomberg) -- Mark Nash snapped up inflation-protected bonds in March, when markets were shaken by fears of recession and deflation that left the securities dirt cheap. Now he and other contrarians are reaping the benefits of record gains in the bonds.
Inflation-linked bonds beat nominal peers by the most in at least 22 years last quarter, despite the lack of an acceleration in consumer prices. The performance is owed mainly to investors seeking protection from price pressures that may emerge from stimulus efforts and a return to economic growth. While not all fund managers agree, Nash, head of fixed income at Merian Global Investors, thinks the market will gain further as governments and central banks prop up economies and prevent deflation.
“Buying inflation protection, which was incredibly cheap then, turned out to be a brilliant idea,” said Nash, whose Strategic Absolute Return Bond Fund has beaten 95% of its peers with a year-to-date return of almost 6%.
Inflation-protection trades paid off as the worst-case scenario of deflation was averted. Still, an acceleration in consumer-price increases is widely considered only a remote possibility. Inflation is not a concern in the current economic crisis, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin both said on Tuesday.
The U.S. 10-year breakeven rate, a gauge of market inflation expectation derived from the yield gap between linkers and nominal bonds, has recovered from its 11-year low in March. Yet, at 1.41%, it’s still well below its five-year average and the Fed’s 2% inflation target.
Prior periods of economic stimulus efforts this century were met with predictions of faster inflation that proved to be off the mark. Holders of inflation-linked bonds, whose face value is adjusted to account for the rate of inflation, likely would take losses if that’s the case this time.
Not Convinced
For investors like Elaine Stokes at Loomis Sayles & Co., the prospects for an inflationary rebound are lacking. She’s not detecting any pressure other than what the market has already gleaned from the trough in commodity prices. The labor-market damage from the pandemic is still unfolding, and the lockdown has only entrenched disinflationary trends such as increased power in the hands of consumers, less brick-and-mortar retail, and more renting versus owning.
“The conviction level to be putting a lot of money in inflation-linked securities, we’re struggling with that,” the money manager said. “We’ve seen a lot of money come into the economy back in ‘08-’09 -- it didn’t turn around and give us inflation.”
Praveen Korapaty, chief interest rate strategist at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), suggested investors who gained from inflation-linked bonds should “take some chips off the table” over the next couple of months amid a resurgence of virus infections in the U.S.
“On a tactical basis, perhaps the inflation outperformance takes a bit of a breather until we get more clarity on this,” Korapaty said in an interview. “It looks like consumers and businesses are freaking out again, seeing the surge in cases, so you might see some pullback” in the reflation trend, he said, though he expects the strategy will hold longer term.
Supply Chains, Shortages
Merian’s Nash, whose fund first bought 10-year U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities and then went “long inflation across the board,” is not alone in betting that consumer prices will pick up in the future.
The main argument for higher inflation is that an environment of ultra-loose monetary policy and fiscal spending, commodity shortages, disrupted supply chains and de-globalization is fertile ground for higher consumer prices.
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), which has argued that a supply-chain disruption could push up prices, recently increased its allocations to inflation-linked bonds on a strategic basis while cutting back on nominal bonds. Goldman Sachs favors short-dated linkers. BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management also sees more scope for gains in assets that thrive as consumer-price gains accelerate.
This view is buttressed by hints of a faster-than-expected economic turnaround. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., whose global composite PMI index has rebounded from 26.2 to 47.7 over the last two months, cut its probability for global recession to 10% from 55% three months ago. Money supply and loan growth surged in the U.S. and Europe thanks to central banks offering attractive terms and governments providing guarantees.
Inflation Solution
And with governments borrowing at a record pace to keep their economies afloat through the pandemic, monetary authorities could face pressure to keep interest rates low. Such action could serve the dual purpose of containing the cost of servicing massive amounts of sovereign debt, while at the same time allowing inflation to erode it.
“Debt rollover will become harder when rates rise,” said BlackRock strategists including Elga Bartsch, head of macro research. “It may eventually have to be dealt with through austerity, default or inflation. Inflation could be seen as the most politically palatable solution.”
The flow of money into linkers is clear. Inflation-protected bond funds globally broke records with $2.5 billion of inflows in the week to June 24, according to EPFR.
In exchange-traded funds, Schwab’s TIPS flagship swung from the largest ever outflow to its largest inflow this month -- most likely rebalancing of model portfolios, but still a vote of confidence in recovering price pressures. And this week iShares’s TIPS Bond ETF, the asset class’s largest, hit a record high after its longest advance on record. That said, these six straight quarters of gains have also seen a pickup in withdrawals.
The coronavirus is a wild card that complicates decisions around any investments these days, and inflation bonds are no exception.
A second wave of the pandemic won’t necessarily derail the recovery, according to Colin Harte, a portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management. Experience may help governments and companies manage the situation better. He is looking to add to his long commodity positions as a “sea change” in government policy responses to crises is likely to translate into inflation in the longer term.
“We are in that type of world now where there is a lot of building and reconstruction in the economy after a serious shock, similar to that after the Second World War,” said Harte. “All of that will tend to prove more inflationary than we’ve known in the past 20 plus years.”

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina has no room to improve its latest debt restructuring offer to creditors, Economy Minister Martin Guzman told Reuters on Wednesday, as the country looks to win bondholders over to a deal and avert a messy default and legal standoff.
The South American grains producer unveiled what it said was its ""final"" offer on Sunday to revamp around $65 billion in foreign debt, which drew initial support from some creditors and has helped pump up sovereign bond prices so far this week.
""We made our maximum effort,"" Guzman told Reuters and one other media organization in an interview at his offices in Buenos Aires, adding there was ""clearly not"" any room for amending the offer further.
Despite signals of support for the offer from some quarters, other key bondholder groups, who combined hold significant portions of the eligible debt, have so far held off from backing or rejecting the deal.
That includes the Ad Hoc bondholder group, made up of names like BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Fidelity, which had criticized the government after negotiations stalled in mid-June.
The government's latest offer, which improved payment terms and ceded ground on disputed legal terms, was made without having previously reached an accord with the group.
""With the Ad Hoc group we did not reach an agreement before we launched the offer,"" Guzman said, adding that the government ""have not heard anything yet"" from them.
""We assume that some creditors might take some time to nake their decision.""

(Reuters) - The U.S. economy could recover more slowly than expected from the economic crisis caused by the novel coronavirus, and demand for the Federal Reserve's Main Street lending program, which aims to support small and mid-sized businesses, could grow over time, Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren said on Wednesday. 
Rosengren said the program got off to a quiet start, but he shared a grim outlook in which companies and lenders that initially stayed away from the facility may realize they need more help than expected. 
""There are actually a lot of companies that have been badly disrupted by the pandemic,"" he said in an interview. ""I do expect unfortunately that the economy is going to remain weaker than many had hoped through the summer and fall and this will be an important way to make sure that firms don't close.""
More than 400 lenders have either registered or are in the process of signing up for the program, Rosengren said. No Main Street loans had been completed as of last week, but Rosengren said lenders are starting to receive applications from borrowers across industries, including movie theaters, software companies and oil well servicers. 
The Boston Fed, which is administering the program, published a partial list of participating lenders on Wednesday on its website https://www.bostonfed.org/supervision-and-regulation/supervision/special-facilities/main-street-lending-program/information-for-borrowers.aspx. The central bank also announced this week that it is ready to start purchasing loans from lenders, which will need to hold on to a 5% stake. 

The Fed has made several adjustments to the program after receiving thousands of letters with feedback, including lowering the minimum loan amount, expanding the loan term to five years and introducing a proposal to make loans available for nonprofit groups. Rosengren said the term sheet on the nonprofit loan program should be available within the next week.

The number was higher than the 15.3% rate in May, due largely to a further depreciation of the country's beleaguered bolivar currency, according to opposition lawmaker Jose Guerra. The congress publishes a monthly inflation index due to an absence of regular official data. 
The rise in prices in June brought the interannual inflation rate to 3,524%, the data showed. Socialist President Nicolas Maduro has overseen a six-year economic collapse, prompting poverty to rise to more than 65% of households and compelling 5 million Venezuelans to emigrate.
Maduro blames U.S. sanctions for the South American country's economic woes, but his opponents say that the root causes lie in the government's interventionist policies such as price controls and expropriations of private assets. 
The most recent official central bank data show prices rose 38.6% in May and 27.5% in April. 

Guerra warned that inflation rates would likely increase further in the coming months as producers begin to incorporate the impact of a recent hike in fuel prices into the prices of goods.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday endorsed a plan by President Donald Trump's administration to give employers broad religious and moral exemptions from a federal mandate that health insurance they provide to their workers includes coverage for women's birth control.
The court ruled 7-2 against the states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, which challenged the legality of Trump's 2018 rule weakening the so-called contraceptive mandate of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare. Christian conservatives, a key constituency for Trump as he seeks re-election on Nov. 3, had strongly opposed the Obamacare mandate.
The federal government has estimated that up to 126,000 women could lose contraception coverage through their employer-provided health insurance under Trump's regulation.
The Obamacare mandate requires employer-provided health insurance to give coverage for birth control with no co-pays. Previously, many employer-provided insurance policies did not offer this coverage. Republicans have sought to repeal Obamacare, signed by Trump's Democratic predecessor Barack Obama in 2010, and Trump's administration has chipped away at it through various actions.
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany called the ruling ""a big win for religious freedom and freedom of conscience.""
""Ensuring that women receive the healthcare they need does not require banishing religious groups that refuse to surrender their beliefs from the public square,"" McEnany added.
Trump's rule allows any nonprofit or for-profit employer, including publicly traded companies, to seek an exemption on religious grounds. A moral objection can be made by nonprofits and companies that are not publicly traded. The Trump exemption also would be available for religiously affiliated universities that provide health insurance to students. 
Writing for the court, conservative Justice Clarence Thomas said Trump's administration ""had the statutory authority to craft that exemption, as well as the contemporaneously issued moral exemption.""
Liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented. ""Today, for the first time, the court casts totally aside countervailing rights and interests in its zeal to secure religious rights to the nth degree,"" Ginsburg wrote.
The court's other two liberal justices, Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer, agreed with the outcome but did not did not sign on to Thomas' opinion. Kagan wrote that the regulations could yet be challenged on other grounds, including that the moral exemption is overly broad, which she said is a ""close call.""
Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, pledged to continue the fight against Trump's regulation.
""Our case is about an overly broad rule that allows the personal beliefs of CEOs to dictate women's guaranteed access to contraceptive medicine,"" Shapiro said.
'OVERJOYED'
Rules implemented under Obama exempted religious entities from the mandate. A further accommodation was created for religiously affiliated nonprofit employers, which some groups including the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Roman Catholic order of nuns that was one of the groups seeking an exemption, objected to as not going far enough.
""We are overjoyed that, once again, the Supreme Court has protected our right to serve the elderly without violating our faith,"" said Mother Loraine Marie Maguire of the Little Sisters.
Groups supporting the contraception mandate criticized the decision.
""Today's ruling has given bosses the power to dictate how their employees can and cannot use their health insurance - allowing them to intrude into their employees' private decisions based on whatever personal beliefs their employers happen to hold,"" said Lourdes Rivera of the Center for Reproductive Rights.
The legal question was whether Trump's administration had the legal authority to expand the exemption under both the Obamacare law itself and another federal law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which lets people press religious claims against the federal government.
The administration was joined in the litigation by a Pittsburgh affiliate of the Little Sisters. Under a separate court ruling, the group already had an exemption to the mandate.
Thomas wrote that the Little Sisters ""have had to fight for the ability to continue in their noble work without violating their sincerely held religious beliefs"" and that Trump's rule resolves their concerns.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday sided with Catholic schools in a separate legal dispute with teachers who said they were unlawfully dismissed, ruling that religious institutions like churches and schools are shielded from employment discrimination lawsuits.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines (O:UAL) said on Wednesday it was preparing to send notices of potential furloughs to 36,000 U.S.-based frontline employees, or about 45% of staff, as travel demand hit by the coronavirus pandemic struggles to recover.
United shares lost 3.3% in midday trading.
Not everyone who receives a notification will be furloughed, United said, with the final number depending on how demand evolves and how many employees accept early exit packages and temporary leaves.
The furloughs would begin on Oct. 1, when a government-imposed ban on forced job cuts by airlines that accepted billions of dollars in federal payroll aid expires.
""The United Airlines projected furlough numbers are a gut punch, but they are also the most honest assessment we've seen on the state of the industry,"" Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA) President Sara Nelson said in a statement.
The Chicago-based airline continues to burn through about $40 million of cash every day, with a number of efforts to cut costs and raise liquidity failing to compensate for the drastic drop-off in travel demand as COVID-19 cases continue to rise in the United States.
The furlough warnings vary by work group. Flight attendants are among the hardest hit, with about 15,000 of roughly 25,000 set to receive notifications.
United is working with the different unions on options to mitigate the final furlough number.
Flight attendants, for example, have been offered two voluntary furlough options, one lasting eight months through June 1, 2021, and another lasting 13 months through Nov, 1 2021, during which they would maintain benefits, according to a memo reviewed by Reuters.

""But the fact remains that these projected furlough numbers are larger than the total size of most mainline airlines a decade ago,"" AFA's Nelson said, referring to the number of employees major airlines had before mergers.

LONDON (Reuters) - Gold pushed above $1,800 an ounce on Wednesday for the first time since 2011, with analysts expecting further gains as investors stock up on an asset they expect to hold its value while the coronavirus convulses the global economy.
Spot gold prices have surged 40% in the last 14 months and are within striking distance of 2011's record high of $1,920.30 an ounce.
""We'll be challenging the $2,000 level by the end of the year,"" said Ross Norman, an independent analyst. ""We are in a bull market for gold."" 
(Graphic: Gold's latest rally, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/jznpnzmokpl/GR%20RALLY.JPG) 
Powering the rally is economic and political uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and action by central banks, which have responded to slowing growth and the virus by slashing interest rates and flooding markets with cash.
This has fuelled fears of inflation, which would typically devalue other assets, and has also lowered returns on government bonds, making gold more attractive.
Gold's rise has been mirrored by a slide in real yields on 10-year U.S. bonds, which at around minus 0.8% are near record lows.
(Graphic: Gold vs real U.S. yields, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/ygdvzwaempw/GR%20YIELDS.JPG) 
Financial investors, mainly in Europe and the United States, have been on an unprecedented buying spree. 
Exchange-traded funds storing gold on behalf of these investors added 734 tonnes of gold worth $39.5 billion to their stockpile in first half of the year – more than in any previous full year and nearly half of all the gold mined during the period, according to the World Gold Council.
""Western investment has been the key factor supporting prices (and) there's no reason for that to stop,"" said StoneX analyst Rhona O'Connell. 
(Graphic: Gold ETFs vs prices, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gjnvwwrzjvw/GR%20ETFS.JPG) 
This surge in purchases has offset a collapse in demand for gold in China and India, traditionally the largest buyers, where the bulk of gold is sold as jewellery.

A recovery in economic growth could lift jewellery sales but also cause investors to buy less, pushing prices lower, said Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke. 

HSBC said in a note it expected gold to average $1,743 an ounce this year but to fall to about $1,500 in the coming years.

461,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 11:26AM ET</span>",Trump administration says pandemic aid saved 51 million jobs. Did it?,"By Michelle Price and Brad Heath
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration touted its $660 billion small business pandemic aid program this week as a ""wild success,"" unveiling data that showed the initiative saved 51 million jobs.
But there were red flags throughout the colossal data set that suggested some borrowers overstated how many jobs their loan salvaged. That, combined with several of the named companies disputing that they took a loan after the government showed otherwise, cast doubt on the accuracy of the 51 million figure.
For example, a Reuters analysis of the data found that 827 companies reported saving at least 400 jobs with a loan smaller than $150,000. Two hundred of those companies reported saving at least 400 jobs with a loan of just $5,000 or less.
""I'm skeptical of the total number,"" said Philip Mattera, a director at Washington-based non-profit Good Jobs First, which focuses on government accountability. 
""My guess is there wasn't much rigor that went into the reporting of these jobs figures."" 
A senior administration official said the 51 million figure was an estimate based on the preliminary lender data and that the actual number of jobs saved will be clearer once borrowers have gone through the process of having the loans forgiven.
The Paycheck Protection Program, overseen by the Small Business Administration (SBA), allows small businesses with 500 or fewer employees hurt by the economic fallout of the pandemic to apply for a forgivable government-backed loan. Monday's data provided details on nearly 4.9 million loans, including the number of jobs the borrower said the loan helped them retain.
That data - released jointly by the SBA and the U.S. Treasury Department on Monday - is critical in assessing the success of the program, which Congress created to keep workers on the payroll. 
In a bid to get cash out the door quickly, the Treasury and the SBA agreed that borrowers need only to certify in good faith that the information they supplied to lenders and the SBA was accurate. 
Except for a limited documentation review, the job retention figures were not thoroughly vetted, according to interviews with bankers and lawyers who have direct knowledge of the process.
Speaking to reporters on Monday, senior administration officials were at pains to point out that the onus was on the borrower to provide accurate information. 
Mattera said one ""telltale"" sign that some borrowers may have fudged the figures was the 3,728 companies which reported that they retained exactly 500 employees.
As companies were not compelled to provide job retention estimates to apply for the loan, 878,000 companies either reported that no jobs were retained or did not provide a number, a Reuters analysis found. That's roughly 18% of all loans.
And Monday's data only covers loans that have been approved, not loans that have been disbursed, so it is unclear how much cash has actually made its way into borrowers' pockets. 
Reuters and other media outlets have also identified several borrowers listed in the data, including scooter company Bird Rides Inc. and New York-based Advent Capital Management LLC, which dispute that they applied for or received a PPP loan.
Bird Rides CEO Travis VanderZanden Tweeted on Monday that his company had discussed getting a loan with its bank, but decided against it. Likewise, Advent told Reuters it explored seeking a loan but never completed an application. But in the data, their loans are listed as having saved 395 jobs combined. 
Those discrepancies suggest the data contains phantom loans - loans which were approved by the SBA but which were neither disbursed nor canceled by the lender, leaving them to linger in the SBA system, according to people familiar with the process.

""When you have a list this large there are going to be quite a few errors in it,"" Mattera said.

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's emergency lending facilities helped stabilize markets after anxiety over the coronavirus sparked volatility in March, and the central bank stands ready to adjust its approach if necessary, a senior official at the New York Fed said on Wednesday. 
While some of the programs the Fed set up to help keep credit flowing to households and businesses had low usage, the backstops still helped to improve market functioning, said Daleep Singh, head of the markets group at the New York Fed.
A high level of uncertainty over the outlook means that the central bank needs to stay vigilant, he said in prepared remarks.
""We need to be watchful of banking sector resilience in the face of potential waves of nonperforming loans and bankruptcies that could challenge asset quality,"" Singh said. ""All of this is to remind us of what we already know: there remains tremendous uncertainty about the path ahead, and so we must stay humble in the face of ongoing risks and resolute in our commitment to adapt as needed.""
The Fed is adjusting its approach as market conditions change, Singh said. For example, the pace of purchases through the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility has slowed to $200 million a day from $300 million daily and could be reduced further, he said. 
""If market conditions continue to improve, Fed purchases could slow further, potentially reaching very low levels or stopping entirely,"" Singh said, adding that would not mean an end to the program. ""Should conditions deteriorate, purchases would increase.""
However, the Fed is limited in the ways it can support the economy, he said.
""We’re not authorized to grant money to particular firms or households, we can only make loans,"" Singh said during a moderated discussion. ""There will be entities that need direct fiscal support.""

463,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 11:01AM ET</span>",UK's Sunak pledges 30 billion pounds to stem unemployment crisis,"By Andy Bruce and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's finance minister promised an additional 30 billion pounds ($38 billion) to head off an unemployment crisis on Wednesday, funnelling money to employers, homebuyers and beleaguered hospitality firms to drive a recovery. 
Rishi Sunak, who was already on course to take state borrowing to World War Two levels with 133 billion pounds of initial coronavirus emergency measures, said he would return the public finances to a sustainable footing over the medium term.
But the former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst promised to press on with using the power of the state to shore up the economy, which has forced his Conservative Party to suspend its traditional pro-market instincts.
""I want every person in this House and in the country to know that I will never accept unemployment as an unavoidable outcome,"" Sunak told parliament on Wednesday.
The world's sixth-biggest economy shrank by 25% in March and April and could be heading for its biggest fall in 300 years in 2020, with the unemployment rate on course to more than double to about 10%, according to official projections.
Under a new bonus plan, employers will be paid 1,000 pounds ($1,256) after the furlough scheme expires at the end of October for every worker who returns to their job, provided they are kept on through to the end of January.
With more than 9 million jobs covered by the scheme, the cost of the bonuses could be as much as 9.4 billion pounds.
To help hospitality and tourism, hampered by social distancing rules, Sunak announced a cut in value-added tax for the sector to 5% from 20% for six months.
People eating out in August between Monday and Wednesday will receive a 50% discount of up to 10 pounds each, paid for by the government.
Shares in pubs and restaurant firms rose.
With close to 45,000 confirmed coronavirus-linked deaths, Britain has been hit harder by the pandemic than any other European country, leaving many people reluctant to return to life as before. 
FOCUS ON YOUNG WORKERS
Sunak's plan includes a 2 billion pound ($2.5 billion) fund to create six-month work placement jobs for unemployed 16-24 year-olds and more government-funded apprenticeships.
A further 3 billion pounds will be spent on improving the energy efficiency of homes and public buildings, which would support more than 100,000 jobs.
The 30 billion pound cost of the plan includes around 5.6 billion pounds in accelerated infrastructure spending announced last week by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Some employers had urged Sunak to go further by cutting the social security contributions they must pay for their workers.
In a bid to breathe life into the housing market and the broader economy, Sunak raised the lower threshold for a tax on property purchases to 500,000 pounds, four times its current level, with immediate effect until March 31.
Economists said the plan was unlikely to accelerate Britain's recovery from the crisis.
""Overall this wasn't a massive fiscal package, with other countries like Germany announcing much larger fiscal packages,"" Jing Teow, an economist at PwC, said.
As well the uncertainties about how the pandemic will proceed, Sunak has to contend with the possibility London and Brussels fail to agree a post-Brexit trade deal by the end of this year.
""The chancellor is likely keeping his powder dry until the autumn,"" Teow said, referring to a formal budget statement Sunak is due to deliver in late 2020.

465,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 10:54AM ET</span>",U.S. Consumption May See Quick Pickup If Lockdown Is Short-Lived,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer spending may experience a strong bounceback thanks to the government’s $1,200 stimulus checks and unemployment funds, according to a European Central Bank working paper.
That optimistic scenario assumes shutdowns don’t last longer than two quarters, authors Christopher Carroll, Edmund Crawley, Jiri Slacalek and Matthew White wrote in a piece published on Wednesday. Longer lasting closures would have a far more damaging effect and necessitate an extension of the stimulus. But a longer-lasting lockdown would be more damaging and would require an extension of the stimulus.
“We estimate that the combination of expanded unemployment insurance benefits and stimulus payments should be sufficient to allow a swift recovery in consumer spending to its pre-crisis levels,” they wrote. However, if the shutdown lasts for a year and the unemployment rate hits 20%, “we find that the return of spending toward its no-pandemic path takes roughly three years.”
Although recent U.S. data has proved better than expected, Atlanta Federal Reserve chief Raphael Bostic earlier this week cautioned that the renewed spread of Covid-19 may threaten the pace of the U.S. recovery, as businesses and consumers put plans on hold.
The U.S. Congress is debating more stimulus measures, which the White House is pushing for before the lawmakers’ August recess. The $600 weekly in additional unemployment benefits that were passed as part of the March $2 trillion CARES Act are set to expire at the end of the month.
The paper published by the ECB said that while people who kept their jobs increased their savings, CARES Act stimulus meant consumption of those who lost their jobs recovered a year faster than it otherwise would have. As for those with little hope of reclaiming employment, the marginal propensity to consumer is lower because they’re bracing for a longer time without money.
In fact, the authors argue they may even be underestimating the scope of bounceback. For technical reasons, their model doesn’t include purchases of durable goods.
“It is plausible that, when the lockdown ends, people may want to spend more than usual on memorable or durable goods to make up for earlier missing spending,” they said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The biggest uncertainty now facing insurers is whether they will have to pay for a raft of business interruption claims, the Bank of England said, as a court prepares to rule on whether existing policies cover big losses caused by the coronavirus crisis.
Anna Sweeney, the BoE's executive director for insurance, said the sector has remained robust in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on assets they hold and on liabilities.
""The highest level of uncertainty remains around business interruption,"" she told a City & Financial online event.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority goes to court this month to clarify whether an array of wordings in business interruption insurance policies back claims for compensation for disruptions caused by pandemic lockdowns. 
""A number of insurers are taking steps to make sure there is no ambiguity about who is and isn't covered for a second wave,"" Sweeney said.
 Hiscox  (L:HSX) is among eight insurers whose policy wordings will come under scrutiny by the courts this month, although the trial could still go to an appeal.
""We would expect both sides to abide by the outcome,"" Hiscox Chief Executive Bronek Masojada said.
Lloyd's of London Chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown said insurers should consider whether their products were correctly labelled and said brokers had a responsibility to provide clear advice on what is covered.
Association of British Insurers Director General Huw Evans said the industry would be undertaking a ""wholesale review of wordings"" as a result of the disputes. 
Businesses have been struggling to get pandemic cover, with Lloyd's calling for state-backed policies for pandemics and other systemic risks.
Reinsurers have said they will exclude communicable disease cover from all policies from Jan. 1, Masojada said.
Asked if insurers should bolster capital buffers, Sweeney said her ""personal instinct"" was that the emphasis should be on being clear on what liabilities were covered and managing those risks.

Britain left the EU in January and is currently in a standstill transition period with the bloc to give the two sides time to fix a new relationship in everything from trade to security.
""Progress in negotiations thus far has been slim, to put it diplomatically,"" Merkel told the European Parliament as Germany assumed the EU's rotating presidency for the rest of the year. 
""We have agreed with the UK to accelerate the pace of the talks ... I will continue to push for a good solution, but we should also prepare for a possibility of a no-deal scenario.""
Britain has so far rejected EU pressure to commit to close ties in areas ranging from fisheries to harmonising competition standards - a 'level playing field' - since Prime Minister Boris Johnson - a key campaigner for Brexit - wants only a narrower trade deal. 
British and EU officials meet in London this week for more talks. The bloc's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said the 27 members of the union will not seek a deal at any price.
Barnier had dinner with Johnson in London on Tuesday evening. On Wednesday, he said: ""We are working hard for a fair agreement with the United Kingdom, including on fisheries and a 'level playing field'.""
The two elements are among the points that have blocked an agreement so far in talks between the world's largest trading bloc and its fifth-biggest economy. Should no deal emerge, major trade and travel disruptions would ensue.
Johnson said in a call with Merkel on Tuesday evening that Britain would leave the transition period at the end of the year ""on Australia terms"" if no better deal was agreed.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said on Wednesday it is expanding a program to supply repair parts, tools and manuals for iPhones to independent repair shops in 32 countries in Europe as well as Canada.
Apple began the program last year in the United States after years of lobbying against state-level ""right to repair"" bills that would have compelled it to provide parts to independent shops.
Apple has long maintained a network of authorized service providers such as  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) to perform warranty work, but smaller shops had complained that the program was too costly to join because of high volume commitments, leaving them without access to genuine Apple parts or the software tools needed to perform some repairs.
Apple launched its program for those independent shops last August, making it free to join if technicians complete a training program. Apple said Wednesday that 140 businesses with 700 locations have signed up for the program in the United States. Some of the independent shops, such as uBreakiFix, have multiple locations, while some are sole proprietorships.
""When a customer needs a repair, we want them to have a range of options that not only suits their needs but also guarantees safety and quality so their iPhone can be used for as long as possible,"" Jeff Williams (NYSE:WMB), Apple's chief operating officer, said in a statement.
Under the program, independent shops get access to Apple parts and tools to perform out-of-warranty repairs. They also get Apple parts at the same prices as authorized service centers and can still also use third-party after-market parts and set their own prices. The program only covers iPhones. 

Independent shops must inform customers whether they are using genuine Apple parts and send any salvaged Apple parts back to the company, where they are either refurbished or recycled. Apple said it is also creating an online tool to verify whether an independent shop participates in its program.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's future access to the European Union financial market must take into account how far it will diverge from the bloc's rules, a European Commission official said on Wednesday.
After leaving the EU in January, Britain retains full access to the bloc until the end of 2020 under a transition deal with its former partners, with both blaming each other for missing an end of June deadline for assessments on access from 2021. 
Future access will depend on Brussels deciding that Britain's financial rules are and likely to remain equivalent to or sufficiently aligned with those in the bloc.
""We need to have a forward-looking approach and have a good understanding of the intentions the UK has in terms of future financial regulation,"" Andrea Beltramello told an online event organised by the Futures Industry Association, an industry body.
The London Stock Exchange's London Clearing House clears more than 90% of euro-denominated interest rate swaps and said it needs certainty on EU access by September to avoid a ""cliff-edge"" that forces customers to move positions out of Britain by December, potentially undermining market stability.
Beltramello said Brussels would not wait until the last minute to make its intentions known, but that markets should prepare for all possible outcomes.
""We are very mindful of the situation and we will take the steps that are necessary to deal with financial stability risks,"" Beltramello said.
Julien Jardelot, the LSE's head of Europe government relations and regulator strategy, said he hopes the EU can give some form of legal clarity shortly.
""We are confident that both EU and UK regulators... understand the need to ensure a smooth transition,"" Jardelot said.

The European Central Bank wants euro clearing moved from London to the euro zone, but Jardelot said there was ""no discernible"" movement to Eurex (DE:DB1Gn) in Frankfurt because clients don't want market fragmentation.

""We are especially concerned that the crisis will jeopardise the important development gains of the last years,"" she added.

The IMF last month forecast a deeper global recession than initially anticipated. It now anticipates a global GDP contraction of 4.9% this year and a total output loss of $12 trillion through the end of 2021.

478,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 06:46AM ET</span>",Coronavirus 'collateral damage' hits U.S. rural power providers,"By Nick Carey
CROPSEY, Ill. (Reuters) - When the coronavirus pandemic left Ron Mueller without a market for the 3,200 piglets his hog breeding operation cranks out weekly and facing huge bills, his local electricity provider offered to cut the Illinois farmer some slack. 
Eastern Illini Electric Cooperative (EIEC), which powers Mueller's farm and serves farmers, small businesses and residents across 10 rural counties, was willing to delay his bills as he scrambled to make ends meet. 
""I want to pay my bills,"" said Mueller, who had been forced to euthanize nearly 5,000 piglets in late March but still refused EIEC's offer. ""If I can't afford to feed them (the pigs), I'll just quit feeding them.""
Others in the area have been unable to avoid falling behind. From March to April, EIEC's number of 90-day past-due accounts jumped by 50%.
Mueller’s dire choice between his pigs and paying the bills shows the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on rural areas of America like Cropsey in central Illinois, which in general have been less hard hit by cases of the highly contagious coronavirus than metropolitan areas. 
Electric cooperatives, which serve about 42 million rural Americans, are a window of sorts into the far-reaching effects of the pandemic. Revenues of the cooperatives have taken a hit as the outbreak has curbed demand from commercial users and left many workers unemployed and unable to pay their bills. 
Farmers like Mueller were hit as restaurants and schools shut down and demand for milk, bacon and pork fell. Exports dried up and meatpacking plants closed, with major facilities now running at about 75% capacity.
Oil prices plunged, so Midwestern ethanol production crashed. 
Unemployment rates in largely rural states are lower than the national average but have risen rapidly. For instance, Oklahoma's unemployment rate of 12.6% in May was lower than the national rate of 13.3%, but still a huge shift from the state's 3.2% jobless rate in February.
""What we're seeing here is the collateral damage,"" said Jeff Hohn, chief executive officer of Kenergy Corp, an electric cooperative that serves 14 rural counties in northwestern Kentucky where manufacturing plants including paper mills and auto suppliers have been hit by shutdowns. ""The concern here is whether some of those businesses will come back.""
Kenergy and other not-for-profit electric cooperatives serve rural areas that have already been buffeted by President Donald Trump's trade wars. 
""With the trade wars, our ag community has really endured some hard times the last few years,"" said Rick Olesen, CEO of the Iowa Lakes Electric Cooperative (ILEC) in northern Iowa that serves farmers and three large ethanol plants that shut down as fuel demand collapsed. One of those plants has since reopened, but ILEC is projecting a 15% drop in revenue this year.
The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) estimates its members will suffer a revenue shortfall of $10 billion through 2021. 
That matters because the electric cooperatives have high fixed costs serving far fewer customers per mile than for-profit utilities in cities and suburbs.
The NRECA has lobbied the U.S. Congress to adopt legislation allowing cooperatives to refinance government loans at lower interest rates to ease the pain. A bill was introduced in the House and Senate on July 2 that would do just that.
Association President Jim Matheson says the bill, if passed, could save the average cooperative $2 million in annual interest payments. Otherwise cooperatives might be forced to raise electricity rates to pay their bills.
""They (Congress) understand the challenges we face,"" he said. ""They are giving us a sympathetic ear, but it's hard to get anything through Congress these days."" 
'AT WHAT PRICE?
EIEC customer Jim Niewold said the pandemic has impacted every single market for the corn and soybeans he grows on around 2,100 acres of land in Loda, Illinois, and many farmers are stuck sitting on last year's crop. 
""The question is where are we going to put this year's crop if something doesn't change?"" he said. ""Eventually I'm sure we'll get rid of all of our product – but at what price?""
Niewold, 65, has low debts and says he should be able to weather the crisis, but he and EIEC's CEO, Bob Hunzinger, both worry about the impact on younger farmers still paying off loans for land or equipment. 
Hunzinger is also concerned this may further erode the local rural population.
""You'll see farmhouses around here that have been lived in for over 100 years,"" he said. ""But next year, they might be empty.""
Jennifer Meason, CEO of electric cooperative Cotton Electric, which serves eight rural counties in southwestern Oklahoma, says many of the people her cooperative serves have been laid off from the oil and gas industry. 
    Overdue accounts, which normally average a combined $30,000, spiked to $240,000 in the spring before unemployment benefits started to trickle in, she said.
Cotton Electric also serves oil and gas producers and Meason estimates sales could fall nearly 10% this year.
""We're still wondering whether it's going to be just a few months or will it be into 2021 before some oil producers get close to normal production,"" she said. 
At Kenergy in northwestern Kentucky, electricity sales have been down nearly $5 million, or 15%, per month. 
CEO Hohn said unless the cooperative is able to refinance its federal loans to lower costs, he will face a hard choice.
""If things stay like this, we will have to go for a rate increase,"" he said. ""Not this year, but probably next year.""
He hopes Congress will take action so he can refinance his loans, but worries the cooperatives may not get heard in the midst of a national crisis. 
""There's only so much money to go around and everyone's in line right now,"" Hohn said.

The General Court said the ECB was right to sanction the French bank for failing to gain approval before classifying capital instruments as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) but gave inadequate reasons for how it arrived at the penalty.
The ECB fined the bank along with Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, and CA Consumer Finance for a combined 4.9 million euros ($5.52 million), a sum that was annulled in Wednesday's ruling in a case brought by  Credit Agricole  (OTC:CRARY) and several subsidiaries.
""The contested decisions do not provide details of the methodology applied by the ECB in determining the amount of the penalties imposed,"" the Court said, adding that the bank had a right to receive a sufficient statement of reasons for the decision at issue.
But the court also made clear that Crédit Agricole was required to obtain permission from its supervisor before classifying its capital instruments as CET 1 and it should have understood this legal provision so it committed negligence.
""The Court finds that the applicants have not demonstrated that the ECB’s decisions were unlawful,"" the General Court said.
In challenging the fine, Crédit Agricole had argued that the ECB did not have to give prior approval to its move to classify ordinary shares as Tier 1 capital but even if it did, its error was so minor, the fine was disproportionate.
Although many ECB decisions are challenged in court, the euro zone's central bank wins most of them, including the landmark challenges to its bond purchase programmes, key planks in monetary policy.

Investing.com --  Reports of fresh U.S. action against China over Hong Kong hits HSBC but not the Hang Seng or the HK dollar. U.S. coronavirus cases topped 60,000 for the first time on Tuesday as President Trump leaned on schools to reopen in the fall. Stocks are set to open mixed after Tuesday's losses on fears that a second wave could cap the economic rebound. Allstate (NYSE:ALL) is to buy National General insurance for $4 billion. Spot gold prices top $1,800 for the first time since 2011 and the U.K. announces another round of fiscal stimulus. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, July 8th.
1. Hong Kong reports hit HSBC but not the $HKD
The U.S. is looking at further ways to punish China for its perceived violation of Hong Kong’s autonomy with a new national security law that greatly expands the powers of mainland security organs in the former British colony.
Bloomberg reported that aides to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are looking at ways to undermine the Hong Kong dollar’s peg to its U.S. counterpart, but the agency reported that concerns about the potential market instability it would trigger are a powerful disincentive.
 HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) shares fell by the most in more than two months amid concerns that the U.S. could limit the access of Hong Kong banks to dollars. HSBC gets more than two-thirds of its profits from Hong Kong and the adjoining Pearl River Delta. The Hong Kong dollar was stable, however, and the Hang Seng stock index rose another 0.6%.
2. U.S. virus cases hit new record high
The U.S. posted over 60,000 new cases of Covid-19 for the first time, with the state of Texas accounting for over 10,000 of them.
The World Health Organization’s executive director Mike Ryan said that it wouldn’t be surprising if  the global death count starts to rise again, given the virus’ spread not just in the U.S., but also in countries such as Latin America and India.
San Francisco delayed the restart of indoor dining on Tuesday, while Ohio introduced a mask requirement in the counties covering Cleveland and Cincinnati.
President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he would pressure primary and secondary schools in the fall, which would have the consequence of allowing more parents to return to work. The federal government hasn’t issued any guidance on how to ensure schools can be reopened safely yet.
3. Stocks set to open mixed; Allstate to buy National General
U.S. stocks are set to open flat to lower after breaking a five-day winning streak on Tuesday over concerns that the spread of the coronavirus will crimp the economic rebound.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 33 points or 0.1%, while S&P 500 Futures were down less than 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.2%.
European stocks were also mostly lower but Chinese indices continued to rise.
Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) will report fiscal first-quarter results after the closing bell. Also in the spotlight will be insurance giant Allstate (NYSE:ALL), which has agreed to buy rival National General (NASDAQ:NGHC) for $4 billion in cash. 
4. Gold hits nine-year high
The spot price for gold bullion rose above $1,800 for the first time in nearly nine years as fears of a second wave of the pandemic and expectations of easy central bank policy continued to drive flows into perceived safe haven assets.
According to the World Gold Council, gold-backed ETFs had record net inflow of $40 billion in the firs half of 2020. In June alone, they added 104 tons of gold, taking global holdings to all-time highs of 3,621 tons.
Federal Reserve Richard Clarida and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly stressed that the Fed still has options to increase monetary stimulus in appearances on Tuesday, lending credibility to expectations of what  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts called “incessant” Fed support.
Elsewhere, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde indicated in an interview that the ECB could be on hold for some time after nearly doubling the size of its pandemic-focused bond-buying program.
5. U.K. to announce more stimulus
The U.K. government is expected to announce further fiscal stimulus measures in a ‘mini-budget’ from Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak.
The measures expected to be announce include 3 billion pounds for improving the energy efficiency of homes and commercial property, 1.5 billion for supporting the arts and entertainment industry, and 2 billion pounds in wage subsidies for the young.  There have also been reports that transaction taxes levied on home purchases will be partially suspended in an effort to revive the U.K.’s housing market.
The announcement comes a day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson told German Chancellor Angela Merkel that the U.K. was prepared to accept a ‘no deal’ scenario on trade with the EU at the end of the current post-Brexit transition period at the end of the year.  The pound was down 0.1% at $1.2525 and 1.1113 euros.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is eyeing issuing longer-term debt to take advantage of low interest rates, and expects servicing costs to be lower this fiscal year than was forecast last year despite the billions in emergency spending due to COVID-19, a government source said. 
Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau will deliver a ""fiscal snapshot"" on Wednesday that will outline the current balance sheet and growth expectations.
In December, Canada said it expected public debt charges to be C$23.7 billion ($17.4 billion) in the 2020-21 fiscal year starting on April 1. But a government source said the new estimate would be lower despite a much higher deficit than had been expected.
Canada's independent Parliamentary Budget Officer said the federal deficit was likely to balloon to C$256 billion ($188 billion) in 2020-21, mainly because of the spending meant to soften the blow of pandemic shutdowns, compared with a 2019-20 deficit of C$21.8 billion reported in May.
The Globe and Mail, citing two senior government officials, reported that Morneau on Wednesday would forecast a deficit of more than C$300 billion.
The Bank of Canada slashed its benchmark rate in March by a total of 1.5 percentage points to 0.25%. It has said it does not intend to reduce rates any further.
Canada lost one of its coveted triple-A ratings in June when Fitch downgraded it for the first time, citing the billions of dollars in emergency aid Ottawa has spent to help bridge the downturn caused by COVID-19 shutdowns.
Standard & Poor's, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and DBRS still give Canadian debt the highest rating. 
Issuing longer-tenure debt ""makes a whole lot of sense,"" said Brett House, deputy chief economist at Scotiabank. 
""It's an excellent idea to tilt more of the issuance towards longer-term borrowing and ... I do think there's still appetite,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. ""So I would heavily encourage them to take advantage of these exceptionally low long-term yields.""

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said the data confirmed economists and tax experts long-held suspicions that multinationals were legally exploiting loopholes in international tax rules to park profits in low tax jurisdictions.
Multinationals with group revenues of at least $750 million have been required since 2016 to report income, profit and taxes for the countries in which they operate under an under an international push to shed light on the issue led by the OECD.
First insights from the trove of anonymised and aggregated data reveal a ""misalignment between the location where profits are reported and the location where economic activities occur"", the OECD said.
On average multinationals' operations in investment hubs report 25% of group profits but only 4% of employees and 11% of tangible assets.
The median value of revenue per employee in jurisdictions with no corporate income tax was $1.4 million, the report said.
Meanwhile, the same value in places where corporate income is taxed at less than 20% was $240,000 and $370,000 where the tax rate is more than 20%.
The OECD said the findings made it all the more important to complete negotiations among nearly 140 countries on a global minimum corporate tax rate, which are due to be wrapped up this year.

The survey for the German Chambers of Commerce showed the devastation wrought by the epidemic on Europe's largest economy, with 15% of the roughly 3,300 companies surveyed reporting a halving of their annual turnover.
But the focus of the impact was shifting: whereas lockdown-related travel restrictions had a major impact on sectors including tourism and industry earlier on, now companies were increasingly feeling the impact via slackening demand.
In July 59% of respondents complained of ailing demand for their products and services, up from 57% in April. Teething troubles like supply bottlenecks and production stops had become less of an issue, however.

The impact of the virus was also being felt in firms' dwindling eagerness to invest: in July, more than half of firms were planning to invest less abroad, compared with only 35% in April.

Thailand partially lifted a three-month ban on foreign visitors this month and had been planning to further boost tourism, a key contributor to its economy, by creating travel bubbles later in the year with countries like Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong that had managed to contain the virus.
But fresh outbreaks are creating uncertainty, Tourism Authority of Thailand Governor Yuthasak Supasorn said.
""The travel bubble that was going to begin in the fourth quarter could be delayed,"" he added. The government had previously said the travel bubble could begin in September.
""We adjusted our forecast for foreign arrivals this year to 8.2 million from 10-12 million,"" Yuthasak said. 
Thailand recorded 6.7 million foreign arrivals in the first five months and is allowing business travelers and tourists seeking medical treatment to enter for the rest of the year. 
The government this month will roll out a $722 million domestic tourism stimulus to boost revenue.
Tourism, mainly international visitors, is crucial to Thailand's economy. A record 39.8 million foreign tourists visited the country last year and spent 1.93 trillion baht, accounting for 11% of its GDP.

Thailand on Wednesday marked 44 days without a local transmission. It has reported total 3,197 virus infections, with Thai nationals returning from overseas accounting for new cases.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A hard lockdown in Australia's second-largest city will likely erase nearly A$5 billion of economic output over six weeks, slowing a broader national recovery and forcing the government to expand its already massive debt-funded stimulus.
Australia has been among the most successful countries in curbing the spread of the coronavirus but the lockdown in the state of Victoria and its capital Melbourne has hurt hopes of a faster and sharper economic recovery.
""Our initial sense is that the re-opening reversal stemming from the lockdown will see the economy surrender some - but not all - of the better than expected trajectory,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) economist Phil Odanaghoe wrote in a note.
Crucially, the shutdown will close cross-border trade and movement between Victoria and New South Wales, which collectively account for more than half of Australia's economy and population.
The two states, which are separated by the Murray River and its lucrative farming districts, had previously remained open to each other even as other states closed their domestic borders.
In 2019, the air passenger route between the state capitals of Sydney and Melbourne was the second-busiest in the world, according to industry analytics group OAG.
Westpac downgraded its forecasts for growth in Australia's A$2 trillion economy to 4.2% contraction in 2020 from 4% previously.
Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said ""the events in Melbourne highlight the risks to this scenario around the containment of the virus; other shutdowns; and the inevitable savage loss in confidence were that to occur.""
To be sure, other states and territories are sticking to their planned re-openings, with Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory set to re-open their borders this month to each other and to New South Wales, the country's largest state economy.
That would be positive for domestic tourism, retail spending and business supply chain management.
Still, the Melbourne lockdown means Prime Minister Scott Morrison's conservative government could face a larger stimulus bill.
Morrison has repeatedly said the temporary measures that is set to cost his government about A$160 billion($111 billion), or 8% of GDP, will end in September.
However, he now faces increasing pressure to extend this support, which includes household income relief and provisions for workers to unlock some of their pension funds.
Citi economist Josh Williamson expects demand for these programmes to increase.
The government will publish a ""mini-budget statement"" on July 23, providing some clarity on what measures would continue and in what form.
Policymakers are also bracing for a hit to confidence in other parts of the country from the Melbourne lockdown. 
""Outside of the localised economic impact, the Melbourne lockdown could hit consumer and business confidence outside of Victoria,"" Williamson said.
""Any dent to confidence is a risk for the pace at which the hard data returns to normal and is worth watching.""

Speaking in an interview with Financial Times published on Wednesday, the ECB president said that measures unleashed in the wake of the pandemic have “demonstrated their efficiency, their effectiveness.” The Governing Council’s next decision is in just over a week, its first since it almost doubled the size of its pandemic purchase program to 1.35 trillion euro ($1.52 trillion).
“We have done so much that we have quite a bit of time to assess” economic data “carefully,” Lagarde told the newspaper.
Her comments confirm the ECB has effectively switched to a wait-and-see mode after the economy began to bounce back. Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel said on Tuesday the recession could turn out somewhat milder than expected.
Lagarde also told the newspaper her institution wants to “explore every avenue available in order to combat climate change,” which could include examining “greener” changes to all of the central bank’s operations, including asset purchases.

491,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 11:45PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer watchdog removes 'ability-to-pay' need from final payday loan rule,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Tuesday issued its long-awaited payday lending measure that rescinds an Obama-era proposal requiring lenders first ensure a borrower is able to repay them.
Consumer advocates blasted the move as a further sign the Trump administration is going easy on predatory lenders.
The rule follows the agency's 2019 proposal to seek fresh recommendations on whether to implement the so-called ""ability-to-repay"" provision for emergency loans, of as little as $500, that are typically repaid on the borrower's next payday. Lenders would have been required to ensure borrowers had the means to repay a loan and meet other living expenses.
On Tuesday, the agency said ""after re-evaluating the legal and evidentiary bases for these provisions and finding them to be insufficient,"" it would remove the provision in its new rule.
""Our actions today ensure that consumers have access to credit from a competitive marketplace, have the best information to make informed financial decisions and retain key protections without hindering that access,"" said the agency's director, Kathy Kraninger, adding that the CFPB would continue to monitor the small dollar lending industry and enforce the law against bad actors.
The CFPB was created in the wake of the 2007-09 global financial crisis to crack down on predatory lenders. While lenders argue its payday rules would effectively eliminate critical stop-gap funding to borrowers, consumer advocates have long criticized the lenders for saddling borrowers with annualized interest rates that often reach several hundred percent.
Democrat Joe Biden, who will face Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election, said in a statement the decision was ""a windfall to predatory lenders"" and would be a burden for working families already struggling in the coronavirus pandemic.
""To loosen restrictions against predatory behavior by payday lenders is shameful by itself, but to do it in the middle of a devastating pandemic as countless families face unimaginable financial hardship is completely inexcusable,"" Biden said.
The new measure does not alter the payments provisions of the 2017 rule, which prohibit lenders from making a new attempt to withdraw funds from an account where two consecutive attempts have failed unless consumers consent to further withdrawals, the agency said.
Industry groups, including the Community Financial Services Association of America, argued the agency's measure doesn't go far enough.
""We are very disappointed the CFPB chose to leave the payment provisions of the original rule intact. The Bureau’s own evidence didn’t support its payment practices provisions, which were flawed and based on unsupported data, much like the ability-to-repay provisions,"" said D. Lynn DeVault, CFSA's chairman.
Charla Rios, a researcher at the Washington-based, consumer-advocate group, Center for Responsible Lending, said that the ongoing coronavirus disruption may lead to greater demand for small-dollar lending and the CFPB's rule actively facilitates harm to consumers at a time of crisis and uncertainty.
""Families need the CFPB to instead work to ensure that they are treated fairly by enforcing the common sense rule that payday lenders should make loans that borrowers can reasonably afford to repay,"" Rios said.

492,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 08:09PM ET</span>",Fed Highlights Scope for More Action If Reopening Economy Stalls,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said officials would likely turn to additional forward guidance and asset purchases if the economy needs more aid, as another official warned of the risk from rising Covid infections.
“We have a lot of accommodation in place. There is more that we can do. There is more that we will do if we need to,” the Fed’s No. 2 said in an interview Tuesday on CNN International.
In terms of extra tools, Clarida cited “additional forms of forward guidance that the Fed has used in the past and we would consider using in the future” as well as noting current Fed purchases of Treasuries and mortgages to support market functioning, while adding “there’s more that we could do in terms of our balance sheet as needed.”
Fed officials held interest rates near zero at their meeting in June and signaled they would keep them there through 2022. Minutes of the June 9-10 gathering showed officials saw the economy needing support “for some time” and that they favored a more explicit form of forward guidance on the future path of rates and bond buying. The central bank meets again at the end of this month.
Rising Infections
Recent data has come in better than expected, including the addition of 4.8 million jobs in June. But a rise in coronavirus infections shows the risk of setbacks as the economy reopens from pandemic lockdown.
“We have seen an increase in cases in certain large states. We are not epidemiologists. We are following it closely,” said Clarida, who added that a so-called double-dip recession was not the central bank’s base-case outlook. “The course of the economy is going to depend on the course of the virus.”
Atlanta Fed chief Raphael Bostic, in remarks earlier Tuesday, cautioned that the renewed spread of Covid-19 may be threatening the pace of the U.S. recovery, as businesses and consumers put plans on hold.
‘Getting Nervous’
“People are getting nervous again,” Bostic said Tuesday during a virtual discussion hosted by the Tennessee Business Roundtable. “Business leaders are getting worried. Consumers are getting worried. There is a real sense that this might go on longer than we had hoped and we had expected and we had planned for.”
Congress is debating more stimulus measures amid a resurgence of the coronavirus, which the White House is pushing for before the lawmakers’ August recess. The $600 weekly in additional unemployment benefits that were passed as part of the March $2 trillion CARES Act are set to expire at the end of the month.
“If we don’t get further fiscal support, things won’t come back as well as they could,” Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told CNBC television in an interview later Tuesday. With disruption from the virus lasting longer than expected, “this is a period where we need to be supporting both individuals and businesses who but for the pandemic would have been healthy,” she said.

The administration can get the Reserve Bank of India to buy sovereign bonds directly or boost dividends to help supplement revenue, which has been hit by an economy-crippling lockdown to contain the virus’s spread. The government is facing a budget deficit of as high as 7% of gross domestic product, the widest in more than two decades, according to some estimates.
It would “make sense to go for some form of deficit monetization” right away, said Sabyasachi Kar, RBI chair professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy in New Delhi. “Demand creation can only happen if the government spends.”
Central banks from the U.S. to Japan are helping to fund record fiscal stimulus from their governments amid the pandemic. That’s even been the case in emerging markets like Indonesia -- where the central bank this week agreed to buy billions of dollars of bonds directly from the government. The approach though carries risks for developing economies, especially for inflation, the currency and the independence of the central bank.
India’s Fiscal Responsibility and and Budget Management Act prevents the RBI from buying bonds directly from the government in the primary market, but the law provides an escape clause in the event of the country facing a national calamity or a severe slowdown.
Discreet Purchases
The RBI has so far made some discreet bond purchases in the secondary market, but the government’s debt manager is yet to outline a plan on how it will manage the administration’s record 12 trillion rupees ($160 billion) of borrowings in the current fiscal year to March.
For now, banks are amassing sovereign bonds on optimism the central bank will soak up the debt supply. Lenders awash with cash, given poor demand for loans in the economy, have raised their holdings of sovereign notes to 41.4 trillion rupees as of June 19, up 13% from end-March.
“We still think it is feasible to finance a deficit of around 11% of GDP -- center and states -- without resorting to large amounts of RBI financing,” said Sergi Lanau, deputy chief economist at the International Institute of Finance in Washington. “Banks have already bought many bonds and with an economy in recession, they may not have many opportunities to lend to firms anyway.”
Ratings Overhang
A possible credit rating downgrade is another risk for India, which is heading for its first economic contraction in more than four decades this year. The credit score of Asia’s third-largest economy is only a step away from junk at Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service, both of which have kept the sovereign on negative watch citing deteriorating fiscal strength.
Economists in a Bloomberg survey expect the nation’s fiscal deficit this year to hit 7% of GDP -- a level last seen in 1994 -- against a target of 3.5%. The International Monetary Fund sees the country’s public debt rising to 85.7% of GDP next year from around 70% now.
While the threat of a rating downgrade may reduce the likelihood of the central bank buying bonds directly from the government, there is room for the RBI to rescue the government by way of a dividend payout in August.
The “RBI would be required to partially bailout the government by allowing its revaluation reserves to be utilized,” said Kunal Kundu, an economist with Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) GSC Pvt., adding there is also the possibility that the government could issue a special “Covid bond” to tide over the expenses or the shortfall caused by the virus.
The government has budgeted 600 billion rupees as dividend from the central bank this year, while it received a record 1.76 trillion rupees in payout last year. The RBI pays dividends to the government every year, based on the profits from its investments and printing of currency notes.
Forbidden Fruit
The government has so far limited actual fiscal stimulus to 1%-1.5% of GDP. Of late, it has scaled back on spending, which Bloomberg Economics’ Abhishek Gupta says will deepen the recession worries. He is projecting a GDP contraction of 10.6% in the current financial year.
For policy makers, it’s a tightrope walk with no easy solution. While inflation has more or less been under control since a Monetary Policy Committee headed by the central bank governor was set up four years ago, those gains could easily evaporate.
The experiences of the 1980s when India used to resort to deficit financing and which led to double-digit inflation is probably a reason why the central bank would be reluctant to step in, according to Hugo Erken, a senior economist at Rabobank International in Utrecht in the Netherlands.
“There is a risk in all of this,” said Erken. “Once you start using the money printer and touch the ‘forbidden fruit,’ it is hard to go back.”

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A Pennsylvania hospital led by biotech billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong won approval for up to $5 million in federal aid for small businesses under a coronavirus pandemic loan program, government data show.
The Chan Soon-Shiong Medical Center in Windber, Pennsylvania, was cleared for a loan of between $2 million to $5 million to help keep 490 workers employed under the U.S. government Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).
Soon-Shiong, 67, is a high-profile biotech executive and physician with an estimated net worth of $7.6 billion, according to Forbes.
He took control of the 54-bed, nonprofit hospital in 2016, and it was renamed for his wife, Michele Chan, and himself. He serves as the hospital's chairman. 
The Paycheck Protection Program enables small businesses harmed by the pandemic to apply for a forgivable government-backed loan from a lender. As part of the application, companies had to certify that “current economic uncertainty makes this loan necessary to support” their ongoing operations.
A spokeswoman for Soon-Shiong did not immediately comment on the loan and whether the hospital used the money. A hospital representative did not respond to a request for comment.
Soon-Shiong runs several medical companies, two of which are working on a potential vaccine to prevent infection by the novel coronavirus -  NantKwest  Inc (O:NK) and his privately-held ImmunityBio.

He also owns the Los Angeles Times newspaper and is part owner of the Los Angeles Lakers NBA basketball team. In April, the team returned $4.6 million in PPP aid amid scrutiny of the loans.

(Reuters) - A surge in coronavirus cases that threatens to pinch consumer spending and job gains just as some stimulus programs are due to expire has Federal Reserve policymakers worried, with at least one pledging more support ahead from the U.S. central bank.
""We have a lot of accommodation in place; there's more that we can do, there's more that we will do,"" Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida told CNN International on Tuesday. 
There is ""no limit"" to the amount of bond buying the Fed can do, he said, adding that the Fed could also ease policy further with forward guidance and will keep its lending backstops in place as long as needed.
While evidence of an economic rebound in May and June was ""very welcome,"" Clarida said, the Fed is following the course of the virus closely as it will determine the course of the economy.
Business owners are ""nervous again,"" Ralph Bostic, president of the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank, said in webcast remarks to the Tennessee Business Roundtable. ""There is a real sense this might go on longer than we have planned for."" 
The next three to six weeks could prove critical in the pace of an economic recovery that Bostic suggested may plateau sooner and at a lower pace than has been expected.
At an event sponsored by the National Association of Business Economists, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly sounded a similar tone. 
After large swathes of the U.S. economy reopened and trillions of dollars in fiscal stimulus passed by Congress in March began to reach the unemployed and hard-hit businesses, the economy created 7.5 million jobs in May and June. 
Those gains mean the labor market is ""in better shape than I thought it might be – but it’s nowhere close to where we need to be,"" Daly said. U.S. firms today employ 14.7 million fewer people than in February, government data show, and unemployment, at 11.1%, is higher than it was in any downturn since the Great Depression. 
""I am assuming that we’ll level off at some level that’s not where we want to be,"" Daly said, noting the ""untenable"" position of state and local governments, which will need to cut staff as tax revenue declines and spending on safety net services increases.
With the virus still circulating, there's a limit to how much people will want to risk their health eating out or undertaking other potentially risky economic activity, she and others said. 
“We saw reopening in May and activity started to come back pretty well,” Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said in a CNBC interview. “Now over the past week or so there’s been some leveling off and I think it’s probably due to an increase in cases, not only in Ohio, but across the country.""
Florida, Texas and California are among roughly two dozen states that have experienced an alarming rise in infections in the past two weeks, and their governors have forced some businesses to shut down again to quell the spread. 
A Fed survey released on Tuesday morning showed Americans may be hunkering down for a longer-than-expected fight against the virus and its economic fallout. 
The poll of 1,869 people, which took place between June 3 and 12 as the first signs emerged of a newly growing coronavirus caseload, showed 46% of respondents think it will take more than a year for conditions to return to normal. That is up from 35% in an April survey. 
At the end of July, some of the government programs to support businesses and families during the pandemic will expire, including a $600-a-week addition to unemployment benefits that has shored up spending among low-income households particularly.
""Individuals need more help and I think state and local governments need more help,"" Cleveland Fed's Mester said, adding that her forecast, which anticipates a ""long recovery phase,"" assumes Congress will deliver more such fiscal aid.
If not, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said on Tuesday, the economy faces ""some very real risks"" as some businesses and households struggle to pay bills and repay debt. 
Bostic agreed. 

""It is pretty clear this is going to go on beyond the expiration of relief efforts,"" Bostic said, adding that as that becomes clear, elected officials might ""strongly consider doing more.""

“If 2020 was like the previous three years, I would expect there to be 21.9 million of them living with their parents. Instead there are 24.8 million living at home, an increase of 2.9 million from the expected number,” according to a Monday blog post by Philip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. “That is a lot of rent not being spent.”
Utilizing data from the Labor Department’s current population survey, Cohen found that biggest increases were among 21-year-old men and 20-year-old women. There was a marked increase for Black young adults, according to Cohen’s post. Nearly 60% of young adult Black men are living with parents or grandparents, the highest share of any race and gender group.
“The younger cohorts have been hit very hard by the pandemic. A lot of the job losses have been in leisure and hospitality, in retail, industries where they employ a lot of younger people. So this recession has — the impact has been disproportionate,” said Ryan Sweet, head of monetary policy research at Moody’s Analytics.
In recent months, men in particular have been dropping out to the labor force quickly as the health crisis disrupts a once-solid job market.
“Future research will have to determine which of the many possible disruptions to their lives is driving this event,” Cohen said.

498,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>",Many countries may need debt restructuring after pandemic fallout: IMF chief economist,"By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Many countries may need debt restructuring in the aftermath of the global coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout, the International Monetary Fund's chief economist said on Tuesday.
Gita Gopinath told an online event hosted by the University of Oxford that there was no debt crisis at the moment, but there would be a ""much more persistent need for debt relief for the poorer nations of this world"" given the pandemic.
Given that about 40% of low-income countries were already in debt distress or at high risk of getting there, with the number growing, she said there could well be ""a need for debt restructuring in many countries.""
The comments came a day before the Group of 20 major economies and the Paris Club of official creditors hosts a high-level conference on debt, capital flows and sustainable finance in the context of the pandemic-triggered economic crisis.
G20 finance ministers, the leaders of the IMF and the World Bank and private-sector creditors will discuss options for responding to capital outflows from emerging markets, debt challenges, and how best to foster strong, sustainable growth.
Gopinath and other international finance experts have said they believe a freeze in debt service payments offered by G20 countries to the poorest nations through year-end should be extended.
They have also called repeatedly for increased participation in the G20 debt moratorium by the private sector.
The newly appointed chief economist of the World Bank, Carmen Reinhart, told the online event that the initial timeline for the G20 debt initiative would have to be revisited and the debt restructuring process needed to become faster and more expedient.

""The main constraint is making sure that everybody's on board, which has not been the case,"" she said, noting that the participation of the private sector ""hasn't happened.""

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A roster of businesses receiving a piece of the $660 billion U.S. Paycheck Protection Program illustrates how deeply the government's pandemic aid has reached into the everyday lives of Americans, yet at the same time how unevenly and fleetingly.
Take, for example, Oakland, California, a city of nearly half a million across the bay from San Francisco. 
Among those approved for a forgivable loan of at least $150,000, data released Monday showed: the iconic Children's Fairyland, the zoo, and the city's best-known ice cream parlor. 
Kymberly Miller, Fairyland's executive director, said she used the $400,000 loan to pay her 56 staff. The funds run out Tuesday. 
The outdoor amusement park for the very young has been closed since March, and state health orders look likely to prevent any reopening until August at the earliest. 
Financially, Miller said, ""we're on the bubble ... it's not a pretty picture."" 
The city's zoo, too, has depleted its loan, which was between $2 million and $5 million. Fenton's Creamery, which got its start in Oakland in 1894, got a loan of between $1 million and $2 million.
The Oakland Hills Tennis Club received its loan of between $150,000 and $350,000 in April, when it was closed, and has not been charging members full dues since. In a newsletter published this month on its website, it told members it had depleted its PPP loan and, even as it has partially reopened, has begun to furlough some of its 51 employees. Calls and an email to the club weren't returned. 
Along Telegraph Avenue, which cuts across the city north to south, some 40 recipients included Bay Area Legal Aid, which provides free legal assistance to low-income people; several medical and dental offices; one Korean restaurant among at least a dozen clustered together; and a cannabis sales software firm called Treez. 
On College Avenue, which starts in neighboring Berkeley at the University of California campus and ends at the California College of the Arts, 20 different businesses are listed as recipients, including one of Oakland's best-known pizza shops, Zachary's, which got between $1 million and $2 million. 
La Farine bakery and its neighbor Wood Tavern each got between $350,000 and $1 million, but on the same block the clothing store, which just reopened, and the dog groomer, which has not, are not on the list of recipients, nor are the two restaurants across the street. 
It is not clear, though, if those businesses received no aid under PPP because the list of names released by the Treasury Department and Small Business Administration on Monday covered only those approved for $150,000 or more, which accounted for 73% of the disbursed funds. Indeed, the vast majority of loan recipients - more than 4.2 million out of nearly 4.9 million nationally - took less than that amount, with the average loan totaling $107,000.

Oakland businesses received about 7,500 loans, of which 1,100 were for more than $150,000. In all, the loans totaled between $460 million and $1.1 billion, the data shows.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon is facing a ""financial siege"" imposed by international powers and its priority is staving off strife caused by the country's economic meltdown, leading politician Gebran Bassil said on Tuesday.
Bassil, an ally of the Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah, said he supported talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), hoping they would pressure the state into reforms, but that Lebanon was running out of time and any foreign aid could not come at the price of sovereignty. 
Talks with the IMF were put on hold last week after becoming bogged down by a dispute on the Lebanese side over the scale of losses in the financial system and pending the start of reforms to address the root causes of the crisis, seen as the biggest threat to Lebanon's stability since the 1975-90 civil war.
The government of Prime Minister Hassan Diab, which is backed by Bassil and Hezbollah, has yet to embark on serious reforms sought by donors including the United States and France, which say Beirut must fix state waste and corruption before any aid is released.
""What we are subjected to is an economic, financial and political siege ... This doesn't pardon the state and the Lebanese from their mistakes ... at the forefront of them -- corruption,"" Bassil said in an interview.
""When there is a desire to help Lebanon, tomorrow the gates will be opened. And when there are great powers blocking the gates, Lebanon does not have capacity to open them."" 
""The absolute priority ... is how to keep Lebanon away from anarchy and strife."" 
Lebanese must also be protected from extreme poverty, said Bassil, a son-in-law of President Michel Aoun. 
Hezbollah is classified as a terrorist group by the United States. The group's influence in state affairs has grown since it won a parliamentary majority with its allies in 2018.
Opponents say the alliance forged by Aoun and Bassil with the heavily-armed Hezbollah has provided political cover for its arsenal.
Though critics say he exercises wide influence over the government, Bassil said no ministers were members of the Free Patriotic Movement he leads, and the cabinet must accelerate reforms. 
""We don't accept this model of low productivity,"" he said of the government, which he said could not continue if it failed to do more.
Asked if he saw a risk to peace, Bassil said: ""Of course this fear exists.""
The response, he said, was ""in national unity"" and dialogue.
He warned of the risk of ""an international game"" unfolding to weaken Lebanon or ""a party in Lebanon such as Hezbollah"".

""Syria must be a lesson for all. It would be a shame to take Lebanon on the path to destruction once again,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Further waves of the novel coronavirus are surely on the way and they will be one of the determinants of Britain's economic outlook, Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane said on Tuesday.
""How big will be the second and third and fourth wave peaks? They surely will come,"" Haldane said in an online talk for Buckingham University.
""What's to play for is how large those peaks will be.""
Haldane, who last week described the shape of Britain's economic recovery from the coronavirus lockdown as ""so far, so V"", said household spending was bouncing back sharply.
""Since 'Super Saturday', we've seen something of a pick up too of people spending in restaurants and bars,"" Haldane said, referring to the reopening of pubs and eateries at the weekend.
""That leaves the level of activity still materially below its pre-COVID levels. But nonetheless, the direction of travel has been upwards.""
He repeated his view that the recovery so far had been faster than the BoE or any other mainstream economic forecaster had predicted, although he acknowledged there were huge uncertainties about the longer-term outlook.

Other economists have said the current rebound in activity may be no more than a release of demand that had pent up during lockdown and that talk of a recovery in the true sense may be premature.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - When Mexico's leader enters the White House to meet President Donald Trump on Wednesday, he will do so not only as a hostage to the whims of his U.S. counterpart, but also as partner in an unlikely alliance that has benefited both men.
Once vowing to stand up to Trump, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has yielded repeatedly on the American leader's major concerns: migration, border security and trade.
Yet at the same time, Trump has given the Mexican leftist leeway to pursue a disruptive nationalist oil vision.
Lopez Obrador has clawed back more state control of energy policy, and is trying to renegotiate billions of dollars in contracts agreed under his predecessor with a slew of powerful foreign investors, Americans among them.
There has been little objection from the White House, where Lopez Obrador will meet Trump for the first time.
Provided his priorities are met, ""it's all the same to Trump what Lopez Obrador does in the rest of Mexico,"" said Sergio Alcocer, a former Mexican deputy foreign minister.
There is pressure from the U.S. private sector to have Trump raise concerns with Lopez Obrador about his government's energy policy, a former senior U.S. official said.
However, Trump, who aggressively sought to discourage U.S. investment abroad during his 2015-16 ""America First"" election campaign, has yet to go after Mexico on the issue.
That will not have been lost on Lopez Obrador, said Alcocer.
Critics of the summit, including some U.S. Democrats, see the meeting as a bid by Trump to win over American voters of Mexican descent ahead of his November re-election bid.
A Democratic administration under Trump's opponent Joe Biden may be less indulgent toward Lopez Obrador on his energy agenda, which has threatened investments in renewable power generation, a key issue for many on the left of the U.S. political spectrum.
The summit was conceived to celebrate the start of a new three-nation North American trade deal that took effect on July 1, although Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau opted out. 
The meeting will likely see Washington commit to providing medical supplies to Mexico like test kits and access to any U.S. coronavirus vaccine, according to officials from both nations.
Some on the Mexican side are nervous about how respectfully Trump will behave toward his guest as he gears up for the final stretch of his re-election campaign - and whether anything of substance will transpire.
""If nothing comes out of the meeting, it will look like he just went up to help Trump electorally,"" said a Mexican official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
HISTORY
An avid history buff, Lopez Obrador frequently alludes to how Mexico's fortunes have fared under the influence of the United States. He has been careful to avoid upsetting Trump since assuming the Mexican presidency in December 2018.
It was not always so.
When Trump entered the White House in 2017, Lopez Obrador likened the American to Adolf Hitler for his attitude toward migrants. Campaigning a year later, after Mexico had endured a torrid time from Trump over trade and migration, Lopez Obrador vowed to put him ""in his place"" if elected. 
Still, when Trump in 2019 threatened to slap tariffs on Mexican goods if Lopez Obrador did not reinforce his borders and curb migration from Central America, the latter quickly deployed thousands of troops and cut the flow of people.
That has earned Lopez Obrador derision from opponents.
""I can't remember us ever having a relationship of such subordination as we have now with Trump,"" said opposition Senator Clemente Castaneda of the Citizens' Movement party.
But a recent poll showed most Mexicans support Lopez Obrador's Trump meeting, which he has pitched as a matter of necessity as Mexico seeks to revive its economy from the coronavirus pandemic. Despite failing to lift growth and reduce violence, the Mexican president remains fairly popular.
Dominating the news with daily press conferences, he has helped polarize the political landscape, pouring scorn on adversaries, bristling against curbs on his power and slamming critical media in a way that has drawn comparisons to Trump.
But old tensions could still arise.
Although apprehensions of migrants at the U.S. southern border are way down on 2019, they increased slightly in May and the proportion of Mexicans among them has risen sharply.

And with the U.S. election tight, it would ""not appear to be very clever"" for Trump to ignore the oil industry, a traditional base of Republican support, said Alcocer.

(Reuters) - Travelers (NYSE:TRV) are hitting the road again and taking vacations even as the coronavirus pandemic shows no signs of abating in many countries, a survey on Tuesday showed.
About 51% of people in North America and Latin America plan to book trips in the next six months, compared with 38% in Asia and Europe, according to the survey by software maker  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL).
However, travelers want to stay close to home, preferring to drive and to avoid international trips.
Due to travel restrictions and lengthy lockdowns in many countries to control the spread of the novel coronavirus, tens of thousands of hotels have closed and occupancy levels have fallen below 20% for weeks, said Alex Alt, general manager of Oracle Hospitality.
""One thing that's refreshing is that consumers want to travel,"" he told Reuters. ""There is a resilience and an appetite to be on the road, to explore, to experience."" 
With U.S. coastal towns a favorite destination, occupancy among 600 U.S. hotels that Oracle tracks has risen for five straight weeks and recently hit its highest levels since mid-March. 
""I'd say the industry largely expects it to continue through the summer months,"" Alt said. ""The key will be for the business travel to come back to complement that leisure travel.""  
COVID-19 cases have surged around the United States and the death toll has topped 130,000, prompting the European Union last week to exclude Americans travelers for its ""safe"" travel list. 
To assuage concerns about infections, 90% of hotels have increased or planned to increase cleaning and disinfecting. In addition, 70% of hotels already are or are planning to adopt contactless technology for check-in, food ordering and concierge services, according to the survey.

Oracle surveyed 4,600 consumers and 1,800 hotel executives in the United States, Mexico, United Kingdom, Germany, Singapore and Australia in mid-April through early May.

“People are getting nervous again,” Bostic said Tuesday during a virtual discussion hosted by the Tennessee Business Roundtable. “Business leaders are getting worried. Consumers are getting worried. There is a real sense that this might go on longer than we had hoped and we had expected and we had planned for.”
While recent U.S. economic data has been better than expected, including the addition of 4.8 million jobs in June, Bostic said he was worried that more employment losses would become permanent rather than temporary if the economy fails to gather strength as hoped.
The Labor Department’s household survey showed more than 2.8 million Americans permanently lost their jobs in June, a 588,000 increase from a month earlier that was the biggest since the start of 2009.
Confidence in the economy seems to be retreating among Americans, Bostic said.
“That worry, that lack of confidence, is a critical thing that we all need to be mindful of, that I definitely need to be mindful of, as so much of the U.S. economy is based on confidence,” he said.
Increasing cases of the virus have prompted some states to curtail or reverse some of their reopening plans, and Florida and Georgia – both in the Atlanta Fed district – have been among the states seeing big increases in cases, along with Arizona, Texas and California.
“The spikes in positive tests suggest that the virus is spreading faster in some places, not slower,” Bostic said. “That might suggest we might need to do better and do more in terms of following and respecting our social distance requests and do things like wear masks.”
Bostic, who doesn’t vote on monetary policy this year, said the Fed stands ready to continue to provide support for the economy, adding the central bank is in no hurry to shut down any of its emergency lending facilities whose usage could go up if the economic slump were to continue for a prolonged period.

(Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Tuesday promised to revive U.S. manufacturing so that the country is not dependent on China, taking aim at his rival's promises to revive factories.
Biden's team said a policy plan to create manufacturing jobs is coming ""soon"" but offered early hints in a document outlining how they would prevent shortages of equipment to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
""Just like the United States itself, no U.S. ally should be dependent on critical supplies from countries like China and Russia,"" Biden's campaign said in a new five-page policy outline, including not just coronavirus supplies but also energy-grid technologies, semiconductors and raw materials.
Biden faces President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 presidential election. The president made manufacturing and tough-on-China trade policies a hallmark of his time in office, making his inaugural address about the need to put ""America First"" and end an ""American carnage,"" including companies shipping blue-collar jobs overseas.
More recently, the Trump administration has suggested the supply crunch around masks, medical gowns, testing materials, ventilators during the pandemic highlighted the need to encourage more domestic manufacturing. Trump's team has also criticized Biden for support of trade deals they said killed U.S. jobs.
The issue is critical for voters in so-called ""Rust Belt"" states from Pennsylvania to Michigan, who face an ongoing pandemic but have also lost manufacturing jobs over many decades as lower-wage countries including China started competing in that sector. Trump carried both swing states narrowly in 2016, helping him win.

As part of his plan, Biden pledged to sign an executive order requiring his administration to identify which products the country could run short on and fix the problem. That could include forcing companies to make certain products or using federal spending to encourage domestic production rather than buying imported goods.

In conversations with managers in his Southern district, where several states are facing a renewed health crisis, Bostic said he is asking ""what are their plans for the next three weeks, six weeks, how are they thinking about staffing decisions.""
That period could prove critical in the pace of an economic recovery Bostic suggested may plateau sooner and at a lower pace than expected.
At the end of July, some of the programs approved to support businesses and families during the pandemic will expire, most notably the $600-a-week addition to unemployment benefits.
With the caseload growing again, Bostic said it may become apparent that a longer bridge to the post-pandemic world is needed. 

""It is pretty clear this is going to go on beyond the expiration of relief efforts,"" Bostic said, adding that as the fact becomes clear, elected officials might ""strongly consider doing more.""

The number of available positions rose to 5.4 million during the month from 5 million in April, according to the Labor Department’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released Tuesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 4.5 million openings. Job openings that involve workers recalled from layoffs or positions that are only offered internally are not counted in the figure.
Separations, which include layoffs and quits, plummeted by 5.83 million in May. The rate of layoffs and discharges dropped to 1.4% from 5.9% in April and closer to the pre-pandemic rate of 1.2%.
In a jobs market where millions are still out of work, the quits rate, which measures voluntary job leavers as a share of total employment, advanced to 1.6% from a nine-year low of 1.4%. At the start of the year, when the jobs market was at its best in decades, the quits rate was near the highest level in history.
Labor Churn
The JOLTS report illustrates the dichotomy of a jobs market defined by churn. Employers, on net, are adding workers to payrolls, as evidenced by two straight record monthly increases in May and June, according to the agency’s monthly jobs data. Yet with demand in many industries only gradually building, many workers continue to get caught up in the economic fallout of the pandemic and the recession it spurred.
The number of hires, which does include rehired employees, surged a record 2.44 million to an all-time high of 6.5 million. The hires rate jumped to an unprecedented 4.9% from 3.1%.
Finding work remains incredibly challenging for the jobless. There were 3.9 unemployed workers competing for every job opening in May. That underscores the current slack in the labor market and stands in stark contrast to a two-year trend in which vacancies exceeded the number of unemployed.
The JOLTS data lag behind the monthly employment report by a month, but it offers a level of detail not available in the jobs report. However, the two are not directly comparable across all categories. For employment, the reference period is the pay period that includes the 12th of the month -- the same as the payroll survey in the jobs report -- but for job openings it’s the last business day of the month and for hires and separations, it’s the entire calendar month.

“I think we want to make sure that people that are still unemployed or hurting are protected but at the same time, we want to take into consideration the fact the economy is bouncing back and want to try to contain the amount of spending,” Marc Short, Pence’s chief of staff, said Tuesday in an interview with Bloomberg Radio.
“There’s obviously been a lot of stimulus put in the system over the last couple bills, and so the price tag for us would be that.”
The White House and lawmakers are set to intensify talks on a new package of virus-related stimulus this month, as they return to Washington after the Independence Day holiday.
Short said the White House views liability protections as “essential” for companies to bring workers back and fully re-open the economy.
The House is scheduled to begin its recess by Aug. 3, with the Senate following a week later. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he wants Congress to complete work on the next phase of stimulus by then.
“By that time table, we want to have a bill on the president’s desk,” Short said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Top British and European Union negotiators will dine at Number 10 Downing Street later on Tuesday, kicking off the latest round of Brexit talks that have all but stalled because of major differences over their future relationship.
Last week's round was cut short with both sides saying that, while they wanted an agreement, they had yet to overcome the gulf in positions that could see Britain leaving a status-quo transition period at the end of this year without a trade deal.
After leaving the EU in January, Britain is keen to strike out alone, pursuing trade deals with other countries and setting up its own sanctions regime, and has insisted it should not have to sign up to the bloc's standards.
Brussels has also stood firm, with EU negotiator Michel Barnier saying last week there could be no economic partnership without ""robust guarantees for a level playing field - including on state aid - to ensure open and fair competition"".
""(UK negotiator) David Frost and Michel Barnier are having dinner at Number 10 this evening for informal talks,"" said a spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
""The dinner tonight kicks off the talks and then tomorrow there'll be teams of officials from the UK and from the EU sitting down having further discussions.""
With a starter of asparagus and a dessert of summer fruits, Downing Street might be hoping to sweeten the talks, although the main course of fillet of halibut might be a nod to another stumbling block in the talks over fisheries.
Asked whether Britain had new proposals, the spokesman said: ""I am sure discussions will cover everything from what the EU calls the level playing field through to governance structures.""

510,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 09:35AM ET</span>","As Lebanon crisis spirals, families barter for food on Facebook","BEIRUT (Reuters) - One Lebanese woman asked for sugar, milk and soap in exchange for a child's dress. Another wanted canned goods in return for gym equipment. 
A 65-year-old seamstress now exchanges her sewing services for food, because her clients can no longer afford to pay her. 
Bartering on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has become the last resort for some people in Lebanon, where a financial meltdown has sent prices skyrocketing this year. 
""It's a good thing for people who are in need and unable to buy...You can't keep asking for help,"" said Siham, a 27-year-old mother who was offering a machine that cleans her son's nursing bottles in exchange for food.
More and more Lebanese have had to turn to charities or private initiatives to survive as the country faces a crisis on an unprecedented scale. 
The collapse of the currency, which wiped out nearly 80% of its value, has pushed many families into poverty and the heavily indebted state offers little help.
Hassan Hasna's Facebook group ""Lebanon barters"" has gained more than 16,000 members in about a month, with people relying on it to secure food or medicine they can no longer afford. 
""A group of my friends and I were able to help some families around Christmas time but now we can't even get enough supplies to donate,"" he said. 
Lebanon depends heavily on imported goods for which prices have soared. The government has also hiked the price of subsidised bread, sparking protests this month.
A World Food Programme report in June found that 50% of Lebanese feared they would not have enough to eat. 
Hasna gets over 200 requests a day. 
""Some people perceive bartering as a terrible thing, using it to explain how desperate we are. But I don't see it that way,"" he said.

""Times are difficult but we won't go begging for aid. They're doing the impossible to survive, and live with dignity.""

511,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>",Virus crisis exposes tensions over tighter controls for investment funds,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's market watchdog is resisting calls for stricter rules on investment funds, putting the regulator at odds with the Bank of England which wants tighter controls to prevent them becoming a source of contagion in financial markets.
The BoE has said these funds may need stronger controls after the turmoil triggered by the coronavirus pandemic exposed their potential threat to financial stability because unlike banks they do not hold reserves of capital.
Britain's commercial property funds, for example, had to stop investors asking for their money back on a daily basis when extreme market volatility hit in March after economies entered lockdown.
Money market funds, a key source of short-term funding for companies, could have become a source of ""contagion"" during a COVID ""dash for cash"" had central banks not eased a liquidity crunch, the Bank of England said last month.
""How do we deal with the risks posed to financial stability by the structural tendency for money market and some other open-ended funds to be prone to runs, without having to commit scarce public money to costly support facilities?"" the BoE said.
But Britain's Financial Conduct Authority does not want to rush to impose tighter rules because investment funds can be an important source of cash for companies coping with the crisis. 
""We are still very much in the context of a continuing health crisis,"" Nausicaa Delfas, head of international at Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told Reuters.
""It's important that we recognise that the non-bank sector is critical in enabling recapitalisation of companies to promote growth and recovery from the pandemic,"" Delfas said.
""This is definitely looking to the medium and longer term.""
She said global and UK regulators are studying how the financial system operated during the early months of the crisis to see how banks, market infrastructure as well as non-banks functioned collectively under extreme stress.
The tension between central banks and securities watchdogs over regulating funds is not new, having surfaced in 2015 when the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) torpedoed an attempt by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to impose bank-like rules on big asset managers.
""The discussion has calmed down quite a lot since then and there is a recognition of the need to be fully informed,"" a financial market source said.
The FSB referred to an April statement which said that while the pandemic has highlighted potential vulnerabilities in non-banks, it was important to reap the benefits of the dynamic sector and apply existing recommendations.
The FSB will update on its thinking next week.
The BoE noted in a Financial Policy Committee statement in May that ""underlying issues need to be addressed once the immediate problems have passed."" The Bank has said it was in ""close contact"" with other authorities outside Britain.
An update on funds is expected on August 6 from the BoE.
But a senior funds industry official said Brexit and lack of global consensus on what should be done, leaves Britain with only limited room to reform a cross-border sector on its own beyond making a ""noise.""
LOCAL PROBLEM?
Some regulators have noted there has been no global run on funds to indicate a systemic problem, one financial market source said.
March market volatility pointed to problems in the commercial paper market - used for short-term financing - rather than with the money market funds themselves, the source added.
This source said that about 95% of fund assets suspended globally in the pandemic were in UK property funds and that was because of an inability to value assets in extreme conditions.
Before the crisis, the shuttering of a flagship UK open-ended equity fund run by then star stockpicker Neil Woodford had created a sense urgency in Britain for fund industry reform.
But fundamental reform of money market and other open-ended funds like Woodford's will be tough for Britain because 8,317 of 10,930 of those sold in the country come under European Union law, which Britain can no longer influence since Brexit.
And Britain's finance ministry has said that there are no viable UK alternatives to EU money market funds in the short or medium term.
""Any action on sterling money market funds in the UK will likely be in the form of additional requirements on EU money market funds being sold in the UK,"" said Sean Tuffy, head of market and regulatory intelligence at Citi Securities Services.

Fahd Al-Rasheed, president of Riyadh's royal commission, said the government has already committed some $266.6 billion for ongoing and new projects as part of total investments of some $800 billion over the next 10 years in participation with the private sector to transform the city.
""The idea is for Riyadh to become a 15 million person city by 2030,"" he told Reuters, saying growth would create jobs.
""Riyadh is already the epicentre of economic development in the country and the region ... We have now the ambitious plan under Vision 2030 of doubling both our economy and population over the next 10 years.""
Vision 2030 is Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plan to shake up the conservative kingdom by weaning the economy off oil and building new industries and mega projects with the private sector to generate millions of jobs.
But low oil prices and the coronavirus have hit the country's finances at a time when state spending remains its economic engine and large foreign capital inflows have proven elusive. Unemployment among Saudis stands at 11.8%.
Rasheed first disclosed plans to turn the city of some 7 million people into what he then described as a mega-metropolis in an interview with the Arab News daily in January, before the coronavirus swept the world and oil prices collapsed in April.
The government this year launched austerity measures, including a tripling of value-added tax, after posting a budget deficit of $9 billion in the first quarter.
Work on the Riyadh Metro and an industrial and financial zone in the capital continues, and authorities last year announced four initiatives worth $23 billion to improve the city's quality of life.
These include an entertainment complex and sports venues, installing more than 1,000 works of public art and the creation of a park four times the size of New York's Central Park. https://reut.rs/2O4w84W
Rasheed said most of the projects to transform the city are scheduled for completion between 2023 and 2025, but parts of the metro would be running by year's end.
""We know there is a deep need and pent up demand for entertainment: 65% of the population is under 30 and they've been craving this kind of change,"" Rasheed said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A draft annual policy roadmap won't directly mention Japan's target of achieving a primary budget surplus by fiscal 2025, Jiji news agency reported, signalling the government will soft pedal on fiscal reform while fighting the coronavirus downturn.
Saddled with a public debt burden that is more than twice the size of the economy and the heaviest in the industrial world, Japan has embarked on fiscal reforms, and their success can be measured by trends in the primary budget balance, which excludes new bond sales and debt servicing costs.
In the wake of the coronavirus crisis, however, Japan, like many countries, has rolled out massive fiscal stimulus plans. The stimulus so far is equivalent to more than 40% of GDP, making the prospect achieving a budget surplus more distant than ever.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet is expected to endorse the mid-year policy roadmap on July 17, which lays out the government's long-term economic and fiscal policy framework.
The mid-year roadmap, drawn up yearly by the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy (CEFP), Abe's top economic advisory panel, also provides the basis for next fiscal year's budget.
Abe's government initially set its goal of achieving a primary budget surplus by the March fiscal year end in 2021. But it has pushed back in 2018 the target by five years to fiscal 2025.
Dropping a reference to the fiscal target in the key annual policy roadmap would not necessarily mean the government has given up on it altogether, sources with direct knowledge of the debate told Reuters.
Instead, plans on how to achieve the fiscal goal could be put off until a time when the current fog uncertainty begins to lift, they said.
Meantime, ruling party lawmakers who favour unlimited money printing could keep up pressure on the government to guide the country out of recession through unbridled spending.
""Fiscal issue will be a contentious source of debate,"" one of the sources said.

516,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 06:46AM ET</span>","EU sees deeper recession, less steep rebound for euro zone","By Philip Blenkinsop and Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone economy will drop deeper into recession this year and rebound less steeply in 2021 than previously thought, the European Commission forecast on Tuesday, with France, Italy and Spain struggling the most due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The downbeat assessment of Europe's economy comes amid concern the U.S. recovery may also be faltering as a surge of new coronavirus infections prompts states to delay and in some cases reverse plans to let stores reopen and activities resume.
The EU executive said the 19-nation single currency area would contract by a record 8.7% this year before growing by 6.1% in 2021. In early May, the Commission had forecast a 2020 downturn of 7.7% and a 2021 rebound of 6.3%.
The Commission said it had revised its forecasts because the lifting of COVID-19 lockdown measures in euro zone countries was proceeding less swiftly than it had initially predicted.
The EU executive significantly cut its earlier forecasts for France, Italy and Spain, all hit hard by the pandemic, and now expects now downturns in excess of 10% this year in each.
In Germany, the euro zone's largest economy, where widespread testing has helped limit fatalities, the Commission moderated its estimates both of 2020's downturn -- to -6.3% from -6.5% forecast in May -- and next year's rebound. 
Economics Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni told a news conference that to reduce risks of a second recession EU fiscal rules could remain frozen even after growth returns next year.
Requirements that states keep fiscal deficits below 3% of gross domestic product and reduce high debt have been suspended during the pandemic, in an unprecedented move.
Gentiloni, a centre-left former Italian prime minister, said the rules may be reactivated only when the bloc's output returns at least to 2019 levels. But no decision has yet been made and the matter remains controversial.
The Commission also said its inflation forecasts were little changed, at 0.3% this year and 1.1% in 2021.
""HIGH RISKS""
The new growth figures indicate an economic recovery gathering momentum in June, although it is based on a number of ""critical"" assumptions, with ""exceptionally high risks"".
The forecasts assume no second wave of infections triggering renewed restrictions, although social distancing measures would persist, while monetary and fiscal policy measures are expected to support the recovery.
The main risks include a potential wave of new infections, more permanent scars from the crisis including unemployment and corporate insolvencies, and the absence of a future relationship deal between the EU and post-Brexit Britain.
""At the global level, the still rising rate of infections, particularly in the U.S. and emerging markets, has deteriorated the global outlook and is expected to act as a drag on the European economy,"" the report said.
Asked about the impact on the euro zone economy of the fresh spike in COVID-19 infections in the United States, Gentiloni said that economic recovery was ""paved with uncertainty"", mostly caused by disease outbreaks. He praised EU states' approach of gradually restarting their economies while maintaining measures to limit the spread of the virus.
High-frequency data assembled by U.S. Federal Reserve officials, economists, cellphone tracking companies, and employee time management firms suggests activity in the United States has slowed in recent days after upbeat employment data.
Some reopening plans have been put on hold and restrictions placed on the bars, restaurants and other hospitality industry companies that helped the U.S. economy add 4.8 million jobs in June.

In an interview with the Financial Times published on Tuesday, Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic said the U.S. recovery was in danger of stalling due to the spike in coronavirus cases.

Investing.com -- The U.S. recovery is in danger of stalling due to the surge in new Covid-19 infections, according to Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic. The market appears to agree - Wall Street's indices are set to open lower, giving up most of Monday's gains.  The European Commission has also revised down its economic forecasts for the euro zone for the next two years, while a federal court struck a blow to the shale patch of North and South Dakota. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, July 7th.
1. Fed's Bostic warns virus is stalling economic recovery
Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic warned in an interview with the Financial Times that the U.S. recovery is in danger of stalling due to the surge of Covid-19 cases across the south and west in recent weeks.
The U.S.’s top doctor Anthony Fauci said separately that “the current state is not good” and that the U.S. is still “knee-deep in the first wave of this.” He argued that the baseline of cases “never really got where we wanted to go.”
The growth of new Covid-19 infections showed signs of slowing in Texas and Florida, the two states worst affected by the second wave of infections in recent days, while the national rate of new infections dropped to just over 45,000, more than 20% below last week’s daily peaks.
2. Court orders Dakota oil pipeline closed
A Federal district court in Washington ruled that the Dakota Access Pipeline, a key artery for moving shale oil from the Dakotas to markets across the U.S., must shut within 30 days, arguing that a necessary environmental impact study had not been completed.
The pipeline, which can carry 570,000 barrels of oil a day, is a key piece of transport infrastructure for the local oil industry, and the ruling underscores the regulatory risks that were cited by Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) and  Duke Energy  (NYSE:DUK) at the weekend in their decision to abandon their project for a gas pipeline along the Appalachian Trail.
 Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET), the pipeline’s owner, saw its stock fall over 12% on Monday to its lowest in over two months in response to the ruling.
3. Stocks set to open lower, but China parties on
U.S. stocks are set to open lower as concerns mount that the recent rally has gone too far.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), Dow Futures were down 248 points, or 1.0%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was down 0.8% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 0.4%.
Overnight, the exuberance in Chinese stock markets tempered only slightly, with the country’s main indices still rising (although the Hong Kong Hang Seng fell 1.4% on more signs of tech companies withdrawing from the city in response to the new national security law).
Among the stocks in focus later will be Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI), which reports quarterly results after the closing bell. Also of interest will be Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, which rose another 6.5% to a new record high on an upbeat broker's note in after-hours trading on Monday.
4. Europe GDP forecasts revised lower 
The European Commission revised down its forecasts for the eurozone economy this year and next, to reflect a deeper contraction in 2020 and a weaker rebound in 2021.
The Commission now expects the eurozone economy to shrink by 8.7% this year, rather than the 7.7% it expected at its last quarterly update in April, when there were no hard data available to measure the true impact of the pandemic on output.
For next year, it says the euro zone will grow by 6.1%, rather than the 6.3% it originally forecast. The Commission noted that the heavy impact of the virus across the U.S. and key emerging export markets such as Latin America and India would crimp Europe's ability to export its way out of recession. 
German industrial production data for May, released earlier, rebounded by less than expected, as had factory orders data on Monday. There was slightly better news from Italy, where retail sales rebounded 24% in May to be down only 10.5% on the year. U.K. house prices also fell by less than expected in June.
5. Oil holds above $40 despite caution
Crude oil prices weakened but again held above the $40/barrel support level as traders reined in their optimism ahead of key updates on the market.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 1.3% at $40.11 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent fell 1.1% to $42.62 a barrel.
The American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly figures on U.S. oil inventories at 4:30 PM ET (2030 GMT)."
518,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>",Economists call for more direct cash payments tied to the health of the economy,"By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - Direct cash payments can improve financial security, boost consumer spending and may speed up the recovery, according to a letter from a group of economists calling on U.S. policymakers to keep providing direct cash payments to Americans until the economy is stronger. 
The stimulus payments should be issued automatically, based on certain economic indicators such as the unemployment rate, until there is enough evidence that the economy is recovering, the group of mostly left-leaning economists said in an open letter organized by the Economic Security Project and The Justice Collaborative. 
""The first round of economic impact payments were a lifeline that helped some get by for a few weeks,"" the economists wrote. ""Even after businesses start to re-open and jobs begin to come back, there will be significant economic fallout, and demand will continue to lag if people don’t have money to spend.""
The letter was signed by 153 economists, including Jason Furman, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama Administration; Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist; Darrick Hamilton from the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at The Ohio State University; and Indivar Dutta-Gupta, co-executive director at the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality. Some of the signatories are advising the campaign of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
The stimulus payments issued in April under the $2.3 trillion CARES Act helped lift spending for lower income households faster than higher income households, with much of the cash going to essentials, according to an analysis by Harvard University's Opportunity Insights. 
The $600 supplement Congress added to weekly unemployment benefits are set to expire at the end of the month, leaving jobless Americans at risk of facing a cash cliff while jobs are still scarce.

Congressional lawmakers are on a two-week recess and will face pressure to make decisions when they reconvene in late July.

A scarcity of supply has led to rapid rises in rents and levels of homelessness in recent years in Ireland, whose economy was booming until the coronavirus crisis shut it down at the end of March.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit Ireland, the central bank forecast 88,000 new homes would be built over three years: 26,000 in 2020, 30,000 in 2021 and 32,000 in 2022. 
That is likely to fall by around 10,000 for each of the three years, Director of Economics and Statistics Mark Cassidy told a parliamentary committee, a cumulative fall of just over one-third. 
Analysts say around 35,000 homes are needed a year to meet demand.
""We are well short of producing enough housing for our medium-term requirements, so this will exacerbate the situation,"" Cassidy said. 
A second wave of COVID-19 infections in Ireland could increase the fall in supply over three years from 30,000 to 45,000, Cassidy said, a fall of more than half of the original 88,000 forecast. 

Housebuilding in 2022 would fall from around 32,000 to 15,000 in the severe scenario, he said.

520,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. government's boxed food aid promise falls short,"By Christopher Walljasper
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. government delivered far less food aid than it had pledged by the end of June, according to food bank managers and data from the agriculture department sent to Reuters, after it hired inexperienced companies to box food during the pandemic.
The Farmers to Families Food Box program, one of several new government efforts to relieve struggling Americans, aimed to take food from farmers typically produced for restaurants and deliver it to the millions of people who lost their jobs or were otherwise hit by the coronavirus lockdown.
But the program has drawn criticism from food banks, analysts and some U.S. senators for awarding contracts to often inexperienced vendors that were unable to source the food and deliver it in a timely manner.
Data sent to Reuters shows the program fell short of its target to deliver $1.2 billion worth of food to food banks, churches, and other organizations in need by June 30, a goal announced when food box contracts were awarded to private venders on May 8. 
The agency expects to verify a total of 27.5 million food boxes delivered from the first round of the program, a USDA representative said in an email. That is equivalent to $755.5 million, according to calculations by Reuters based on the average cost of food boxes provided by USDA, or 63% of the $1.2 billion pledged. 
Overburdened food banks across the country were optimistic that the program would bring ready-to-deliver food to families in need. 
The program, championed by the daughter of U.S. President Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump, sought to build a bridge between people unable to buy enough food and farmers who were dumping milk, euthanizing hogs and destroying lettuce fields as demand from shuttered restaurants fell off.
But deliveries were slow to start and have amounted to less than promised as some of the companies involved had never worked with food banks or even wholesale food distribution. [L1N2CW2Y0]
""We're getting about 60% of what we were told we would get,"" said Brian Greene, CEO of the Houston Food Bank, in an email. ""Some of it was vendors couldn't do what they said they would do."" 
The USDA representative, who asked not to be named, said the agency is continuing to review food deliveries to ensure quality and safety standards. USDA canceled two contracts within the first few weeks of the program, and did not renew 16 others. The agency representative did not comment on the June 30 delivery shortfall. 
The Trump administration announced up to $3 billion for the Food Box program in April as part of a broader aid initiative for farmers.
Last week, the USDA said it was renewing $1.2 billion in food box contracts from more than 185 food distributors to be delivered by the end of August. The agency is also offering new contracts to 16 new food distributors totaling $180 million. 
'SUPPOSED TO EASE THE BURDEN'
With vendors falling short on deliveries, food banks have reassigned employees to manage the program and volunteered their own trucks to get the food into the hands of those who need it.
""We're dedicating significant staff time to coordinate these deliveries - in some case we have to do the deliveries ourselves,"" said Greg Trotter, senior manager of public relations for the Greater Chicago Food Depository. ""It was supposed to ease some burden from food banks. That has not been the case here for us."" 
When the deliveries come through, Trotter said the program has provided high-quality food to a rising number of out-of-work Americans. The Greater Chicago Food Depository has seen a 90% increase in people served since January.
By early June, the number of Americans facing food insecurity doubled compared with pre-coronavirus, according to data from U.S. Census Bureau's weekly Household Pulse Survey. 
Among the vendors not renewed in the second round was event planner Texas-based CRE8AD8 LLC. The company, pronounced ""Create a Date,"" had to hire people for every role needed to fulfill its $39.13 million contract.

According to the Houston Food Bank's Greene, CRE8AD8 delivered just 17 of its 90 promised food box loads.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Big and mid-cap firms globally are expected to slash capital spending by an average 12% this year as they reel from the fallout of lockdowns and other measures imposed to rein in the coronavirus pandemic, analysts' estimates show.
The predicted cut is bigger than the 11.3% decline that occurred in 2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis and would be the steepest drop in the 14 years for which data compiled by Refinitiv is available.
""For many firms the near-death experience of the lockdown - where cash flows have simply dried up - will have a long-run effect on their willingness to take risks and invest,"" said Keith Wade, chief economist at British asset manager  Schroders  (LON:SDR).
""Weaker investment will also hamper a recovery in productivity and reinforce the outcome of slower GDP growth.""
(Graphic: Estimates for corporate capital spending globally, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmvjlqynvr/global%20capital%20spending%20final.JPG) 
Reuters calculated average spending cuts by looking at estimates compiled by Refinitiv for nearly 4,000 firms.
By sector, energy, consumer discretionary and real estate were seen taking the biggest axes to capital expenditure with cuts of 25%, 23% and 20% forecasted respectively.
Among major names announcing big cuts,  BP  Plc (L:BP),  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM),  General Electric  (N:GE) have all said they will slash 2020 capex by at least 20%.

By country, U.S. companies are expected to slash capex by 22%, Russian firms by 19.2% and French firms by 13.4%. In Asia, South Korean companies led with an average capex drop of 16% predicted, followed by Japanese firms with an 11% slide.
In China, which has managed to bring its coronavirus outbreak under control, the expected decline is much smaller at 4.5%.
(Graphic: Capital spending by country, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklpyzjjdvg/countrywise1.JPG) 
The data also showed analysts expect companies to cut operating costs by 19.7% on an average this year, which would also be the sharpest decline in at least 14 years. Revenue is seen falling 5%.
Mark Litzerman, head of portfolio management at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute, said different industries would show different rates of recovery.
""Hotels, restaurants and leisure, retail and airlines should revive faster, especially assuming the introduction of an effective vaccine,"" he said, as they were hit harder and will recover sharply from a lower base.
A return to previous levels of profitability may take longer, however, due to permanent changes in consumer behavior, he added.

Europe’s economy will suffer more than previously estimated this year and take longer to recover because of a slow easing of coronavirus restrictions, according to the bloc’s executive arm.
Officials sent the starkest warning yet about the impact of the pandemic, with the divergences between richer and poorer countries opening up even further than projected two months ago.
It now forecasts a contraction of 8.7% in the euro area this year, a full percentage point deeper than previously predicted. Risks remain “exceptionally high and mainly to the downside,” the European Commission said.
Valdis Dombrovskis, an executive vice president of the commission, said the projection is a “powerful illustration” of why European Union leaders need to agree on a groundbreaking 750 billion-euro ($847 billion) recovery plan that would see nations borrow jointly on financial markets.
“Looking forward to this year and next, we can expect a rebound but we will need to be vigilant about the differing pace of the recovery,” he said in a statement.
After the lifting of lockdown measures, the European economy is at a critical juncture. While the initial rebound has been swift, policy makers have cautioned against reading too much into those early indications because progress toward reaching pre-crisis levels is going to be slow.
Forecasts for France, Italy and Spain saw some of the biggest revisions on Tuesday, and will all shrink more than 10%. Germany is expected to fare a little better -- at minus 6.3% -- than in the commission’s projection from early May.
There is a “wide dispersion of recovery paths,” reflecting different timing of containment measures as well as the structure of their economies and the magnitude of policy responses, it said.
Governments have deployed unprecedented stimulus to contain the fallout of the pandemic, but there’s been increasing concern about the uneven distribution between richer and poorer countries. EU leaders are meeting July 17-18 to try to agree on a recovery program that would distribute some of the burden across the bloc, though they’re still at odds over key aspects of the plan.
The threat of a second wave of infections was highlighted by several local outbreaks in recent weeks. Spain’s Catalan government had to put a region under lockdown after cases soared and the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia imposed restrictions on a municipality following an outbreak in a large meat-processing plant.
Southern European countries are being hit especially hard by the recession, partly because they rely heavily on tourism. The industry will lose at least $1.2 trillion globally this year amid crippling travel restrictions and consumer wariness, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
The commission also warned that unemployment and insolvencies will rise, and the labor market could suffer “more long-term scars than expected.” Other threats include a no-deal Brexit at the end of the year and an “an excessive turning away from global production chains.”

526,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 02:26AM ET</span>","Currency crisis impoverishes Iranians, strains economic defenses","By Parisa Hafezi and Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Desperate to afford her daughter's overseas university fees, 58-year-old retired Iranian teacher Maryam Hosseini withdrew all her savings from the bank to buy U.S. dollars.
It was not enough. With three years of study still to do, her daughter is heading back home, her future now on hold.
Hosseini's tale of growing poverty is an increasingly familiar one among Iranians, who have long bought U.S. dollars to support their children financially or squirrel away savings.
""My daughter has to bury her dream of studying abroad and she has to come back. I cannot afford it anymore,"" Hosseini said.
The cause of Hosseini's misery was a sharp drop in the Iranian rial to its weakest against the U.S. dollar. The currency's fall has not only made life more expensive, it may also test Iran's ability to prop up an economy battered by crippling U.S. sanctions and the new coronavirus.
The dollar was being offered for 215,000 rials on Monday, according to website Bonbast.com, against an official rate of 42,000.
The currency plunge in recent weeks had forced the central bank to act, pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into the market to stabilise the rial. Central Bank Governor Abdolnasser Hemmatti described the interventions as ""wise and targeted"".
The bank had ample foreign reserves, he said, without disclosing their amount.
But current account and fiscal deficits brought on by the economic crisis may require tapping those reserves, weakening Iran's ability to curb rampant inflation, economists have said.
""They have limited foreign exchange reserves to inject in the market and will not be able to contain further depreciation in the presence of U.S. sanctions and isolation from the international community,"" said Garbis Iradian, chief economist for MENA at the Institute of International Finance.
ERODING RESERVES
The rial has lost about 70% of its value following the U.S. withdrawal from Iran's 2015 nuclear pact with six powers in 2018 and reimposition of sanctions.
The government has sought to compensate by creating several foreign exchange rates aimed in particular at easing the financial burden of importers.
But in the free market, the rial has continued its downward spiral, even after the latest central bank intervention.
Its recent fall is partly sentiment driven, coming after the U.N. nuclear watchdog urged Tehran to stop denying it access to two suspected former nuclear sites, and partly a result of a broader economic deterioration due to coronavirus. [nL8N2DW1QD]
But it might also signal a deeper shift.
""A more fundamental factor is the shift of the current account from a traditional surplus to a small deficit in 2020 due to the collapse in oil export revenues,"" said Niels de Hoog, economist at Atradius, a trade credit insurance firm.
He said the central bank was estimated to still have enough reserves to support the rial, but they were eroding as they were helping finance the budget deficit.
Hit by U.S. sanctions, oil exports are estimated at 100,000 to 200,000 barrels per day (bpd), down from more than 2.5 million bpd shipped in April 2018.
The International Monetary Fund estimates Iran will draw down nearly $20 billion of reserves this year to $85.2 billion and another $16 billion next year.
'POORER EVERY PASSING DAY'
The state budget deficit is estimated to hit $10 billion by March 2021, Tehran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture head Masoud Khansari was quoted as saying by media. He said growth in the budget deficit and money supply would bring higher inflation, a weaker rial and less purchasing power.
The government has asked Iranians not to flee the rial to buy foreign currency, and most traders in central Tehran exchange offices have been refusing to sell dollars, said trader Soroush in Tehran, who declined to give his full name.
""When the U.S. dollar started to gain value against the rial, people rushed to the exchange offices to buy dollars but now it is calm,"" he said.
But few now escape hardship. From the business elite to ordinary workers, most feel the impact of the sinking currency.
With rising taxes, falling subsidies, foreign markets limited by sanctions, and difficulty obtaining hard currency needed for trade, more and more businesses report problems.
""The currency crisis and trade sanctions have paralysed us. There is also a shortage of raw materials,"" said a furniture factory owner in the northern city of Rasht.
Prices of basic goods like bread, meat and rice increase daily. Meat is too dear for many, costing $10 a kilo. The media regularly report layoffs and strikes by workers who haven't been paid for months, including in government-owned factories.
""Life is very expensive. My salary is not enough to make ends meet. We are becoming poorer every passing day,"" said government employee Reza Mahmoudzadeh.
With inflation estimated at 34.2% this year, according to the IMF, most Iranians are braced for more price hikes.
Iran's clerical rulers want to prevent a revival of the unrest of Nov. 2019 that began over economic hardship but turned political, with protesters demanding top officials step down.

527,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 02:25AM ET</span>",Italian cabinet approves 'mother of all reforms' to slash red tape,"By Gavin Jones and Giuseppe Fonte
ROME (Reuters) - The Italian government approved a package of measures on Tuesday aimed at cutting the complicated red tape that has long been blamed for crimping growth in the euro zone's third-largest economy.
The ""simplification decree,"" approved after weeks of fraught political negotiation, has been touted by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte as ""the mother of all reforms"" to help relaunch an economy brought to its knees by the coronavirus.
It was approved in a preliminary version at a late night cabinet meeting, leaving some final details still to be hammered out.
The legislation, which runs to 174 pages in a draft seen by Reuters, covers a raft of sectors such as public tenders, digitalisation, rules for corporate capital increases and the criminal responsibility of public officials.
There have been many attempts by previous Italian governments to reduce red tape. In 2010 the former Minister for Simplification Roberto Calderoli famously made a bonfire of 375,000 regulations he claimed to have abolished from the statute books.
Yet, ordinary Italians and companies see little progress.
The World Bank's 2020 Ease of Doing Business survey, which considers bureaucratic obstacles to things like starting a business, paying taxes and enforcing contracts, ranked Italy 58th, well behind most European countries and losing ground for the second year in a row.
Conte's decree allows public bodies to assign small-scale work projects without using the tortuous public tender process, and it drastically simplifies procedures required even for larger projects worth up to 5.2 million euros ($5.88 million). The changes are initially valid only for the next 12 months.
It also tightens the definition of abuse of office, making it harder for public officials to be investigated for one of Italy's most commonly prosecuted white-collar crimes.
Officials sometimes block projects rather than risk investigation by signing off on something that may later fall foul of the law.
""We want to overcome the so-called fear of the signature,"" Conte told lawmakers this month.
These reforms sparked friction in the majority, with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement concerned they may favour corruption.
Keen to improve Italy's digitalisation, the decree streamlines procedures for the roll out of new fast broadband networks, and limits the current powers of mayors to oppose the installation of 5G mobile infrastructure, the draft said.
On corporate governance, it abolishes until the end of this year the requirement that the votes of two-thirds of shareholders be needed to approve capital increases.

528,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>",Investors in Russian bonds relaxed about extended Putin rule,"By Andrey Ostroukh and Karin Strohecker
MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - The prospect of President Vladimir Putin staying in the Kremlin until 2036 does not seem to be deterring buyers of Russia's high-yielding sovereign bonds as investors focus on economic fundamentals and political stability rather the risk of policy stagnation.
Investors in Russia are no strangers to shocks, having seen the country's markets roiled in recent years by sanctions and oil price collapses. 
Yet very little of this has taken the shine off rouble-denominated government debt - so-called OFZs - thanks to the Russia's low indebtedness, prudent monetary and fiscal rules and the world's fourth largest FX reserves. 
Now, constitutional changes that could extend the rule of Putin, who has been in power since 2000, as well as Moscow's plans to funds its post-pandemic recovery program have shone a fresh spotlight on the $135 billion OFZ market.
Few investors have expressed concern about Putin - who will turn 84 in 2036 - staying in power for so long, though this is not unusual for emerging markets where many prefer the stability of long-standing rulers to the ebb and flow of frequent policy change, as long as fiscal policy is sound.
""It's mixed news - on one hand you are always concerned when a leader is extending his time in office by hook or crook,"" said Kevin Daly, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments in London, whose firm holds OFZs.
""On the other hand you have to give credit where credit is due in terms of the fiscal management under his (Putin) leadership, which has been prudent."" 
Foreign investors currently hold $43 billion worth of OFZs or around a third of sovereign rouble bonds. 
Many enjoy the carry trade when they borrow dollars cheaply, convert them into roubles and invest in OFZs with yields of around 6% on a 10-year horizon (RU10YT=RR).
Russian interest rates are well above those measured by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s widely-tracked Government Bond Index Emerging Markets Global Diversified which hit an all-time low of 2.65%, according to analysts.
Graphic: Government bond yields of Russia, Brazil, Mexico and the United Statess https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgpdladnpo/GOVT%20bonds.jpg
And in a world where interest rates have plunged ever lower as policymakers around the globe try to kickstart economies flattened by the coronavirus pandemic, this is an attractive play for many. 
""Russian bonds are the only bonds I would buy now because they have high interest rates,"" veteran investor Jim Rogers (NYSE:ROG), who has invested in OFZs, told Reuters. 
Russia needs its investors on side: Moscow wants to double its OFZ sales to $71 billion to steer through the recession. And bond buyers seem happy enough to comply. 
A lengthy extension of Putin's rule did not seem to be a significant issue or the markets would have already repriced the risk, said Natasha Smirnova, sovereign portfolio manager for emerging markets fixed income at PineBridge Investments in London. 
""There are no immediate alternatives to Putin and he is still popular even though support has been declining with an understandable desire for new fresh faces."" 
Russian OFZs have become a mainstay for many international emerging market investors since it became possible for foreigners to settle the asset through Euroclear in 2012.
Western sanctions against Moscow or Russian individuals over annexation of Crimea in 2014 only temporarily dented the share of rouble government bonds held by foreigners. 
With the central bank recently switching to a more accommodative monetary policy stance - raising the prospect of more rate cuts - foreigners have bought into OFZ bonds before their prices go up, said a bond trader at a major western bank in Moscow.
The latest cut in Russia's key rate to an all-time low of 4.5% is not expected to see investors pull out of OFZs, central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said last month, adding she was confident that all $71 billion set by the finance ministry for this year will be raised. 
Graphic: Russia's OFZ landscape https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwpkalxjpm/OFZ-rate-inflation.jpg
Over the past 10 years almost all domestic political developments were a ""non-event"" for investors who pay more attention to sanctions, said Igor Burlakov, chief business officer at Sova Capital in London.
And while sanctions are the single biggest risk to Russian assets, investors have learned to look beyond them. 
""It is a permanent risk overhang, with occasional flare-ups, but the magnitude becomes smaller with each wave or yet another sanctions headline,"" said PineBridge's Smirnova.

Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe kept the cash rate and three-year yield target unchanged at 0.25%, as expected. Soaring job advertisements and retail sales suggest the economy is recovering, yet the outbreak of infections in Australia’s second-largest city is a stark reminder of ongoing risks.
“The downturn has been less severe than earlier expected” and conditions have stabilized recently, Lowe said in a statement after the meeting. “There has also been a pick-up in retail spending in response to the decline in infections and the easing of restrictions in most of the country.”
The RBA is leaning on fiscal authorities to keep injecting stimulus into the economy to cover the retreat in private activity. Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s government will deliver an economic statement July 23 that will outline ongoing support and where it intends to let programs expire.
New South Wales and Victoria, the nation’s most populous and economically powerful states, will close their border tonight as Victorian authorities battle to contain Melbourne’s worst spike in coronavirus cases since the crisis began.
While Australia has been one of the standout performers globally in limiting the spread of the virus to less than 9,000 cases, Victoria’s flare-up shows just how hard it is to eradicate without a vaccine, as Lowe himself has warned.
Australia’s economy lost more than 800,000 jobs in April and May and the unemployment rate hit 7.1%, with Treasury expecting it to reach 8% this quarter. The government’s JobKeeper program, which pays a wage subsidy to keep workers attached to firms, has been instrumental in containing the jobless rate. The program is due to expire in September and its fate will be closely watched in the Morrison government’s July statement.
Australia’s relative success in flattening the infection curve and its yield-control program have proved attractive to investors, particularly given the more expansive measures taken by many other central banks. The Australian dollar has soared about 20% since March 19, when the RBA announced its emergency measures.
When questioned on the currency last month, Lowe said it’s hard to argue the exchange rate is overvalued given the relative health and economic struggles of some other countries.
Still, by Australian standards the economy is battling. It has endured the first recession since 1991 and 8% unemployment would be the highest this century. On top of that, ties with China, Australia’s key trading partner, have been tense since Morrison called for an international inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - As soon as Hong Kong's new national security law came into force last week, Ivan Ng removed all the protest-themed paintings, posters and flags from the list of items for sale at his Onestep Printing shop. 
Sandra Leung at Wefund.hk, which sells protest-themed artwork and accessories, said she has suspended sales of protective gear worn by protesters, flags with the slogan ""Liberate Hong Kong,"" and other items carrying popular chants.
Jeffrey Cheong, owner of Hair Guys Salon, said he closed his shop down for a few days last week to remove pro-democracy decorations.
Ng, Leung and Cheong are three of the 4,500 or so small businesses in Hong Kong's ""yellow economy,"" which supports pro-democracy protesters and vice versa. That circle of support is showing signs of weakening in the face of the new law. 
""We took down all the protest-related products right after the law was implemented, because the law doesn’t have very clear boundaries of (what constitutes) subversion,"" Ng said. In the past week, he said his overall sales are down as much as 80%.
Leung said she had withdrawn items for sale she described as ""sensitive,"" such as gas masks used by protesters and items with anti-police slogans.
The new law prohibits what China describes broadly as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with up to life in prison for offenders. It came into force late last Tuesday, about an hour before the 23rd anniversary of China taking back control of the former British colony.
The Hong Kong government went further on Friday, declaring the popular protest slogan ""Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times"" illegal. Public libraries have started to review books written by pro-democracy activists to see whether they violate the new law.
LENNON WALLS GO
Hong Kong and Beijing authorities insist the city retains a ""high degree of autonomy"" but critics say the law effectively brings Hong Kong under the control of China's Communist Party and violates China's promise to safeguard Hong Kong's freedom for 50 years after the 1997 handover.
Some businesses told local media they had been visited by the police who warned them that pro-democracy decorations were against the new law. Hong Kong police declined to disclose details of any such visits. In a statement to Reuters, a police representative said the objective of any enforcement action was not to target flags or slogans, but to ""interdict people's behavior on inciting and/or abetting others for the commission of secession or subversion."" 
With or without police visits, many shops run by pro-democracy sympathizers have in the past week taken down their so-called Lennon Walls, the mosaics of colored Post-it notes with protest messages left by customers, named after the John Lennon Wall in communist-controlled Prague that was covered with Beatles lyrics and messages of political grievance.
The absence of these eye-catching features will make it harder to spot which shops support the pro-democracy movement. The same is true on the web. 
An online platform called ""Eat With You"" that compiles lists of yellow shops and blue shops - whose owners are perceived to be pro-Beijing - deactivated last week. Another, hkshoplist.com, has taken down the reasons why it listed shops as yellow.
Some are finding new ways to stay in touch with their pro-democracy customers, such as putting up mosaics of blank Post-its and replacing posters with plain A4 sheets of paper. 
One shop selling ice cream and drinks has taken down protest-themed decorations and updated its menu with fake patriotic slogans, hoping customers will appreciate the satire. ""We must drink for the members of the Communist Party and people who love our country!"" and ""Special drinks for socialism with Chinese characteristics!"" are two examples. 

""The national security law is suppressing our freedom of speech,"" said Selina Leung, 26, the manager of the shop called Talk 2 DeCream. ""Rather than violating the law, we are trying to have fun during this hardship.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The World Bank and International Monetary Fund will hold their annual Fall Meetings online in October because of the novel coronavirus pandemic, World Bank President David Malpass said in a letter to the Bank's governors.
Malpass also encouraged those countries that are considering appointing new executive directors to represent them on the Bank's boards to factor gender diversity into their decisions. Only five of 25 current directors are women, he said.
The decision to meet virtually, rather than in person in Washington, was widely expected given rising infections in the United States, and continuing travel restrictions. 
The two international finance institutions also held their Spring Meetings online in April, and IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and other officials have said they expect to shift more of their work to virtual meetings in the future.
In his letter, posted on the LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) business networking site, Malpass underscored the Bank's commitment to addressing the economic impact of the pandemic and helping developing countries take steps toward recovery.
""The COVID-19 crisis and economic shutdown threaten to reverse much of the development progress made in recent years and throw hundreds of millions of people back into poverty,"" Malpass wrote. 
He said the Bank had approved emergency health projects in over 100 countries and was providing working capital and trade finance for the private sector in developing countries. 
The Bank's preliminary and unaudited commitments in fiscal 2020 would likely total about $74 billion, up sharply from fiscal 2019, with total financing in the 15 months ending June 30, 2021, to reach as high as $160 billion, he wrote.

Malpass called again for additional steps to help some of the poorest countries deal with unsustainable debt burdens, in addition to an offer by the Group of 20 major economies to freeze debt-service payments through the end of the year.

534,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 07:20PM ET</span>","An end to Australia's apartment binge looms over jobs, growth","By Swati Pandey and Sam Holmes
SYDNEY (Reuters) - The hit to Australia's population growth from closing its international borders is quickly turning a long-running housing shortage into a glut, bringing an end to the apartment building boom behind much of the country's recent prosperity.
Since 2000, Australia has added about 6 million to its population, more than six times the growth seen in Germany, with most of that coming from immigration.
That fueled huge demand for housing construction, much of it smaller dwellings in larger, higher-density urban blocks, not just the bungalows on sprawling plots for which Australian suburbs are better known.
With Australia's borders likely to remain closed until the coronavirus pandemic is successfully contained, a heavy decline in construction, which accounts for roughly 10% of all jobs and economic activity, is set to push unemployment higher and hurt businesses both up and downstream.
Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Partridge, managing director of Brickworks, a building materials company, sees the pipeline for big multi-unit housing developments drying up as immigration stalls and non-permanent residents depart.
""We are seeing quite high vacancy rates emerging,"" Partridge told Reuters. ""A lot of the people who were renting apartments are going home.""
Sydney, the biggest city, is experiencing the worst residential vacancy rate in the country at over 16% in May from between 4% and 5% late last year, according to SQM research.
Since 2014, higher density housing has accounted for about 43% of residential construction, more than double the proportion during the 1980s. Significant demand has come from the massive influx of foreign students who make up about 40% of Australia's immigration intake.
In May, the number of higher density homes approved for construction fell 34.9% to a near eight-year low, data showed last week. Economists see further declines ahead.
BIS Oxford expects construction starts for high rise apartments to fall to just 21,500 in the year to June 2021, down by two-thirds from five years ago.
To head off the expected shock, the central bank has slashed borrowing rates to record lows. State and federal governments have brought forward massive public works spending and offered grants for home alterations.
There are also hopes that demand for houses in areas outside the major cities might pick up as employers increasingly embrace remote working arrangements.

PIPELINE PLUNGE COMING
Compared with the thousands of deaths in other countries, Australia has managed to keep its outbreak well contained with just over 100 fatalities. While its economy has entered its first recession in three decades, the contraction is less acute than most of its rich world peers.
Unlike the services industry, where hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost, the hit to construction has so far been mild.
Still, policymakers are deeply worried about that changing as builders approach a plunge in the project pipeline over the next 12 months.
""Looking ahead, most contacts expect to continue to adjust their workforce in some format because of the uncertain outlook for construction activity,"" the central bank noted in an internal research released under FOI in late May.
Also darkening the outlook are Australia's increasingly strained ties with China, one of its biggest sources of immigration.
That has raised uncertainty over not only the timing of a recovery, but also whether the market will return to the heady demand of the past decade.
Morris Property Group last month shelved a 345-unit apartment development in Australia's capital, Canberra, due to the collapse in demand as borders closed.
Situated near the Australian National University, the project was geared to meet housing needs for international students, mainly Chinese and Indian, who would ordinarily populate the district.
Barry Morris, the group's director, says the cancellation means some 300 construction jobs will no longer be needed.
Even when construction becomes viable again, Morris does not expect demand to support a project of the scale planned and says it could end up being closer to 150 units.

""When we are ready, we will redesign it and it will probably need to be smaller,"" Morris said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A high-profile pandemic aid program protected about 51.1 million American jobs, the Trump administration said on Monday, as it revealed how $521.4 billion in taxpayer cash was injected into small businesses but also into the pockets of the rich and famous.
The data on the small business Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) seemed to confirm worries among Democrats and watchdog groups that in addition to mom-and-pop shops, the funds went to well-heeled and politically-connected companies, some of which were approved for between $5 million and $10 million.
Those include several firms that lobby on public policy, such as Wiley Rein LLP and APCO Worldwide, as well as prominent law firms like Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP, which has represented President Donald Trump, and Boies Schiller Flexner LLP.
Kasowitz Benson Torres said the funding helped the law firm preserve hundreds of jobs at full salary at a time when federal courts and its offices were shut down.
The gallery of well-connected names extended deeply into the world of America's privileged and super famous.
Sidwell Friends School, an exclusive private school which educated former President Barack Obama's daughters, was approved for between $5 million and $10 million, as was Saint Ann’s School in Brooklyn, which - with tuition exceeding $50,000 per year - is attended by the children of hedge fund managers and celebrities.
Newsmax Media Inc, the media company run by Trump donor Christopher Ruddy, got the nod for between $2 million and $5 million. So did billionaire rapper Kanye West's Yeezy LLC clothing company. Newsmax said in a statement it was eligible for the program and did receive a loan, but declined to elaborate.
Aside from Kasowitz Benson Torres and Newsmax, the other companies and schools did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""The initial data is revealing many recipients that are appropriately raising eyebrows, which was one of the many reasons we wanted it public,"" said Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight.
DETAILED PICTURE
The colossal data set released by the U.S. Treasury Department and Small Business Administration (SBA), after initial resistance, gives Americans their first full look at who got cash from the first-come-first-served PPP that has been dogged by technology, paperwork and fairness issues.
To date, the SBA has released geographical distribution figures but the new data paints a much more detailed picture of which communities and sub-sectors received support. Senior administration officials hailed the program as a ""wild success,"" with the data showing it supported about 84% of all small business employees.
The data includes information on 660,000 loans of $150,000 or more, including recipient name, address, lender, business type, jobs retained, and some demographic information. That accounts for roughly 73% of the dollars granted, but only 14% of the 4.9 million loans, according to a summary of data the agencies released on Monday.
While the data does not say exactly how much money each borrower received, they are placed in one of five bands: $150,000-350,000; $350,000-1 million; $1-2 million; $2-5 million; and $5-10 million. More than 4,800 loans were issued in the top band, while the overall average loan size was $107,000, the data shows.
Among those in the mix: the Americans for Tax Reform Foundation, whose stated mission is to curb government spending. It was approved for a loan of between $150,000 and $350,000.
Despite some eyebrow-raising recipients, the funds reached a wide swath of businesses - more than $67 billion for the healthcare and social assistance sector, $64 billion-plus for construction businesses, $54 billion for manufacturing and, at the smaller end, more than $7 billion for religious organizations, the data showed.
LINGERING QUESTIONS
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had initially refused to name any recipients, saying it could expose borrowers' proprietary business information. But under pressure from lawmakers, he agreed to shine a light on large borrowers.
Launched in April, the unprecedented program - which has been extended until Aug. 8 - allows small businesses hurt by the pandemic to apply for a forgivable government-backed loan from a lender.
More than 5,000 U.S. lenders participated in the program, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) accounting for $29 billion in loans. JPMorgan, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Truist Bank, PNC Bank and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) originated 17% of total PPP loans, according to the data.
In the scramble to distribute funds, the program was beset by technology glitches, documentation snags and revelations that some lenders prioritized their most profitable clients.
Some investment firms, for example, were also on the list.
That included Advent Capital Management LLC, a New York-based debt investor with $9 billion in assets; Metacapital Management LP, a New York-based fixed income investor with more than $1 billion in assets; and Semper Capital Management LP, which invests nearly $4 billion in mortgage-backed securities.
Deepak Narula, the head of Metacapital, said his company decided it did not want the money and returned it ""pretty quickly."" A spokesperson for Advent said the company explored but never completed an application and did not receive any funds. Semper did not respond to a request for comment.
Monday's data is likely to raise further questions over whether the most needy benefited from the program and whether more companies should have returned the cash.
Roughly $30 billion in loans have already been returned or canceled, a senior administration official said. Those include loans taken by large or publicly listed companies which attracted fierce criticism for breaching the spirit of the rules, as well as loans issued to companies that decided they did not want or need the money after all.
The data shows loans that have been approved, but it does not say how much was disbursed, nor which loans have been forgiven so far. The loans were largely dished out on a good-faith basis, with borrowers certifying to their eligibility and the accuracy of the data they provided, meaning the figures on how many jobs were retained have not been thoroughly vetted.
Loans that appear to breach the letter or spirit of the rules may not be forgiven, and the Treasury plans to conduct a full review of loans of more than $2 million.

The Department of Justice has already brought charges against several PPP borrowers for fraudulently seeking loans, while several federal and state regulators are also probing misuse of the funds.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As Congress signed off on trillions of dollars in coronavirus aid, the small-government group Citizens Against Government Waste urged lawmakers to oppose bailouts for U.S. states, broadcasters, unemployed people and other recipients.
The group also secured at least $150,000 in government funds for itself, records released on Monday show.
The nonprofit was one of dozens of firms in Washington's lucrative influence industry to tap the Paycheck Protection Program, a $660 billion fund approved by Congress to aid small businesses during the COVID-19 crisis, despite rules meant to prevent federal dollars being used for lobbying or political activities.
The Trump administration said on Monday the PPP program helped protect 51.1 million jobs.
Records show that Citizens Against Government Waste got a loan of between $150,000 and $350,000 to keep 17 workers employed. The group did not respond to a request for comment.
Other beneficiaries include law firms that have earned hundreds of thousands of dollars from lobbying Congress, think tanks, political consulting shops, advocacy groups and groups that work closely with lawmakers, such as the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation.
That came despite a rule dating back to 1996 that bars the Small Business Administration from making loans to businesses ""primarily"" engaged in politics or lobbying.
A federal judge upheld the rule in April.
Law firms Wiley Rein and Kasowitz Benson Torres both received loans of at least $5 million, SBA records show. Wiley Rein earned $660,000 in lobbying fees in the first three months of 2020 and Kasowitz earned $310,000 during that time, according to Senate records.
Those revenues represent a fraction of the more than $200 million each firm earned last year.
Kasowitz said in a statement that the PPP funds enabled it to keep paying employees at a time when courts were shut down. Wiley Rein did not respond to a request for comment.
Citizens Against Government Waste was not the only small-government group to win bailout loans, records show.
Americans for Tax Reform, which advocates for lower taxes, said its separate research arm took out a PPP loan because it had been badly hurt by government restrictions on business.
The group said it did not oppose the program because it viewed it as compensation for the drop in revenue caused by government-ordered business shutdowns.
Citizens United, which led a successful effort to roll back restrictions on money in politics, also said that a PPP loan went to its affiliated Citizens United Foundation.

537,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 04:45PM ET</span>",A Forgotten Trade Spat With Canada Is Costing U.S. Homebuilders,"(Bloomberg) -- As a wave of pent-up homebuying emerges across the U.S., a pesky and oft-forgotten trade dispute with Canada is boosting building costs.
A long-simmering spat between the U.S. and Canada over softwood lumber is adding to the expenses homebuilders face in the fallout from disruptions related to the coronavirus pandemic, said David Logan, director of tax and trade policy analysis for the Washington-based National Association of Home Builders. Lumber mills in the Pacific Northwest cut production amid lockdowns, and builders are buying more wood from Canada, he said.
Canadian producers are paying average tariffs of more than 20% on timber shipments to the U.S., and that translates into an average price increase of about 8% in the U.S., Logan said. Construction is topping forecasts, and builders will be forced to absorb the additional expenses, he said. Framing lumber accounts for as much as a fifth of the material costs of erecting a home.
“The majority of homebuilders in America are truly small businesses, building fewer than 10 homes a year,” Logan said in a telephone interview. “So the effects that the pandemic has had on the economy make it a lot more difficult for builders to absorb those costs.”
Lumber futures have soared more 70% from a four-year low on April 1. Supplies tightened at a time when people stuck at home spent more time on repairs and improvements.
The Trump administration slapped punitive tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber in 2017, saying the industry is unfairly subsidized. While the move supports U.S. producers, it adds to costs for domestic builders who get more than a quarter of their lumber from north of the border.
The odds are low that the Canada-U.S. fight will be settled this year. The Trump administration has focused on trade disputes with China, and prices are strong, said Kevin Mason, managing director of Vancouver-based ERA Forest Products Research.
“This thing is dead as a doornail for 2020,” Mason said in a phone interview. “This year, there’s just no hope of anything getting negotiated.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and over 40 trade associations on Monday urged top American and Chinese officials to redouble efforts to implement a Phase 1 trade agreement signed by the world's two largest economies in January despite pandemic-related strains.
In a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, the groups said they were encouraged by the progress so far, but urged a significant increase in China's purchases of U.S. goods and services.
They said combating the novel coronavirus pandemic and restoring global growth depended in part on successful implementation of the U.S.-China trade deal, which helped defuse a nearly 18-month trade war marked by tit-for-tat tariffs.
The agreement called for China to purchase $200 billion in additional U.S. goods and services over the next two years.
Jeremie Waterman, who heads the Chamber's China Center, said some progress had been made on structural issues and purchases of farm goods, but China needed to step up its purchases of U.S. manufactured goods, services and energy to meet its targets now that its economy was starting to recover from the pandemic.
""There are areas where we see less progress and where we think it's critical that both sides redouble efforts,"" Waterman said. 
U.S.-China tensions have spiked in recent months over the origins of the coronavirus outbreak and passage of a new national security law that limits Hong Kong's autonomy.
U.S. President Donald Trump had said that ""decoupling"" the two economies remains an option, and his trade adviser Peter Navarro jolted markets last month when he said the U.S.-China trade agreement was ""over,"" although he quickly backtracked.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said on Monday the U.S. president was considering several executive orders targeting China and manufacturing, but gave no details.
The U.S. industry groups listed specific recommendations in an annex to the letter, including increased purchases of U.S. aircraft and components, cars and medical devices, as well as cloud services and U.S. energy products.
Accelerated implementation of the trade deal would help both countries while paving the way for Phase 2 talks on other key issues such as subsidies, cybersecurity and digital trade, they said.

""Amid increasing bilateral tensions across the relationship, working together to improve trade and grow commerce can provide important benefits to both economies and help to improve relations,"" they wrote in the letter.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service is expecting Canadian provinces to shift rapidly to stabilizing their rising debt burdens once economic growth resumes, which analysts said could be a signal to provinces on how they can avoid downgrades.
The ratings agency said on Monday it expected Canada's economy to contract by 7% in 2020 because of the coronavirus crisis and all 10 provinces to post ""material deficits"" in the fiscal year that began in April.
That includes an expected deficit of more than 30% of revenue for Alberta, which faces the additional challenge of low oil prices. Fitch downgraded Alberta's rating last week to AA- from AA.
Declining growth will lead to a sharp increase in debt burdens for the provinces this fiscal year, Moody's said. But the ratings agency sees debt loads stabilizing in 2021-22 as revenue recovers, which could indicate it is in no rush to downgrade the provinces' debt.
Moody's report signals ""to the extent that the provincial governments return quickly to fiscal consolidation, they will not view the temporary deviation as credit negative,"" said Maria Berlettano, head of Canadian government credit strategy at CIBC Capital Markets.
Less than two weeks ago, Canada's sovereign debt lost one of its coveted triple-A ratings when Fitch downgraded it for the first time, citing expected much higher public debt ratios. Moody's still gives Canada its highest rating of Aaa.
At over C$800 billion ($590 billion), provincial bonds outstanding exceed federal government issuance.
""Our view would be that provincial finances are shouldering much less of the COVID burden than the federal government,"" said Robert Kavcic, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. ""We are expecting the combined provincial deficit at about 3% of GDP this year, versus more than 11% for Ottawa.""

Lawmakers in the trade committee of the European Parliament voted by 32 to three to extend the powers of the 27-nation bloc and deter other countries from breaching global trading rules.
""We cannot let a country hit us illegally and unilaterally without us being able to react immediately. We have to make sure that everyone adheres to the rules of international trade,"" said Marie-Pierre Vedrenne, the lawmaker in charge of the file.
EU trade chief Phil Hogan earlier on Monday said the recent launch of a series of new U.S. trade investigations was totally unacceptable.
The proposal could be watered down after negotiations with EU governments, but clearly signals a willingness in Brussels to get tougher on trade. 
For 25 years, the World Trade Organization has intervened in trade disputes, with decision by a three-person panel subject to possible appeals to the WTO's Appellate Body.
However, the United States has blocked appointments to the Appellate Body, complaining it has overreached its mandate, and left it with too few members to rule.
The EU and 15 other countries including Canada and China have set up a temporary arbitration system that will hear appeals while the WTO's Appellate Body is frozen. 
However, those not in the group, such as the United States, could launch appeals and push cases into a legal void.
The European Commission has proposed the European Union should be able to take counter-measures if another country imposes illegal trade measures and then blocks settlement of the dispute. 

Under the lawmakers' proposal, the EU would be able to retaliate even before an initial WTO panel ruling, earlier than envisaged in the initial European Commission proposal.

(Reuters) - An elite law firm founded by trial lawyer David Boies was approved for up to $10 million in federal aid under a loan program designed to help struggling businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to data released Monday by the Small Business Administration.
Boies Schiller Flexner, a top U.S. law firm where partners commonly earn seven-figure compensation, is known for representing Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein against sexual-assault accusations, and companies ranging from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to Theranos. The firm was approved to receive between $5 million to $10 million under the U.S. government's Paycheck Protection Program.
Boies Schiller managing partners Nicholas Gravante and Natasha Harrison did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Boies Schiller was among several law firms, including Wiley Rein, Thompson & Knight and Kasowitz Benson Torres, that were approved to receive PPP loans. Representatives for those firms did not immediately respond to request for comment. Law firms have been hard hit by the pandemic, which dried up deal and trial work as courts and businesses closed. The legal sectory in April lost 68,000 jobs, according to Labor Department data.
Reuters reported in April that the managing partners asked shareholder partners to authorize the firm to seek up to $20 million in forgivable government loans, two sources familiar with said. That request had caused concern among some of the firm’s members, the two sources said.
Boies Schiller does not disclose its financial information, but last year its shareholder partners earned an average of more than $3 million, according to the American Lawyer.
Founded in 1997, Boies Schiller has about 245 lawyers in the United States and United Kingdom, according to the firm’s website. In 2019, the firm grossed $405 million, according to the American Lawyer. At least some of its partners bill more than $1,000 an hour, a source familiar with the firm said.
Boies, the firm’s chairman, is well-known for representing the U.S. government in antitrust litigation against  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and former Vice President Al Gore in the U.S. Supreme Court case over the 2000 presidential election recount. He more recently advised failed blood-testing startup Theranos and Weinstein, who was convicted of sexual assault and rape in a New York court in February.
Since January, more than 30 partners have left the firm, Reuters has reported. Leaders of the firm have said many of the departures are tied to an internal restructuring.
To apply for a loan, applicants must certify that they need the cash to cover basic needs such as salaries and rent and that “current economic uncertainty makes this loan necessary to support” ongoing operations. With some exceptions, companies have to have 500 or fewer employees to be eligible.

543,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>",Argentina's sweetened debt offer wins initial praise; bonds jump,"By Marc Jones and Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Argentina's new debt restructuring offer won a tentative thumbs up from creditors as they digested the details on Monday, pumping up the country's bonds on hopes the two sides could strike a deal by an extended Aug. 4 deadline.
Two prominent funds, Gramercy and FinTech, quickly said they would back the deal, though there was no immediate sign of whether it would gain the blessing of the biggest bloc of creditors including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Fidelity.
Argentina laid out an improved and ""final"" offer on Sunday that increased creditors' payments, shortened their wait time, and changed key legal clauses that had become a source of tension.
The revised offer, set to be formalized with U.S. regulators, came after tensions flared with two major creditor groups and talks stalled in mid-June, as the grains powerhouse was battered by the coronavirus pandemic.
""Considering everything that the country is going through, it looks to like a fairly good offer,"" said Alejandro Hardziej at bondholder Pala Asset Management. He added that creditors might have liked a ""GDP warrant"" for extra payments if economic growth improves.
A deal is key for Argentina avoiding a messy and protracted legal standoff that could lock the country out of international markets and drag it further into recession.
""We look forward to supporting Argentina's offer as it provides ... debt sustainability that is crucial for durable, high and inclusive economic growth,"" Gramercy and FinTech said in a joint statement.
Under the proposal, Argentina would start making payments in one year versus three in its original offer in April. Coupon payments start low but could rise to around 5%.
""The valuation gap with the latest bondholder proposals has shrunk considerably,"" analysts at U.S. investment bank Citi said in a note, calculating the gap at 4-5 cents on the dollar.
The bank expected a ""sizable"" proportion of investors holding the 'exchange' bonds that were restructured last time Argentina defaulted to sign up to the deal, as the government had backed away from eroding their legal rights.
There might not be such high take up, however, from those with bonds sold under the country's previous President Mauricio Macri, as their replacement bonds would be issued under terms which offer less legal protection.
DEAL RISK
Siobhan Morden at Amherst Pierpont said in a note the offer was ""reasonable"" and calculated its value at 53 cents on the dollar at an exit yield of 10%. She added, however, that the lack of an accord previously with key bondholder groups was a hurdle.
""There is still deal risk as this last phase was not negotiated with the Ad Hoc and Exchange Bondholder joint group,"" she said, adding that the pair, which together hold around $21 billion of the total eligible bonds, could still block a deal.
""It's a higher risk strategy to go ahead with a final offer without majority bondholder consent.""
The two groups did not respond to requests for comment.
Hardziej said he hoped the two sides would be able to reach an agreement given the ""small difference"" between the latest proposals.

""We hope that this is the last offer and we hope it works,"" he said.

544,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",Trump Administration Discloses $521.5 Billion in Virus Aid,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration released details of almost 4.9 million loans to businesses – from sole proprietors to restaurant and hotel chains – under the federal government’s largest coronavirus relief program so far, the $669 billion Paycheck Protection Program.
The data, including the names of the program’s biggest borrowers, were posted Monday morning on the website of the Small Business Administration, which ran the program with the Treasury Department. The data can be found here.
The disclosures, which come after members of Congress and others voiced concern about the level of transparency surrounding the PPP, don’t provide full details for any loans. Names of companies that borrowed less than $150,000 – a group that comprises the vast majority of the program’s borrowers – weren’t made public. And larger borrowers’ loans were disclosed only in broad ranges of values, such as $5 million to $10 million.
The program, passed hurriedly by Congress in March, was designed to provide small firms with loans of as much as $10 million, based on a company’s average monthly payroll before the pandemic. The loans can become grants if borrowers use the proceeds mostly to pay workers -- with some spending allowed for rent and overhead costs. Almost from the beginning, the PPP was dogged by controversy as some publicly traded firms tapped it. Many returned PPP loans after their borrowing drew criticism.
The program’s supporters say it has kept tens of millions of workers employed during the pandemic and contributed to the surprising 2.5 million U.S. jobs added in May, with an additional 4.8 million jobs in June. The SBA and Treasury said borrowers reported that PPP loans supported 51.1 million jobs, or as much as 84% of all small business employees before the pandemic. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said the program supported at least 72% of the small business payroll in all 50 states.
Program Extended
Monday’s release reflects loans totaling almost $521.5 billion, which were approved between the launch of the program on April 3 and June 30, when the SBA temporarily stopped accepting new applications. Congress voted last week to extend the program until Aug. 8, and it reopened Monday morning.
Mnuchin had drawn opposition from transparency advocates for initially refusing to disclose names of companies that received PPP loans, saying the information is proprietary because loan amounts are based on borrowers’ payrolls. The administration relented after demands from lawmakers and agreed to release certain information while withholding other details.
For those loans below $150,000, the agencies are disclosing specific loan amounts along with industry codes, ZIP codes, number of jobs supported and other data -- but no personally identifiable borrower information.
Meanwhile, SBA and Treasury officials said they provided access to the full data to congressional committees that have demanded it. Personally identifiable information in the data shared with Congress will be treated as confidential, according to letters the SBA and Treasury sent to the committees last month.
Critics want to see which larger firms and chains took PPP loans after reports that entities such as  Shake Shack Inc  (NYSE:SHAK). and the Los Angeles Lakers got loans ahead of mom and pop borrowers, prompting those two and others to return their loans. The public outcry spurred the Trump administration to promise to review all loans greater than $2 million and to tell companies that had access to other sources of capital that they likely didn’t qualify for the bailout program.
Loans Returned
Public companies returned almost 70 loans totaling $436.5 million as of Monday morning, according to data compiled by FactSquared, but SBA and Treasury have not disclosed how many loans in all, including from closely held firms, were repaid. About $38.5 billion in coronavirus relief loans for small businesses were canceled as of the end of May, according to a U.S. Government Accountability Office report, but officials said they will not be reporting details of returned and canceled loans.
News reports on the program have disclosed that members of Congress have taken or benefited from PPP loans, as well as firms that have reported significant revenue, closed facilities or filed for bankruptcy protection after getting PPP assistance. Some small-business owners sued large banks, accusing the lenders of prioritizing large loans for favored customers at the expense of the smallest firms that sought funding.
As part of Monday’s disclosures, federal officials have indicated that they’d release demographic data related to the loans – though officials said the information is limited because it’s based on what lenders asked borrowers to provide voluntarily. The SBA’s inspector general had criticized the agency in a May report for failing to collect standard demographic information on applications for loans that would have allowed it to prioritize loans for businesses owned by minorities, women and veterans, as well as for those in rural areas, as Congress intended.
Trump administration officials have said that by revealing names for the biggest borrowers, Monday’s disclosure accounts for about three-fourths of the total dollar amount in loans approved. But critics say that’s deceptive because almost 87% of all the loans were for amounts less than $150,000. The average loan size was about $107,000, SBA and Treasury said.
Almost 3.3 million loans, or 67% of the total, were for amounts of $50,000 or less, data released by SBA and Treasury as of June 30 show. They made up 11% of the total amount lent. At the other extreme, more than 4,800 loans were for more than $5 million, accounting for less than 1% of the number of transactions and almost 7% of the amount lent, data show.
Companies in the health care and social assistance industry accounted for the largest amount in loans at $67.4 billion, followed by professional, scientific and technical services firms at $66.4 billion; construction at $64.6 billion; manufacturing at $54 billion; and accommodation and food services at $42.1 billion, according to the data released.
California, Florida, Texas, New York and Illinois had the largest numbers of loans and the most in dollar amount approved, data show.
There were 5,461 lenders who participated in the program, with large banks that have more than $50 billion in assets accounting for 36% of the dollar amount, and lenders with less than $10 billion approving 44%, according to the data. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) had the largest amount of new dollars approved at $29.1 billion, or 4.4% of the total, followed by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) at $25.2 billion.
The SBA was overwhelmed by initial demand for the loans, and the initial $349 billion in funding was exhausted in just 13 days. Demand waned after Congress approved a second round of $320 billion, and almost $132 billion remained -- after bank fees and processing costs -- as of June 30, according to SBA and Treasury. Proposals to repurpose the funds for small firms that still need aid are expected to be debated in negotiations for an additional round of stimulus later this month.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston said on Monday the Main Street Lending Program is now fully operational and ready to purchase eligible loans.
The Main Street lending facility, which opened for lender registration in mid-June, is meant to extend easy credit to small and mid-sized businesses that cannot get it elsewhere.
The Fed encouraged registered lenders to start submitting qualifying loans. The U.S. central bank also announced it intends to publish a state-by-state listing of registered lenders that are accepting new business customers under the program and that choose to be listed.  
Lenders had still not made any loans under the program as of July 1, according to data released by the Fed last week. 
Large financial institutions that work closely with the Fed, known as primary dealers, slashed in half their expectations for how much take-up they expect from the Main Street lending program, according to a survey released last week by the New York Fed.
It is not entirely clear why the loans have not drawn more interest. When the Fed first proposed it, staff worked urgently on standing it up as thousands of letters poured in with suggestions for how to make it more useful and questions about where to find participating lenders.
The central bank tweaked its plan in response to many of those suggestions by lowering the minimum loan amount, making the program available to a wider range of businesses and introducing a proposal that would open it up to nonprofit groups. 

So far 300 lenders have signed up to participate, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week. He also indicated the Fed was open to making further adjustments to the program.

""It's dealing with a number of executive orders that may go all the way from dealing with some of the immigration issues that we have before us, to some of the manufacturing and jobs issues that are before us, and ultimately dealing with China, in what we need to do there in terms of resetting that balance,"" Meadows said.
Since taking office in 2017, Trump has tried to rescind a program that shields from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants living in the United States illegally after entering as children - a group often called ""Dreamers.""
The U.S. Supreme Court last month blocked Trump’s effort to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy put in place by former President Barack Obama, which protects roughly 649,000 immigrants from deportation.

A trade dispute dating back to 2004 over subsidies for Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) and U.S. planemaker Boeing (N:BA) is drawing to a conclusion at the World Trade Organization (WTO).
It has already awarded Washington the right to impose duties on $7.5 billion of European goods related to subsidies given to Airbus (PA:AIR) but is only expected to rule in September what retaliation Europe can take over support for Boeing.
European Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan told the European Parliament's trade committee that Washington had twice rejected EU proposals to settle the dispute and he hoped the WTO would issue its findings as soon as possible in September.
EU officials said they did not expect the United States to want to settle the dispute before then.
""I want to reassure people that we are ready to act decisively and strongly on the European Union side if we don't get the type of outcome that we expect from the United States in relationship to finalising this 15-year-old dispute,"" he said.
Since U.S. President Donald Trump took office, he has repeatedly criticised the European Union over its trade surplus in goods and imposed tariffs on metal imports from the EU and threatened to do the same for cars made in the bloc.
Hogan said Washington's recent launch of several ""Section 232"" investigations, which assess the impact of imports on U.S. national security, was unacceptable.
The investigations cover mobile cranes and transformers and have been expanded to include steel products, such as nails. The United States is also looking into whether planned EU digital services taxes impede U.S. commerce.
""It's not appreciated the number of 232 investigations that have been launched in recent weeks, perhaps this is political, perhaps it's more real,"" Hogan said.

""This is totally unacceptable ... and if these investigations go further the European Union will have to stand together and act as well,"" he said.

550,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Indonesia unveils $40 billion bond scheme to fund recovery from pandemic,"By Tabita Diela and Fransiska Nangoy
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank has agreed to buy a total 574.59 trillion rupiah ($39.74 billion) of low-yielding government bonds this year to help fund the economic recovery programme, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Monday.
The bond-buying programme will help finance the 2020 fiscal deficit, which is forecast to reach 6.34% of GDP this year, more than triple an initial plan of 1.76%, as the government steps up spending to fight the virus outbreak while revenue drops.
Some 397.56 trillion rupiah of bonds will be used to finance public interest programmes and the cost will be fully borne by the central bank, Indrawati said. The rest will carry interest rates below the central bank's 3-month reverse repurchase rate and will be used to support recovery schemes for some businesses, she said.
""This policy is aimed at invoking confidence in our economic recovery, healthcare response and to create more certainty,"" Indrawati said.
The bond scheme will be a one-off policy and the debt tradeable, which will allow Bank Indonesia (BI) to utilise them for its monetary operation, she added.
BI Governor Perry Warjiyo told reporters the scheme will have a small impact on this year's inflation, which hit a 20-year low in June due to weak demand, while BI will continue to assess the impact on future inflation and rupiah exchange rate.
Warjiyo added that the scheme will not have any implication to monetary policy.
""Our capital is strong and it will not affect how BI conducts our monetary policy according to the framework that we have established for years,"" he said.
BI has intensified its ""quantitative easing"" operations in recent months to help cushion the economic slowdown. It has also cut its main policy rates three times this year to support GDP, on top of four cuts in 2019.
The benchmark 7-day reverse repurchase rate  is now 4.25%, but Warjiyo at BI's last policy review had flagged the potential for more cuts.
The government expects Indonesia's GDP to be within a range of a 0.1% contraction to 1% expansion this year, compared with 5% growth in 2019, due to fallout from the pandemic.

551,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Patchy demand at stores spells more pain for garment suppliers,"By Sonya Dowsett and Ruma Paul
MADRID/DHAKA (Reuters) - Fashion brands and retailers re-opening around the world to patchy demand, and carrying unsold stock from spring have cut fall orders by as much as two-thirds in moves spelling more pain for Asian suppliers.
With shoppers still wary of catching the coronavirus at stores, retailers are leaving buying decisions to the last minute and planning on selling all-season basics such as men's chinos and t-shirts leftover from spring through into fall.
""We don't think orders for clothing will pick up anytime soon. Shipments could look up ahead of the Christmas but there is no guarantee,"" said Siddiqur Rahman, a Bangladeshi garment supplier to H&M (ST:HMb) and GAP Inc (N:GPS) among others.
The destructive weight of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to contract the $2.5 trillion global fashion industry by up to 30% in 2020, according to investment bank Bryan, Garnier & Co.
 Nike  (N:NKE) said it has already cancelled around 30% of its pre-pandemic factory orders for the autumn and end-of-year holiday season, while Sweden's H&M said it would sell some ""less seasonal"" spring stock through into autumn. 
Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein owner PVH (N:PVH) said last month it was being very cautious on buying for fall as it reported a drop in same-store sales of around a quarter for re-opened stores in North America.
Ralph Lauren (N:RL) said it had cancelled around two-thirds of autumn season orders, while  Levi Strauss & Co  (N:LEVI) has said it would carry some unsold basic garments forward.
Stores have opened in most of the United States and Europe, and while lines formed outside some, many consumers are staying at home, with almost 60% in the United States surveyed by Coresight Research on June 24 saying they were avoiding malls. 
A  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) survey found that 57% of British consumers planned to stay away from clothing stores for fear of catching the coronavirus. The surge in online sales during the lockdown is not enough to compensate for the slump in traffic.
Cancelled orders result in less work for factories across Asia where hundreds of thousands of garment workers have been laid off since the pandemic struck. 
New orders are down by as much as 45% on the year, said Rubana Huq, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, and factories in the world's second-largest garment maker are operating at around half their capacity in the country.
With consumers wary of returning to stores, retailers are holding out to the last moment to put in orders with suppliers as they try to gauge demand at a time when traditional back-to-school spending plans are up in the air. 
""We need to wait as long as we can with purchases - to take the decisions as near the sales moment as possible,"" H&M Chief Executive Helena Helmersson told Reuters, after the retailer reported its first quarterly loss in decades last month. 
Recruiters for garment companies in Vietnam, a major manufacturer for big sportswear labels such as Nike and Adidas (DE:ADSGn), are feeling the pain.
One recruitment consultant, Will Tran, told Reuters that he and his colleague had just two or two orders in April and May between them, compared with the usual up to ten each.

""So 80 to 90% of job demand went poof,"" he said.

552,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 06:46AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday, July 6th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- China's retail investors pile into stocks at Beijing's urging. Dominion and Duke abandon the Atlantic Coast gas pipeline citing regulatory risks. U.S. stocks are set to reopen higher after the holiday weekend, shrugging off further signs of a virus surge across the south and west. Oil prices are steady as Saudi Arabia signals confidence in the outlook for August. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, July 6th.
1. China's retail investors pile in
China’s benchmark stock index rose by the most in over a year on a wave of retail investor buying encouraged by state-owned media.
The Shanghai and Shenzhen Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 rose 5.7% to close at its highest level since May 2015, after the Chinese Securities Journal spoke of the need to foster a “healthy bull market” in domestic stocks.
The comments come against the background of threats to Chinese companies’ listings in the U.S. from the bubbling trade and geopolitical conflict between the two countries, something that seems likely to increase Chinese companies’ dependence on the domestic capital market in the medium term.
It’s less than five years since the last dramatic bubble in Chinese equities, a bubble that was likewise inflated by a combination of retail investor enthusiasm and strong state messaging.  
2. Dominion, Duke throw in the towel on Atlantic Coast pipeline; Buffett swoops
Dominion Energy Inc (NYSE:D) and  Duke Energy  (NYSE:DUK) said they will abandon their plan to build the $8 billion Atlantic Coast pipeline underneath the Appalachian Trail, citing “the increasing legal uncertainty that overhangs large-scale energy and industrial infrastructure development in the United States.”
Dominion will also sell its remaining gas transportation and storage business to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) in a deal that values the assets at $9.7 billion including debt. The deal marks the end of a drought for Buffett, who has repeatedly complained about the lack of attractive valuations for U.S. companies in recent months.
Berkshire will also take a 25% in Dominion’s Cove Point LNG terminal, although Dominion will remain the largest shareholder.  
3. Stocks set to open higher; Uber (NYSE:UBER) in focus on Postmates deal report
U.S. stock markets are set to reopen after the long weekend in buoyant mood, as the narrative of economic reopening continues to dominate the ongoing increase in coronavirus infection rates across the south and west of the country.
By 6:30 AM ET, the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract was up 365 points or 1.4%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 1.2% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 1.2%.
Among the stocks likely to be in focus Monday are Uber (NYSE:UBER), which was reported at the weekend to be close to buying meal delivery service Postmates in an all-stock transaction worth $2.65 billion. The deal is ostensibly to strengthen the position of UberEats, which CEO Dara Khosroshahi had made a central part of his strategy for the ride-hailing group.
4. Virus cases continue to surge, both in U.S. and globally
Florida and Texas both registered their highest daily numbers to date for new cases of the Covid-19 virus, but state politicians indicated they won’t close down the local economy again.
Texas reported 8,076 new COVID-19 cases Saturday, the first time it has crossed the 8,000 threshold, while Florida reported 11,458 new cases for the same day, also a record.
Florida reported Saturday that 14.1% of those tested for the virus were positive while for Texas the number was 13.1%. The World Health Organization, which registered a new global daily high for new infections at the weekend due to ongoing surges in south Asia and Latin America as well as the U.S., says that governments shouldn’t reopen business if that rate is above 5%.
5. Oil steady as Saudi hikes official selling prices
Crude oil prices were steady above the $40 mark as price signalling from Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest exporter, reinforced confidence that the physical market is approaching balance (despite high levels of crude in storage across the world).
Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia had raised its official selling prices for all types of its crude in August by $1, relative to the Oman/Dubai average.
U.S. crude futures edged down 0.2% to $40.58 a barrel amid concern at the relative strength of U.S. demand in the light of developments in Texas and Florida, while the international benchmark Brent was up 0.9% at $43.20 a barrel."

Poland's central bank has cut rates three times since the outbreak of the coronavirus in the country in March, slashing the cost of borrowing by a total of 140 basis points.
Lon is considered to be the most dovish member on the central bank's 10-member Monetary Policy Council.
""I am convinced that stabilizing the level of interest rates at the current very low level would be a good strategy in Polish monetary policy,"" Lon wrote in the article for the website of Catholic radio station Radio Maryja.
""This would strengthen the belief among participants in the economy that our central bank is trying to do everything possible so as not to harm the wave of economic recovery that we are currently seeing.""
Lon said that he believed raising rates in the second half of 2020 or in 2021 would be ""too risky"".
Poland's finance ministry expects the economy to shrink by around 4% in 2020 due to the impact of the coronavirus.

554,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 06:31AM ET</span>",Who you gonna call? Germbusters! Pandemic drives boom in spray machines,"By Timothy Aeppel
STAMFORD, Connecticut (Reuters) - Timothy Kane, CEO of Goodway Technologies Corp, has never been so popular. Making machines that spray disinfectant, once a niche business, is now an essential service - and the phone is ringing off the hook.
""Our orders jumped 50-fold in April, it was like a switch got flipped,"" said Kane. 
Goodway, which has a factory in Stamford, Connecticut, builds machines that spray an alcohol-infused mist to sanitize surfaces. Until a few months ago, those devices were just a tiny part of its business, catering mostly to places like industrial bakeries that had to constantly clean surfaces. 
Now, as the COVID-19 pandemic grips the United States, everyone wants one.
Kane, who employs 110 workers in the family-owned company, has fielded calls from hotels, gyms and casinos, as well as factories and warehouses. Many would previously never have thought they needed such machines, which often look much like souped-up vacuum cleaners. 
The rise of this industry is one example of a sector that is booming during a pandemic that has laid waste to so many parts of the economy. 
America's battle against the novel coronavirus is driving demand for everything from hand sanitizer and masks to thermometer guns and plexiglass. But one enduring image of this crisis may be the foggers and spraying machines that are now being set loose in airports, sports arenas and subways.
Yvon Brunache bought a Goodway sprayer to help his Florida construction business because clients fearing COVID-19 were reluctant to have his team in their buildings. ""My customers are asking more and more for the space to be sanitized,"" he said.
The surge of business is, however, putting strain on producers that never envisaged such a situation and their supply chains.
Victory Innovations, another maker of hi-tech spray machines, is sold out through September. Its shipments have surged 10-fold since the start of the pandemic, to about 100,000 units a month, according to the company, based in Eden Prairie, Minnesota.
ROBOT FLEET
Servpro Industries LLC has completed 10,000 coronavirus-related deep cleaning operations in the last 90 days, according to Chief Operating Officer John Sooker. 
""We've always done biohazard cleaning, but never at this scale."" 
Servpro, based in Gallatin, Tennessee, is majority owned by the Blackstone Group (N:BX) and runs franchised cleaning businesses across the United States and Canada.
The company, which had sales of about $3 billion last year, figures biohazard cleaning - such as sanitizing a cruise ship after an outbreak of illness - constituted only about 5% of its business then, or $150 million. 
Sooker said he expects COVID-19-related cleaning alone to bring in at least $250 million to $300 million this year.
The crisis is sparking innovation. 
Albuquerque's airport has just introduced a fleet of four robots, each about the size of a small trash can on wheels, which trundle around the terminals every night spraying a disinfectant mist. 
""It costs a fraction of what it would cost to have a team of people doing it,"" said Kimberly Corbitt, chief commercial officer of Build With Robots, one of the machines' developers, although she declined to reveal the cost. 
The airport emphasized that none of its janitors would get laid off as a result, since the fogging is an added layer of overnight cleaning.
FLAMETHROWER
Sophisticated spraying machines don't come cheap, though, even the less automated ones; a small human-operated sprayer mounted in a backpack can set you back about $5,000. 
Biomist Inc., a manufacturer in Wheeling, Ill., has installed spraying systems custom-designed for a facility that cost over $50,000, said Robert Cook, a vice president.
Goodway, meanwhile, has doubled the number of models it is selling to six, creating designs tailored to specific uses such as restaurants and health clubs. 
Workers at its factory can be seen hunched over a row of curved stainless-steel machines mounted on wheels being built on the production floor. 
CEO Kane said there were many ways to spray disinfectants, and that the process could be surprisingly complex, and even potentially dangerous. 
Some machines use water-based cleansers, which take time to dry or must be followed by people wiping the surfaces. Other devices, like those made by Goodway, mix alcohol - which dries almost instantly - with the same chemicals used in fire extinguishers, Kane said.

""If you don't do it right, you can end up with a flamethrower.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is expected to roughly maintain its view the economy will gradually recover later this year from the virus-led downturn, sources familiar with its thinking told Reuters, even as fears of a second wave of infections cloud the outlook.
The central bank's views, from its quarterly report due next week, will heighten the chances it will keep monetary policy steady at a review on July 14-15, after having ramped up stimulus in March and April.
But the BOJ's report is expected to warn that risks to the outlook are extremely high, including a second wave of infections that could delay any recovery in global and Japanese growth, four sources said.
""Japan's economy probably hit bottom,"" said one of the sources. ""The BOJ probably won't need to alter its baseline view that the economy will start to improve later this year,"" the source said, a view echoed by the three other sources.
Japan slipped into recession in the first quarter and is expected to suffer an annualised contraction of more than 20% in April-June, as output and consumption tanked after the government urged businesses to close and citizens to stay home.
Businesses have gradually re-opened and shoppers have returned to the streets since a state of emergency was lifted in late May.
The government's huge stimulus package and central bank lending schemes have also helped cushion the economic blow, paving the way for a modest recovery, the sources said.
As a result of such positive signs, the BOJ is likely to stick to its forecast, made three months ago, that Japan's economy will improve later this year, they said.

In its April report, the BOJ said the economy would remain in a ""severe"" state for some time but improve in the latter half of 2020 on condition that the pandemic's impact will gradually dissipate.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's government unveiled an amended debt restructuring proposal on Sunday and set a deadline of Aug. 4 for creditors to accept it, adding some key sweeteners as it looks to defuse recent tensions with bondholders and strike a deal.
The new proposal https://www.argentina.gob.ar/sites/default/files/anexo-05-07-2020.pdf, which comes after talks to revamp around $65 billion in foreign debt stalled last month, would reduce principal haircuts, increase coupons and include a bond to account for accrued interest, the government said in a statement https://www.argentina.gob.ar/sites/default/files/press_release_roa_en_ingles_con_anexo.pdf that described the amendments as the ""final effort"".
It said the move to sweeten the deal showed the country's ""good faith and willingness to remain engaged with the international financial community"", which it added was key to helping Argentina dig out of a deep economic recession.
Argentina's center-left President Alberto Fernandez said in the statement the offer was the ""maximum effort we can make"".
""It is an enormous effort that we have made to fulfill our word,"" he added.
Argentina is racing to revamp the foreign bonds after tumbling into its ninth sovereign default in May. A deal is key to avoiding a messy and protracted legal standoff that would lock the country out of international credit markets.
The debt talks had progressed well, helping lift local bond prices, until hitting turbulence in mid-June. Two key bondholder groups have since criticized a lack of engagement with the government and pushed for stronger legal protection in any deal.
Argentina's government addressed this concern, saying holders of eligible bonds issued under a 2005 indenture would now be able to exchange for new bonds issued under the same indenture, which give creditors greater protection.
It also said the new proposal would include minimum participation thresholds, which had been sought by another of the three major creditor committees involved in the talks.
""We hope that our creditors understand the restrictions we have, and appreciate our willingness to reach an agreement that works for all parties,"" Economy Minister Martin Guzman said.
Argentina will formally present the proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, the government said in a separate statement.
Argentina's debt restructuring process has been buffeted by the novel coronavirus pandemic, which is pushing the country deeper into recession and driving up poverty. The South American country's economy is expected to contract around 12% this year.
The grains producing stronghold is also looking to strike a new deal with major backer the International Monetary Fund, to help replace a $57 billion credit facility agreed in 2018.

The government also said on Sunday it will send a bill to Congress in the next few days to restructure its local-law foreign currency debt under ""equitable conditions"" to the foreign debt revamp.

557,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2020 07:25PM ET</span>",Banks urge Britain and EU to sort out financial market access,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union need to make progress on EU financial market access given that the coronavirus crisis will make it even harder to cope with potential disruption if there is no agreement, banking lobby AFME said on Monday.
Britain left the EU in January but has full access to the bloc under a transition period that runs until the end of December. 
London and Brussels blamed each other last week for missing a June 30 deadline for assessments on financial market access from January.
Future direct EU access will depend on whether Brussels deems UK regulation to be ""equivalent"" to standards in the bloc.
Although it is far more limited than current access, without equivalence EU investors would not be able to use financial services in London.
""COVID-19 has the potential to disrupt Brexit planning including impacting client readiness, as well as potentially affecting the ability of firms to relocate staff to other jurisdictions,"" AFME said in a statement.
AFME said ensuring that EU investors can continue using clearing houses in London needed addressing before the end of September to avoid customers having to move derivatives positions elsewhere.
Two-way access in stock and derivatives trading was also needed to avoid disruption, AFME said.
AFME called for a formal framework for UK and EU regulators to iron out differences that could jeopardise access.
""This is particularly important in the context of the fast-evolving legislative agenda in the EU and the UK with a number of significant financial services files being proposed, due to be implemented, or under review in the second half of this year and the first half of 2021,"" AFME said.
The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said last week that financial firms must get ready for big changes in January.

""We will only grant equivalences in those areas where it is clearly in the interest of the EU, of our financial stability, our investors and our consumers,"" Barnier said.

558,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2020 07:20PM ET</span>","UK Treasury, British Business Bank reviewing access to state-backed loan schemes - Telegraph","(Reuters) - Britain's Treasury and British Business Bank officials are reviewing access to state-backed loan schemes after the European Union relaxed state aid rules, The Daily Telegraph reported.
The Treasury is considering ways of making it easier for businesses to access coronavirus support loans - ahead of expected measures from British finance minister Rishi Sunak, the newspaper said.
EU regulators loosened state aid rules last week, making it easier for companies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic to receive support for environmental protection and energy projects as well as for research and development.
A Treasury spokesman confirmed to the newspaper that officials ""are considering the implications of this (European Commission) amendment for the loan schemes"" and that the change by the EC was ""an important step in ensuring all viable businesses receive the help they need.""
The report https:// citing Treasury sources, said it was likely that UK firms rejected for emergency help under the EU's financial difficulty tests could reapply if the loan schemes were altered.
Britain was forced to adopt ""financial difficulty"" tests under EU state aid rules, which blocked access to the loans by otherwise solid businesses, such as start-ups, that were loss-making because they have invested heavily for growth, or have complex structures, the report added.

559,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2020 07:20PM ET</span>","Beware of debt costs and an inflationary bite, former UK advisers say","LONDON (Reuters) - The British government should be wary of assuming its mammoth debt pile will always be so cheap to service or that inflation is dead and so must ensure fiscal security by pushing ahead with a digital tax, six former government advisers said on Monday.
The United Kingdom is facing its steepest economic decline in three centuries of modern British history and is borrowing vast amounts from the bond markets to inject money into the hemorrhaging economy.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government should beware of rising debt costs and the surprise of an inflationary bubble, former advisers to prime ministers Theresa May and David Cameron said in a report for the Onward think tank.
""The volatile history of interest rates should make us wary of thinking low real interest rates are here forever,"" said the advisers including Mats Persson, former adviser to Cameron, and Raoul Ruparel, a former adviser to May.
""The possibility of surprise inflation still exists,"" they said. ""In the 1970s, inflation peaked at over 25% in the UK, a level few had predicted only a few years earlier.""
The advisers, including May advisers Neil O’Brien and Will Tanner, said reform of the UK's tax system was essential, including a digital tax.
""This should be prioritised regardless of concerns from partners such as the U.S. over a digital services tax,"" they said.
The U.S. has threatened trade retaliation against European countries that create their own digital taxes as a way to raise revenue from the local operations of big tech companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc’s Google and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).

560,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2020 06:20PM ET</span>",Britain's finance ministry pledges funding to triple number of UK traineeships,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will offer its largest ever expansion of traineeships, its finance ministry said on Sunday, ahead of a highly-anticipated update due later in the week on the government's support for the economy through the coronavirus crisis.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak has rushed out emergency measures worth an estimated 133 billion pounds ($163.7 billion) since the start of the crisis, mostly to keep people in jobs after many businesses were forced to close due to the COVID-19 lockdown.
The economy shrank 25% in March and April as entire sectors were shuttered.
With the economy beginning to re-open, Sunak will give an economic update on Wednesday where he is expected to outline further measures of support for workers and businesses.
On Tuesday Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to shake Britain's economy out of its coronavirus-induced crisis by fast-tracking infrastructure investment and slashing property planning rules.
But with most of Johnson's headline spending previously announced, attention has turned to Sunak for more details on fresh plans to support the recovery.
He will announce a 111 million pound investment to triple the number of traineeships, the finance ministry said, adding that businesses would get a 1,000-pound bonus for everyone they offer a work experience placement.
As finance minister since February, Sunak has been widely credited for acting decisively with a job-retention scheme which has seen the government pay 80% of the wages of furloughed workers, and an emergency loan programme for businesses.
Johnson has cautioned that the furlough cannot go on forever. The scheme is due to end in October and employers will have to make contributions from August.
Sunak is also mulling plans to hand out 500 pounds in vouchers to adults, and 250 pounds to children, to spend in sectors of the economy hit hardest by the coronavirus crisis, the Guardian said on Sunday.

561,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 05, 2020 05:45PM ET</span>",Markets Torn Between Robust Economic Data and Rising Virus Cases,"(Bloomberg) -- Global markets are caught in a tug-of-war between optimism over better-than-expected economic data, and concern over the surge in coronavirus infections.
While currencies saw muted moves in early trading on Monday, the Australian dollar underperformed, dropping as much as 0.2%. The nation has seen a rise in infections recently. The big worry, however, is the U.S., where a surge in cases pushed global figures above 11.3 million.
Even though U.S. labor data showed a marked improvement in June, the dollar fell last week, ending the currency’s longest-winning streak since January. The Citi Economic Surprise Index for the nation soared to a record, while a similar gauge for major economies is at the highest level since 2017.
It’s a push and pull between positive and negative numbers that has lasted for weeks, said Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp, adding that markets may be headed for a “Let’s Make a Deal” moment, referencing a popular game show in the U.S. that started in the 1960s.
“Behind door number one sits the all-in trade from a vaccine discovery,” said Innes. “Behind door number two lies the relatively optimistic economic outcome, but it’s door number three, where the prophet of doom sits reminding us the virus risk will lead to a more significant growth hit in the third quarter.”
Economic releases from developed nations through Friday may help investors decide. Germany’s industrial production probably bounced back in May, as did Italian retail sales, based on estimates compiled by Bloomberg. PMI data from the U.S. may show a minor improvement.

The measures include access to zero-interest loans, subsidized rent and the ability to defer mortgage loan payments for up to six months, Pinera said in a televised speech.
""The coronavirus pandemic...is hitting our middle class hard,"" Pinera said, touting the fresh round of stimulus as a bailout at least 1 million families. 
Pinera's center-right administration has already announced two sprawling stimulus packages worth nearly 12% of gross domestic product, aimed primarily at protecting small business, the poor and the unemployed. 
The coronavirus pandemic, which struck just as Chile was beginning to recover from months of unrest over inequality, has hammered the country's economy. Chile's middle class - long the envy of the region- has been especially hard hit.
Unemployment crested 11% between March and May and is expected to continue to rise as lockdown measures in the capital Santiago take their toll. The central bank has predicted GDP will plunge by as much as 7.5% in 2020, the worst in 35 years.
The new plan will help subsidize university payments for middle-class families and partially underwrite the home or apartment rental fees for those who pay less than 400,000 pesos, or $500 per month.
Chile has reported more than 295,000 cases of coronavirus, surpassing the tally in crisis-racked Italy, and 6,308 deaths from the disease.

The central bank estimated last month that the euro zone's second-biggest economy would be operating 12% below normal levels by the end of June, up from a 32% reduction at the start of France's coronavirus lockdown in late March.
The Bank of France is due to update its estimate on Tuesday, drawing on responses from a monthly business climate survey of thousands of companies.
""The recovery is going at least as well as we expected and perhaps a little better,"" Villeroy said on LCI television.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada should focus on boosting economic growth after getting pummeled by the COVID-19 crisis, analysts say, even as concerns about the sustainability of its debt are growing, with Fitch downgrading the nation's rating just over a week ago.
Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau will deliver a ""fiscal snapshot"" on Wednesday that will outline the current balance sheet and may give an idea of the money the government is setting aside for the future.
As the economy recovers, some fiscal support measures, which are expected to boost the budget deficit sharply, could be wound down and replaced by incentives meant to get people back to work and measures to boost economic growth, economists said.
""The only solution to these large deficits is growth, so we need a transition to a pro-growth agenda,"" said Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada. 
The IMF expects Canada's economy to contract by 8.4% this year. Ottawa is already rolling out more than C$150 billion in direct economic aid, including payments to workers impacted by COVID-19. 
Further stimulus measures could include a green growth strategy, as well as spending on infrastructure, including smart infrastructure, economists said. Smart infrastructure makes use of digital technology. 
""We have to make sure that government spending is calibrated to the economy of the future rather than the economy of the past,"" Wright said.
Canada lost one of its coveted triple-A ratings in June when Fitch downgraded it for the first time, citing the billions of dollars in emergency aid Ottawa has spent to help bridge the downturn caused by COVID-19 shutdowns.
Standard & Poor's, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and DBRS still give Canadian debt the highest rating. At DBRS, Michael Heydt, the lead sovereign analyst on Canada, says his concern is about potential structural damage to the economy if the slowdown lingers too long.
Fiscal policymakers ""need to be confident that there is a recovery under way before they start talking about (debt) consolidation,"" Heydt said.
Fitch expects Canada's total government debt will rise to 115.1% of GDP in 2020 from 88.3% in 2019. 
Royce Mendes, a senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the economy still needs more support. 

""Turning too quickly toward austerity would be a clear mistake,"" he said.

What You Need to Know,"(Bloomberg) -- Editor’s Note: No city is more important to America’s economy than New York, and none has been hit harder by the coronavirus. “NYC Reopens” examines life in the capital of capitalism as the city takes its first halting steps toward a new normal.
As other parts of the U.S. hastily roll back reopening plans, New York City is taking one more small step forward.
On Monday, the city officially kicks off ‘Phase Three,’ paving the way for legions of beauty businesses — nail salons, tanning studios and tattoo parlors — to open their doors to customers for the first time in months.
Yet perhaps the biggest and most widely anticipated change — the resumption of indoor dining — has been postponed indefinitely. Blame the recent Covid-19 spikes in states such as Texas and Florida after they reopened bars and restaurants.
Both New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio have repeatedly urged New Yorkers to remain vigilant and not let their guard down. Coronavirus cases in the U.S. topped 50,000 in a single day for the first time this past week, even as infections in New York reach new lows.
“It’s been a long battle, and it continues to be,” de Blasio said.
Here’s what you need to know:
What does ‘Phase Three’ reopening mean?
It’s the third of a four-step process that will ease restrictions gradually on business activity and people’s ability to move around and socialize in the state of New York. Progress depends on infection rates, hospital capacity and the state’s ability to test and trace people who may have contracted the virus. Regardless, each phase will last at least two weeks.
New York City entered ‘Phase Two’ on June 22 — the last region to do so. Several other regions are already in the fourth phase.
We’re tracking everything you need to know as New York reopens after the Covid-19 shutdown. Read our explainer and sign up for alerts sent directly to your inbox.
What’s still closed?
The mayor and governor said indoor dining in the city won’t resume for the time being, citing the resurgence of cases in parts of the country that have taken a more cavalier approach. Gyms, schools, movie theaters and other large venues for culture and entertainment still are shut, and some won’t reopen even after the city enters the fourth phase. The Broadway League, a trade association for the theater industry in New York and beyond, said the city’s theaters will remain closed through the end of the year.
It’s getting hot out! Are the beaches open yet?
Yes, the city’s public beaches opened for swimming on July 1. And as of Friday, the S train, a subway shuttle that runs on the Rockaway Peninsula, began picking up riders at Rockaway Boulevard in Queens between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. That special service lasts through Labor Day.
Fifteen of the city’s outdoor pools — four in Manhattan, two in Staten Island and three in each of the other boroughs — will open in coming weeks.
Can my dog finally get some exercise?
Yes and so can you. The city will reopen dog runs — meaning your four-legged friends can finally work off some of their pent-up energy. The city will also open courts for basketball, tennis and other sports. However, you should still try to practice social distancing, and the city encourages residents to wear masks while using these facilities. So expect to play on your own for a while.
Some states seem to going in reverse. Could that happen in New York, too?
The state’s reopening is conditioned on seven different measurements ranging from infection rates to hospital capacity and testing and tracing. As long as those remain below certain thresholds, the process can continue. City and state officials haven’t publicly said whether they would roll back parts of the reopening if a resurgence of cases pushes a region above those limits.
With indoor dining postponed, is outdoor dining at risk?
For now, there’s no reason to worry. “Outdoor dining, unquestionably, has been a great hit,” de Blasio said July 1, adding that it “is working, period.” Around 6,600 venues so far have taken advantage of the city’s initiative to expand outdoor-seating options, and the city is working to involve more restaurants in that effort, he said. The city also plans to close more streets to traffic on evenings and weekends to give restaurants more space for dining al fresco.

And just to be sure — social-distancing requirements are still in place, right?
You already know the answer to this question. Wear a face covering, keep people at a 6-foot distance and wash your hands. At outdoor restaurants, you’re allowed to take off your mask once seated.

567,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 05, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>",Economic Calendar - Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,"By Noreen Burke
Investing.com -- The increasing number of Covid-19 cases in some U.S. states which has led to reopening plans being paused or rolled back is going to be an ongoing source of worry for investors as the second half of 2020 gets underway. It’s a quiet week on the U.S. economic calendar, with Thursday’s report on jobless claims set to be the highlight. Across the pond, Brexit talks rumble on and euro zone finance ministers are to meet for further discussions on the bloc’s recovery fund ahead of a crucial summit later this month. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
Florida and Texas, two states that have emerged as the latest hot spots of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, both reported new single-day record increases in confirmed Covid-19 cases on Saturday - with nearly 20,000 additional infections combined.
The recent surge, most pronounced in Southern and Western states that were among the last to impose restrictions at the outset of the pandemic and the first to relax them, has alarmed public health officials.
The pandemic’s trajectory remains the main source of uncertainty for investors and more than 40% of the U.S. has now reversed or placed reopenings on hold, analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a recent note, with renewed containment measures set to add to the problems in the labor market.
On Monday, the Institute of Supply management reports its survey of U.S. non-manufacturing activity, with economists forecasting a move back into positive territory. Meanwhile, data firm IHS Markit will publish data on U.S. business activity.
Thursday’s weekly report on initial jobless claims will be closely watched as the level of new layoffs continues to remain elevated even as businesses reopen, a sign the recovery in the labor market will be slow, economists say.
Also Thursday Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) reports quarterly results and data on U.S. producer prices is due out on Friday.
After finishing the first half of 2020 on a high, market bulls are going into the second half buoyed up by signs of an economic rebound and hopes for a vaccine. Economic data out of Europe and China is also indicating that a recovery is underway, and the upcoming earnings season may offer proof of earnings bottoming out.
But several obstacles still loom. It is still unclear whether the U.S. Congress will extend a scheme supplementing jobless benefits beyond July 31. The run-up to the U.S. presidential election in November will be choppy, especially if Democrat Joe Biden extends his poll lead. And the EU needs to agree on a $750 billion recovery fund proposal.
Investors also worry about authorities getting cold feet as debt levels mount. There are no indications of that so far, but any sign of policymakers easing up on stimulus measures could spell trouble.
Germany has just taken over the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union as the bloc faces its deepest recession since WW2.
EU leaders must agree on a multi-year budget of over 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion), launch a recovery fund for economies hit hardest by COVID-19 and clarify its future relationship with post-Brexit Britain.
A meeting of euro area finance ministers on Thursday could be telling before a looming July 17-18 summit - crucial to securing agreement on a recovery fund.
Germany wants to use its time in the EU presidency to make Europe strong again; a recovery fund agreement would certainly help. Markets are hopeful that solidarity will prevail - the euro is up over 5% since March but optimism could fade if bickering sets in.
Last week’s round of Brexit talks broke up a day early amid “serious” disagreements between the two sides, with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, complaining of a lack of respect and engagement by the British government.
The two sides are due to resume talks this week in London but seem unlikely to yield any more success.
Britain left the world’s largest trading bloc on Jan. 31, but there has been little progress on designing a new relationship with a year-end deadline looming. Both sides had hoped last week's negotiations would reboot the process.

(Reuters) - With promises of extra financing for small businesses and more jobs as a severe economic downturn looms, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Sunday launched her party's campaign ahead of September general election. 
Ardern's rise to become New Zealand's most popular prime minister in a century, buoyed by her response to the COVID-19 pandemic that has left the country largely unscathed, has boosted her prospects in the Sept. 19 election.
Ardern's Labour Party, governing in a coalition with the Greens and the nationalist New Zealand First party, will face the National Party in what is expected to be a pandemic-dominated campaign.
If the prime minister's high ratings are mirrored in the election results, Labour would govern on its own, without needing a coalition. 
The government's early and hard coronavirus curbs that paralysed economic activity have put the country in a technical recession for the first time in a decade.
""There wasn't a playbook for COVID,"" Ardern said at the Labour Party congress. ""There wasn't a playbook for the recovery.""
She said a loan scheme for small businesses, which allows for no interest loans if paid back within a year and which was to end this month, will be extended until the year-end, and more environmental and infrastructure jobs will be created under a previously announced plan. 
Small and medium-sized enterprises generate about a third of New Zealand's gross domestic product. 
""I can't think of a time in our recent history when we have been collectively challenged by such a cruel combination of events – a terrorist attack, a volcanic eruption, a global pandemic and now its ensuing financial crisis,"" Ardern said. 
Her leadership, widely seen as compassionate and steely, after last year's killing of 51 Muslim worshippers in the country's worst mass shooting, and after the December eruption of a volcano that killed 21, has brought Ardern worldwide admiration.

The number of work coaches at British job centres will double to 27,000 at a cost of 800 million pounds ($997 million), the ministry said.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak is due to announce on Wednesday his next steps for steering the world's fifth-biggest economy away from its lockdown slump which caused a 20% contraction in output in April. 
The number of people on British employers' payrolls fell by more than 600,000 in April and May and vacancies plunged by the most on record in the three months to May.
The work coaches will give jobseekers personalised support to build skills and improve their employment prospects, the ministry said.
Last week, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, Gita Gopinath, said Britain should consider increasing its unemployment benefits to help get people into the kind of work that is likely to be in demand after the lockdown.

Employers have called on the government to cut their social security contributions and take other measures to help them keep workers on their books after Britain's huge state furlough scheme expires at the end of October.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday signed into law a deadline extension to August 8 for small businesses to apply for relief loans under a federal aid program to help businesses hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House said.
The extension to the Payroll Protection Program (PPP), which was launched in April to keep Americans on company payrolls and off unemployment assistance, gives business owners an additional five weeks to apply for funding assistance plagued by problems.
An estimated $130 billion of the $659 billion provided by Congress is still up for grabs. Critics worry the U.S. Small Business Administrator's office, which administers the loan, may continue to experience challenges in fairly distributing the funds.
From the outset, the unprecedented first-come-first-served program struggled with technology and paperwork problems that led some businesses to miss out while some affluent firms got funds. 
The SBA's inspector general found in May that some rural, minority and women-owned businesses may not have received loans due to a lack of prioritization from the agency.

Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-ppp-exclusive/exclusive-us-small-business-program-handed-out-virus-aid-to-many-borrowers-twice-idUSKBN2391S9 on Thursday that a technical snafu in a U.S. government system caused many small businesses to receive loans twice or more times, nearly a dozen people with knowledge of the matter said.

576,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2020 04:15AM ET</span>","China names and shames misbehaving shareholders of banks, insurers","SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese regulators adopted shock and awe tactics on Saturday to target misbehaving shareholders of banks and insurers by naming and shaming 38 corporate investors for having ""gravely"" violated rules and laws in their first such exercise.
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) said the disclosure aimed to limit financial risks and improve corporate governance, adding that such lists of names would be regularly published in future.
China has stepped up scrutiny of shareholders in financial institutions after the failure of once-acquisitive conglomerate Anbang Insurance Group, which the government seized in early 2018. Its chairman and key shareholder, Wu Xiaohui, was prosecuted for economic crimes.
Regulators also tightened the screws on shareholders in small lenders last year with the takeover of Baoshang Bank, once controlled by private conglomerate Tomorrow Holdings. Concern has grown that big shareholders could exploit their positions to secure easy loans.
Despite the cleanup efforts of the past few years, some shareholders in banks and insurers still engage in illegitimate ways, the regulator said on Saturday, so publishing the names of offenders serves to inhibit them.
The 38 shareholders named by CBIRC have engaged in activities such as flouting regulatory ownership rules, using unqualified sources of funding, fabricating materials, or profiting from illegal transactions, the regulators said.
The list includes shareholders in Anbang, Kunlun Health Insurance and Ningbo Donghai Bank, according to the CBIRC statement and information compiled by Reuters based on China's business registration database.

577,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2020 01:00AM ET</span>",Column: What would private equity funds in 401(k)s mean for retirement savers?,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Employer retirement plans are not known for their flashy investments - a majority of 401(k) investors these days use target date funds that invest in broad, diversified equity and fixed income mutual funds that automatically rebalance to minimize risk as retirement approaches.
That has been a healthy, if unexciting, trend. But in the years ahead, some plan sponsors may start spicing things up. Last week, the federal government opened the door for plan sponsors to add private equity funds to their 401(k) plans. Private equity funds invest in everything from buyouts of mature non-public companies to firms getting ready to go public - and even venture capital startups. Until now, these investments have been available only to wealthy and institutional investors. 
The private equity industry has been knocking on the 401(k) door for a number of years, and the attraction is not difficult to understand. Defined contribution plans represent a huge pool of investable funds, holding $8.9 trillion in assets at the end of 2019, according to the Investment Company Institute.
Private equity proponents scored a win last week when the U.S. Department of Labor (DoL) issued a guidance letter outlining how private equity could be added to defined contribution plans under existing rules (https://reut.rs/2BTOymi). The letter could mark a turning point in a broader move to open up private equity investing to less affluent, individual investors. 
In the retail investing world, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing its rules governing sales of private equity, including liberalization of the rules restricting these investments to ""accredited investors"" - those with net worth (excluding their primary residence) of $1 million or more, or annual income of at least $200,000 for single filers ($300,000 for joint filers) for the past two years.
Private equity advocates argue that these funds can produce higher returns over time than the stock of publicly held companies, even net of fees. 
""If you think of the stock market as a way for investors to harness the economic power of gross domestic product and capitalizing on that, a growing portion of that activity today is being held by private investors today as opposed to being in the public markets,” said David O’Meara, senior defined contribution strategist at consulting firm Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW).
A SLICE OF THE INVESTMENT PIE 
But the difference in returns among private equity funds can be huge. And unlike active mutual funds, where top performers do not outperform the market consistently over the long term, top private equity funds have greater “persistence,” because top managers get first look at the highest-quality investments, according to Fran Kinniry, global head of private investment at Vanguard. “You need to have confidence that you can pick managers who are in the top third of performance,” he said. 
If private equity does start popping up in workplace plans, it likely will have a slice of the investment pie in target date funds that will not exceed 15%, experts say.
Among the three largest providers of target date funds - Vanguard, Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price - none are jumping on the bandwagon yet, although none have ruled it out for the future. 
Vanguard, which has long advised foundations and endowments on private equity investments, is now expanding its offerings to high net-worth clients, and next year will begin offering it to clients in its fast-growing Personal Advisor Services who meet the current - or revised - accredited investor standards, Kinniry said.
One challenge for plan sponsors will be how to value private equity on a daily basis. In 401(k) plans, participants are able to check the value of their holdings at any time, but valuations of private equity investments are updated only periodically. 
Meanwhile, the DoL letter lays out some fiduciary hurdles that plan sponsors would have to leap, said Fred Reish, an attorney with Faegre Drinker who specializes in employee benefits. ""It says fiduciaries must have the expertise to be able to evaluate these products, or hire advisers or managers who do. And participants must be given information that they can understand and use to decide whether or not to be in that investment.""
Reish thinks those goals can be met by large, sophisticated 401(k) plans. But he does not expect to see private equity turning up in plans overnight, noting employers are a cautious bunch. “They read all the headlines about other plan sponsors being sued for violations of their fiduciary duties, and it scares them to death.”
In recent years, many of those headlines have been generated by attorney Jerome Schlichter, senior partner at Schlichter Bogard & Denton. He has won more than $350 million in 401(k) excessive-fee cases for employees and retirees, and won judgments that required defendants to improve their plans - relief he values at more than $1.5 billion.
""This is fraught with peril both for employees and companies that choose to do this,"" Schlichter said. ""There’s a reason private equity investments have been limited to wealthy, sophisticated investors. This is grafting a product that wasn’t designed to be in the retirement plan of an average investor into those retirement plans.""

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's economy is expected to contract by 12% in 2020, a monthly central bank poll of analysts showed on Friday, worse than the previous estimate of a 9.4% decline, as output is ravaged by measures to tame the coronavirus outbreak.
The central bank poll of 41 analysts projected that inflation will be 40.7% this year. Prices are expected to have risen 2% in June, according to the poll.
The poll did find a silver lining, noting that ""the expectation of growth for the remaining quarters of 2020 suggest that the effect of the coronavirus pandemic is perceived as transitory.""
The grim economic picture comes as Argentina tries to restructure about $65 billion in debt after defaulting on its sovereign bonds earlier this year. The South American nation is readying a final debt restructuring offer to creditors that could be formally sent to U.S. regulators within days, a government source told Reuters on Friday.
Analysts forecast the average nominal exchange rate will reach 88 pesos per dollar in December 2020 and 122.5 pesos per dollar in December 2021.

LONDON/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's government is reading a final debt restructuring offer to creditors which could be formally sent to U.S. regulators within days, a government source told Reuters on Friday, even as increasingly splintered bondholders tabled another proposal of their own.
Argentina will present its new offer to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the coming days, according to a government source. A day earlier, a source close to the negotiations said the government was ""crafting the definitive and final offer"" to creditors.
Meanwhile, a new counteroffer by bondholders, which Reuters reported had been tabled on Thursday, will provide the government with $39 billion of cashflow relief over the next eight years, the Argentina Creditor Committee (ACC) said. It includes a requirement that two-thirds of bonds participate in any deal.
Debt specialists see the participation threshold as important. If the government did not accept it they say it could signal an intention to adopt a so-called 'Pac-Man' strategy' whereby the government tries to get investors to deal with it one at a time.
""The ACC continues to believe that the best way forward is a consensual resolution,"" the group said in a statement.
Sources on Thursday said the new ACC offer valued bonds at around 54.5 cents on the dollar. That would be a modest drop from its previous offer of around 55-56 cents but would still be above the government's last proposal of 50 cents plus sweeteners.
The ACC added that its offer would leave creditors with a weighted average coupon of 3.95% on their bonds with a 5% maximum. Eligible bonds would also maintain their original indentures - the contract associated with the bond - meaning they would not have inferior legal guarantees.
The move comes at a crucial stage in the $65 billion debt renegotiations with the Argentine government.
Talks have been extended a number of times in an effort to reach a deal, though the two biggest creditor groups, the ""Ad Hoc"" and ""Exchange"" groups, which hold a combined $21 billion of the $65 billion, have complained this week of lack of engagement from the government.
Sources familiar with the thinking of those two groups have told Reuters that they still want a better deal than the ACC proposal.
They also say that if Argentina's next offer is not up to scratch they will have a so-called ""lock up"", which would prevent any of the individual firms in the groups peeling off and accepting a deal if the government did try the Pac-Man approach.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is suspending its extradition treaty with Hong Kong in the wake of new Chinese national security legislation and could boost immigration from the former British colony, top officials said on Friday.
China imposed the legislation this week despite protests from Hong Kongers and Western nations, setting what is a major financial hub on a more authoritarian track.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would continue to stand up for Hong Kong, which is home to 300,000 Canadians.
Canada will not permit the export of sensitive military items to Hong Kong, he told reporters.
""We are also suspending the Canada-Hong Kong extradition treaty ... we are also looking at additional measures, including around immigration,"" he said. He did not give details.
Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne condemned the ""secretive"" way the legislation had been enacted and said Canada had been forced to reassess existing arrangements.
""This is a significant step back in terms of freedom and liberty ... we had been hoping Beijing would listen to the international community and reverse course,"" he said by phone.
German and British leaders also expressed concerns about the new law.
""(There's) a deep reflection in many capitals around the world as to how best to deal with China and its assertiveness,"" Champagne said.
China's embassy in Ottawa was not immediately available for comment. The two nations are locked in a dispute which erupted in late 2018 after Canadian police detained Huawei Technologies Co's chief financial officer on a U.S. warrant.
The new law has prompted a jump in inquiries from families looking to relocate to Canada, immigration lawyers said.

Possible measures Ottawa could take include favoring Hong Kong residents who have family in Canada and allowing more people to apply for a work program that is a step towards gaining citizenship, lawyers say.

The announcement from Chief Prosecutor Tarek Saab came a day after a London court recognized Guaido as Venezuela's interim president, as part of a legal dispute over whether Guaido or President Nicolas Maduro should control $1 billion of the country's gold stored in London.
Saab said the orders of apprehension were requested for the crimes of treason, usurpation of functions and association to commit crimes. He added that all those involved lived outside the country, and did not rule out international actions to carry out the arrests.
Apart from Ricardo Villasmil, president of the ad hoc board, the prosecutor also included Guaido's representative in London, Vanessa Neumann, as well as three other collaborators of the opposition leader.
Saab alleged that Guaido and his collaborators seek to ""strip"" Venezuela of its wealth in the legal battle over Venezuela's gold reserves. The opposition, meanwhile, says Maduro wants gold to pay his allies.
Over the past two years, Maduro's government has removed some 30 tonnes of gold from its reserves in Venezuela to sell abroad for much-needed hard currency.
A member of Guaido's legal team said they now expect the court to determine whether Guaido has the authority to represent Venezuela's central bank in another legal case to decide control over the gold itself.
Guaido, the National Assembly speaker who was recognized as Venezuela’s legitimate president by dozens of Western countries after invoking the constitution to assume the role in January 2019, has not succeeded in ousting Maduro, accused of rigging his 2018 re-election.
Maduro, who has overseen an economic collapse in the once-prosperous OPEC nation and is accused of corruption and human rights violations, calls Guaido a U.S. puppet.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukrainian Central Bank Governor Yakiv Smoliy said on Friday he had quit to register a protest against sustained pressure from the government and politicians to take policy decisions that were not based on economics.
Speaking minutes before parliament voted to approve his resignation, Smoliy said the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) had been pressured to cut interest rates, let inflation rise and the hryvnia lose value.
He also complained of smear campaigns against him and other central bank employees, paid rallies outside the bank and pressure being exerted on courts where the central bank was involved in legal cases.
It was the first time Smoliy has spoken at length in public since his shock resignation on Wednesday evening, which rattled the market and raised concerns among Ukraine's Western backers about the government's commitment to reforms.
""My resignation - this is a protest, a signal, a red line,"" Smoliy told lawmakers. 
""I made a difficult but necessary decision - to resign, because for a long time the National Bank has been under systematic political pressure, pressure to make decisions that are not economically justified ... and can cost the Ukrainian economy dear,"" he added.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's office has denied that Smoliy has been put under pressure and sought to reassure investors that the central bank would remain independent under Smoliy's successor, who has yet to be named.
Zelenskiy's party is discussing several potential candidates and will aim to confirm the appointment in parliament between July 14 and 17, lawmaker Iryna Vereshchuk said, according to Interfax Ukraine.
The candidates include Danylo Hetmantsev, head of the parliamentary finance committee and a member of Zelenskiy's party.
They also include the head of the central bank's supervisory council, Bohdan Danylyshyn; Kyrylo Shevchenko, the head of the state-run Ukrgasbank, and Volodymyr Lavrenchuk, the former head of Raiffeisen Bank Aval, she added.

Smoliy's deputy Kateryna Rozhkova took temporary charge and told reporters at a briefing that maintaining the central bank's independence would remain a ""red line"", and that it would not be pressured into printing money.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday he was still unsure whether he would go to Washington D.C. next week to celebrate a new North American trade treaty, citing concern about possible U.S. tariffs on aluminum.
Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump next week, has said he would like Trudeau to attend.
""We're still in discussions with the Americans about whether a trilateral summit next week makes sense,"" Trudeau said in a news conference. ""We're obviously concerned about the proposed issue of tariffs on aluminum and steel that the Americans have floated recently.""
U.S. national security tariffs on imported steel and aluminum - including from Canada and Mexico - were a major irritant during negotiations for the United States-Mexico-Canada trade deal, which was reached last year and entered into force on July 1.
But now, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is considering domestic producers' request to restore the 10% duty on Canadian aluminum to combat a ""surge"" of imports.
Concern about the ""health situation and the coronavirus reality that is still hitting all three of our countries"" is another factor in his decision on whether to go to Washington, Trudeau said.
The spread of the novel coronavirus has slowed steadily in Canada over the past eight weeks, but new cases are spiking in many U.S. states.

As of June 2, Canada had recorded a total of 104,772 coronavirus cases, with 68,345 recovered and 8,642 deaths.

Spain would be one of the main beneficiaries of the recovery fund with around 140 billion euros in loans and grants.

(Reuters) - The European Union is overestimating the emissions-cutting potential of climate action schemes outlined in its next budget and should change its methodology for assessing their effectiveness, auditors said.
The executive European Commission has pledged to spend 25% of the bloc's 2021-27 budget -- setting aside roughly 320 billion euros at current prices -- to help the 27-nation EU become ""climate neutral"" by 2050.
But the European Court of Auditors (ECA) said in a report published on Thursday that the Commission had overstated the current 2014-2020 budget's contribution to tackling climate change and warned the same was likely to be true in 2021-27. 
""The anticipated contributions to climate-related spending, in particular from some agricultural schemes, are likely to be overstated,"" ECA member Joelle Elvinger told Reuters. 
""Without a robust methodology, the estimated climate spending may not be reliable.""
Agricultural programmes are expected to make up nearly half of climate spending from the next EU budget. 
ECA said Commission estimates of these schemes' emissions-cutting potential were ""unrealistic"" and did not account for the negative impact of other agricultural schemes that caused extra emissions by increasing livestock breeding and fertiliser use. 
It said the Commission should amend its methodology to account for this impact and balance it with increased climate spending in other areas.
""In the next long-term budget, we have introduced a series of improvements to make sure our programmes better contribute towards the climate objective,"" a Commission spokesperson said. 
The Commission said it had proposed tougher EU environmental standards for upcoming agricultural spending. 

It also plans to ban funding for fossil fuel projects from parts of the new seven-year budget, which member states will attempt to agree on this month.

""Recent data solidifies the confidence in our baseline scenario with a more favourable balance of risks,"" the Dutch central bank president said in a speech at a webinar hosted by Bloomberg.
The ECB last month said it expected the economy of the euro zone to shrink by 8.7% in 2020, followed by growth of 5.2% and 3.3% respectively in the next two years.
Knot said confidence in this outlook had been bolstered by recent data, which had been better than expected.
""Confidence indicators showed a strong rebound in June to close an otherwise disastrous second quarter,"" he said. ""Forward-looking confidence indicators already signalled a bottoming-out in May.""
To stimulate the recovery and to offset the surge in private savings brought on by the looming deep recession, governments should increase their spending, Knot said.
The Dutchman said he welcomed recent proposals for the European Recovery Fund, as they include important investments in digitalisation and Europe's Green Deal.
""In these times of exceptional uncertainty, it would provide an important signal that we do not stop at only stabilising our economies, but also take the opportunity to address common longer-term challenges.""

After finishing the first half of 2020 on a high, bulls have charged into the remaining six months on promising news of a vaccine and data showing 4.8 million U.S. jobs created in June, after 2.7 million in May. 
European and Chinese data also suggest a recovery is under way, and investors hope third quarter economic data will reinforce that. The upcoming results season may offer proof of earnings bottoming out.
Several hurdles loom. The months leading up to the U.S. presidential election in November will be choppy, especially if Democrat Joe Biden extends his poll lead. The EU needs to agree on a $750 billion recovery fund proposal. And will the U.S. Congress extend a scheme supplementing jobless benefits beyond July 31? 
Investors also worry about authorities getting cold feet as debt levels mount. No sign of that yet, but their track record of premature policy tightening post-2008 makes investors nervous. Any sign of policymakers tapping on the stimulus brakes too soon will spell trouble.

A wave of foreign money has hit mainland China's markets as the second half of 2020 kicks in.

Stock indexes are at multi-month highs and margin borrowing by leveraged investors has soared, signs that this wave of buying has legs. 
Sell-side analysts have been expecting this rally for weeks on hopes Beijing will recover faster than other economies given a mix of state-directed infrastructure spending, lending and pent-up domestic demand. The IMF too expects China to be the only major economy to grow this year. 
Shanghai stocks (SSEC) may now easily push into the 20%-plus bull market territory. Buyers beware?

A meeting of euro area finance ministers next week could be telling before a looming July 17-18 summit - crucial to securing agreement on a recovery fund.
Germany wants to use its time in the EU presidency to make Europe strong again; a recovery fund agreement would certainly help. Markets are hopeful that solidarity will prevail - the euro is up over 5% since March but optimism could fade if bickering sets in. Indeed, the next six months in the EU hotseat will not be easy for Berlin.

Ukraine is on the hunt for a new central bank chief as the shock resignation of Yakiv Smoliy casts a pall over what was one of the better performing emerging markets following the coronavirus crisis.
Rising foreign exchange reserves, an IMF programme and a reform-minded president in the form of Volodymyr Zelenskiy had made Ukraine a favourite among emerging market investors.
But Smoliy's exit on Wednesday, in which he complained of ""systematic political pressure,"" led to the scrapping of a $1.75 billion Eurobond sale and threatens to undo the goodwill. 
Who replaces him, the extent of guarantees about central bank independence and the broader reform agenda, will determine whether Ukraine can resume its position as EM darling.

593,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 03, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday, July 3rd","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Emmanuel Macron reshuffles his government after painful losses in regional elections at the weekend. The U.K. prepares to reopen its pubs, hotels and restaurants, but European markets can't shake concerns about the coronavirus across the Atlantic, where the U.S. continues to post over 50,000 new cases a day. India steps up its retaliation against China in the wake of last month's border dispute and oil weakens amid bickering over compliance with the OPEC+ deal on output cuts. With U.S. markets closed for the Independence Day holiday, here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, July 3rd. 
1. Macron ditches government after regional poll loss
France’s Prime Minister Edouard Philippe resigned along with all his government, paving the way for President Emmanuel Macron to set a new policy course with two years of his term remaining.
A government reshuffle had been expected in the wake of heavy defeats across France for Macron’s La Republique en Marche movement in local elections at the weekend. Philippe had put himself in the departure lounge by running for and winning the position of mayor of Le Havre.
All the same, the resignation of the entire government is a surprise. Having gained the presidency by cannibalizing France’s political center, it seems likely that with his new government, he will try to drain support away from the country’s Green party, which was the main winner of Sunday’s elections.
2. Lockdown is over - let's go down the pub 
The U.K. will reopen its pubs, restaurants and hotels at the weekend, in a major test of its ability to keep the coronavirus pandemic under control.
New infections are running at one-tenth of the level they were at in early May, but fears of a second wave have increased this week as the government was forced to put the city of Leicester back in lockdown, while a cluster of infections at a meat-packing factory in Merthyr Tidfil in Wales has also been observed.
The pound was broadly stable at $1.2450 and at 1.1088 euros.
3. Stocks turn lower despite strong PMIs
European stocks turned lower after a positive start, as better-than-expected surveys of the service sector failed to sustain the optimism generated by the U.S.’s strong close on Thursday.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Stoxx 600 benchmark index was down 0.6%, but was still on course for a gain of over 2.1% for the week. The German DAX was down 0.6% while the U.K. FTSE 100 was down 1.0% and the French CAC 40 down 0.9%.
Concerns about the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S., which posted a second straight day of over 50,000 new infections on Thursday, continue to weigh on the market, fed by suspicions that Thursday’s employment report may have flattered the ongoing labor market reality.
Earlier, consultancy IHS Markit had said its composite purchasing managers index for the euro zone rose to 48.5 in June, above expectations but still below the 50 level that signals growth.
4. India steps up retaliation against China
India stepped up its response to China in the wake of a lethal clash between the two country’s troops in a disputed border region last month.
The government is planning to impose high tariffs on imports of power equipment, minister Raj Kumar Singh was reported by Bloomberg as saying. That’s a sector where Chinese goods, such as solar modules, are currently dominant.
India last week banned a slew of Chinese-developed apps, including short-form video service TikTok and messaging service WeChat. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also called for the country to step up substitution of Chinese imports. China was India’s biggest source of imports last year, and also the source of $164 billion in foreign direct investment.
5. Oil weakens on OPEC+ bickering
Oil prices weakened but remained above $40 a barrel after Angola warned that it wasn’t ready to bring its output into line with quotas agreed under the OPEC+ pact on output restraint, at least until the fourth quarter.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's central bank is expected to cut interest rates to a historic low next week, according to a slim majority in a Reuters poll, as it seeks to protect Southeast Asia's third largest economy from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.
Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) will cut its overnight policy rate  by at least 25 basis points (bps) to 1.75%, according to seven out of the 12 economists polled, with two of them betting on a bigger 50 bps rate reduction.
The remaining five economists expected interest rates to stay at 2.00%, already a record low, after three consecutive rate reductions in as many meetings this year.
Alex Holmes, Asia economist for Capital Economics, was one of the analysts who forecast a bigger move in the upcoming meeting.
""Given the poor outlook for growth and deeply negative inflation, we suspect the BNM will make use of its policy space and opt for a 50bp cut,"" he said.
Malaysia began easing some lockdown measures imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus in May. After growing just 0.7% in the first quarter, BNM said Malaysia is in an ""unprecedented economic crisis"" and was poised for a contraction in April-June.
While trade-reliant Malaysia had begun a ""long and slow"" recovery after some lockdown curbs were relaxed, Holmes said poor external demand and deflation warranted more policy easing.
Malaysia's exports fell 25.5% in May, its biggest drop in 11 years.
The consumer price index fell 2.9% in May from a year earlier, as the economy grappled with subdued consumption for a third straight month.
The government in March rolled out a 260 billion ringgit ($60.69 billion) stimulus package to offset a sharp slowdown in domestic economic activity, and steep declines in tourism and demand for its commodities such as palm oil, crude oil and natural gas.

598,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>",Irish 2020 GDP may fall by 14% in virus second wave: central bank,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Tentative signs of recovery in Ireland's economy means it is likely to shrink by 9% this year if further stringent measures to contain the coronavirus are avoided but almost 14% if they are reimposed, the country's central bank said on Friday.
Ireland, which has had the fastest growing economy in Europe in recent years, mostly completed a careful exit from lockdown this week but much of its services industry is operating at limited capacity and travel from abroad is severely restricted.
The central bank's baseline outcome was similar to the 8.3% drop in gross domestic product (GDP) it forecast in April and would see unemployment fall to 12.5% by the end of the year from 22.5% last month and an average of 7% in 2022 when output would recover to its pre-crisis level.
However in the severe scenario of a resurgence of the virus at some point over the next year, unemployment would average almost 17% in 2020 and GDP would still be about 5% below its pre-crisis level in 2022. 
""While the magnitude of output losses would be lower in a second phase of containment than during the first, such losses would likely be more persistent and thus more damaging to the long run potential growth rate of the economy,"" the central bank said in its quarterly economic bulletin.
Both scenarios assume neighbouring Britain agrees a free trade agreement with the European Union with no tariffs and quotas on goods applying from January 2021.
Such an outcome would knock just under 1 percentage point off the growth rate of the economy in 2021 whereas a move to World Trade Organisation terms on Jan. 1 could cause significant economic disruption and a hit of almost 3 percentage points next year, the central bank predicted.

Central Bank Director of Economics Mark Cassidy warned that the crisis could widen the rural and urban economic divide and that while more stimulus may be required to boost the recovery, the new government would also have to lay out a credible return to much lower and sustainable deficit and debt positions.

599,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 05:40PM ET</span>","Fed balance sheet shrinks further, and still no Main Street loans","(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve's massive stash of bonds and other assets slipped for a third straight week to its smallest size since mid-May, data released by the central bank on Thursday showed.
Meanwhile, the central bank has still made no loans under its two-week old Main Street lending facility, meant to extend easy credit to small and mid-sized businesses that cannot get it elsewhere, the data showed. 
It is not entirely clear why, amid a deep and steep recession, the loans have not drawn more interest. When the Fed first proposed it, staff worked urgently on standing it up as thousands of letters poured in with suggestions for how to make it more useful. The central bank tweaked its plan in response to many of those suggestions. 
But since the onset of the coronavirus crisis, financial conditions have eased, making credit more easily available. That has been in no small part due to the Fed's other actions, including a raft of other credit and lending facilities as well as billions of dollars of bond-buying that drove its balance sheet to record size last month.
As of July 1, the Fed's total balance sheet size declined by about $74 billion to $7.06 trillion versus $7.13 trillion a week earlier, led by a roughly $50 billion fall in outstanding currency swaps with foreign central banks. 
That was a fifth straight weekly drop and a signal of an easing U.S. dollar crunch that had been an early feature of the financial strains caused by the coronavirus crisis.

Repurchase agreements fell to $61 billion, the lowest since the Fed restarted intervening in short-term lending markets in September.

600,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 04:27PM ET</span>",Latin America Fund Readying $6.8 Billion in Support Amid Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- The Latin American Reserve Fund is considering a bond sale of as much as $4.35 billion, its largest ever, to fund loans to central banks in the region as they battle the sharpest economic downturn in decades.
The organization, which normally uses contributions from members to make loans in times of crisis, would issue the bonds in international debt markets, according to Jose Dario Uribe, president of the fund, known by its Spanish acronym FLAR. It will be ready to tap markets within two months, but the amount it ends up seeking will depend on the borrowing needs of its eight member countries, he said in a telephone interview from Bogota.
The proceeds would be added to FLAR’s own financing, giving it a total of as much as $6.8 billion to lend to central banks that face balance-of-payments problems due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Members, which include Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela, would be able to tap a five-year line of credit with a three-year grace period. Thus far, none have requested a loan, he said.
“Currently, the region is the new global epicenter of the pandemic and the contagion peak has not been reached yet,” Uribe said. “Governments in the region are trying to do their best amid the uncertainty, based on their own view of the pandemic and on the public sector funding limits faced by each country.”
More than 2.65 million people have tested positive for the disease in Latin America and the Caribbean, with deaths rising to nearly 119,000, according to a tally by Bloomberg. Lockdowns aimed at stemming the spread of the virus have crippled economies. Even as some countries start to reopen, the region faces a contraction of 9.4% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Central banks have slashed policy rates and intervened in capital markets to provide liquidity. “The shock of the Covid pandemic has been unprecedented in recent history,” said Uribe, who served as the governor of Colombia’s central bank from 2005 to 2017. “Central banks have responded forcefully and innovatively, using instruments they have never used before.”
FLAR most recently provided a $368.8 million line of credit to Ecuador in 2018. Moody’s Investors Service, which gives the fund an investment grade Aa2 rating, in March changed its outlook to negative, citing the risk from a $436 million loan it made to the Venezuelan central bank in 2018. Venezuela has paid its debt in its entirety, Uribe said.
FLAR is the latest entity to offer foreign exchange relief to Latin American central banks. The IMF has agreed to a $107 billion credit line to four countries in the region.
The bond sale would be the first time since 2005 the fund has tapped international debt markets.

605,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 02:50PM ET</span>",Investors rethink yield curve control horizon as Fed raises doubts,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are dialing back expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve may soon move to implement yield curve control, with some of them welcoming skepticism from the central bank in considering such a move. 
Federal Reserve minutes released on Wednesday showed serious questions were raised about the strategy. Some bond market players had become increasingly convinced that one of the Fed's next moves would be to cap yields at a specific point on the curve, by buying 2- or 3-year maturities for example.
""The simple reason the Fed will be skeptical is that you are asking a central bank to embark on a very risky change in policy, and it's not clear that where it has been attempted, it actually works,"" said Andrew Sheets, chief cross-asset strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). 
The Fed's discussion has centered on whether to import the sort of long-term interest rate targeting currently used by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). 
Various Fed members have talked about yield curve control the past couple of months. In May, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida and New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) said yield curve control could be a tool to complement forward guidance. 
Yields on two-year, three-year, five-year and seven-year issues have fallen since the March stock market sell-off and since Fed officials started talking about yield curve control.
For a graphic on Yield control by stealth:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jznpnzjaxpl/Pasted%20image%201593706556741.png
""I think there was a subset of market participants that saw (yield curve control) by September as a foregone conclusion,"" said John Roberts at NatWest Markets, who added that the front-end of the U.S. Treasury curve ""cheapened a bit following the release of the minutes, so it’s possible some were unwinding YCC trades"". 
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a research note Wednesday that they no longer expect yield curve control to be introduced at the Fed's September meeting, although they still expect the committee to recognize the policy as an option for the future in its framework review.
Fed officials did appear to favor crafting some promises about the future - in effect making a pledge not to raise rates until some goal is met.
""What they made very clear is (yield curve control) is not their first tool of choice, it is ahead of negative interest rates but behind explicit outcome-based forward guidance,"" said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial Group. 
Controlling bond yields by purchasing certain maturities of U.S. Treasuries would keep yields where the Fed desires and help keep credit and business lending rates low.
The expectation for yield curve control has come as the U.S. Treasury has greatly increased borrowing. It announced in May plans to borrow nearly $3 trillion in the second quarter, more than five times larger than the previous record, while the July-September quarter would see borrowing of $677 billion.

https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvzwnlkpw/Pasted%20image%201593706697566.png
Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets in Boston, said he would take yield curve control ""off my plate for 2020 unless we really see yields rise,"" adding that if yields in the 3-7-year part of the curve were to get ""out of control, particularly given how much issuance the U.S. Treasury has been doing, then the market would wind up more concerned."" 

Still, the focus on yield curve control has ""basically meant that the Fed has already accidentally implemented it,"" said Jon Hill, U.S. rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets, citing five-years yields hitting all-time lows on Tuesday.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's emergency payments to low-paid, informal workers hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis stands at around 254 billion reais ($48 billion), more than double all 2020 discretionary spending, a senior Economy Ministry official said on Thursday.
Special Secretary Waldery Rodrigues also said that new measures to protect jobs are being drawn up and will be announced soon, while a temporary reduction of the 'IOF' tax on credit card transactions may be extended too. 
Rodrigues was speaking after the ministry drastically revised its fiscal outlook, which now incorporates significantly higher debt and deficits due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on government spending and tax revenues.
Crisis-fighting expenditure is now expected to have a 521 billion reais impact on the primary budget balance, the ministry said, up from 418 billion reais previously. 
These new forecasts factor in the extended emergency payments to low-paid, informal workers for a further two months, the cost of which will probably be around 100 billion reais, Rodrigues said.
President Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday signed a decree to extend the emergency stipends, a popular and crucial program for millions of the country's poorest and most vulnerable people, but which has added to concerns about the surging government deficit.
The Economy Ministry's emergency measures are unlikely to include a further extension of tax deferrals, however. 

""Delaying tax payments is not an amnesty. Therefore, they will have to be collected when the they are due,"" the ministry said in a written response to journalists after being asked about the issue.

She might have annoyed the president in hesitating, but the German chancellor finally has an answer.
“This is about cooperation where ever it’s possible,” Merkel told reporters on Thursday. “Even if there are differences of opinion on certain things, whoever fights for multilateralism -- and I am doing that -- has the duty to make their contribution.”
Until now, Merkel has refrained from committing to a meeting face to face. Via her spokesman, she’d cited concerns about the pandemic and the travel it would entail as a reason for caution. Mere days after her perceived snub, Trump announced he was pulling out a significant number of U.S. troops stationed in Germany since World War II.
Trump has since then been trying to reschedule a G-7 meeting slated for June and now scheduled for late summer. At a news conference, Merkel was asked how eager she would be to come to the U.S. after CNN reported that Trump called her “stupid.”
She did not address the insult, but did speak to her sense of responsibility.
Merkel explained that she -- and other world leaders committed to the global order -- have an obligation to meet with their counterparts, even in the midst of strong disagreements.
Her comments carry weight, as the head of the strongest economy in Europe and a veteran in the international arena after 15 years in power.
The relationship between Washington and Berlin has deteriorated over the last three years, with the U.S. announcing last month that it could impose tariffs on $3.1 billion of products from Germany and other European countries over a trade dispute. Trump says Germany is “delinquent” on defense spending.
As U.S. elections in November draw nearer, Merkel is said to be bracing herself for more provocative policies from Trump.

614,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Who's to blame for Wirecard? Germany passes the buck,"By John O'Donnell
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's accountancy watchdog has denied blame for failing to spot problems at collapsed payments firm Wirecard, the latest in a string of agencies to shirk responsibility following the country's biggest accounting scandal.
The implosion of what was seen as a German success story once worth $28 billion has caused major embarrassment with experts and politicians criticising what they see as a hands-off approach on the part of the authorities.
Wirecard filed for insolvency last week owing creditors almost $4 billion after disclosing a 1.9 billion euro ($2.1 billion) hole in its accounts that its auditor EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud.
Allegations of fraud at Wirecard had been doing the rounds for years though German prosecutors focused on investigating the investors and journalists who had highlighted irregularities rather than the company.
As a financial technology firm, albeit one that owned a bank, Wirecard was long considered as being in a grey area when it came to traditional banking supervision - and that ambiguity is being seized on by various authorities to shift the blame.
Germany's financial regulator BaFin has been quick to say that central banks also had a say in how Wirecard was supervised while the company's home state of Bavaria has said it was not responsible either because Wirecard was not a financial firm.
Following allegations of fraud in a report published in 2016, the authorities twice discussed whether to tighten supervision of Wirecard but took no action.
Early last year, BaFin also asked Germany's accounting watchdog - the privately-owned Financial Reporting Enforcement Panel (FREP) - to examine Wirecard's accounts, but the report had yet to be delivered by the time the company collapsed.
""Tracking down accounting fraud and investigations are not part of our tasks,"" FREP said in a statement late on Wednesday, arguing that its powers were limited and state agencies such as prosecutors had greater clout.
'PACK A PUNCH'
FREP, whose stated mission is to examine the accounts of public companies to contribute to truthful and transparent accounting, said it had investigated Wirecard as fast as possible and regularly informed BaFin of progress.
FREP, which has 14 employees to cover 550 publicly listed companies, assigned one staff member to examine Wirecard's accounts, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Germany has since said it will cancel its contract with the watchdog.
In a FREP brochure published in 2015, a BaFin official, Elisabeth Roegele, applauded the cooperation between the bodies as allowing Germany to ""pack a punch"" in Europe. ""BaFin is the German voice of enforcement,"" she wrote.
Bavaria's local government, which monitors financial companies to prevent money laundering, said it wasn't in charge of keeping tabs on Wirecard as it did not fit the definition of a financial company, a spokeswoman said.
Prosecutors in Munich have also rejected criticism they were slow to look at Wirecard, saying they started to investigate recently, as soon as they had evidence of wrongdoing.
Matthew Earl, who bet on a fall in Wirecard's shares and co-authored a 2016 report that alleged fraud, criticised the response of the German authorities.
""BaFin's approach was to go after the critics,"" said Earl. ""There is a much more grown up approach in the United States or Britain. The regulators are more open minded. On the continent in Europe, they are more parochial.""

EY meanwhile, which has been heavily criticised after auditing Wirecard's accounts for a decade, said it had been duped by the company: ""Even the most robust ... audit procedures may not uncover a collusive fraud.""

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain will approve 50 billion euros ($56.4 billion) as part of a new set of measures aimed at boosting companies' investment capacity and solvency in an attempt to revive the coronavirus-hit economy, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Thursday.
The announcement was part of other proposals such as tax reform partly focused on raising taxes on larger companies rather than smaller ones.
Sanchez said in an interview with La Sexta on Thursday that the new measures were ""linked to (boosting) solvency and investment.""
A government source told Reuters earlier that Spain would approve this package at an extraordinary cabinet meeting on Friday.
""Measures are aimed at improving the financial structure of companies to also lower their risk of defaulting on their payments with lenders,"" the source said, adding that financial instruments were still being discussed.
In March, the government approved state-backed credit lines of up to 100 billion euros to help support mainly small and mid-sized companies and self-employed against the fallout from the pandemic.
Last month, Bank of Spain Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos said mechanisms were needed to encourage the growth of small and mid-sized companies to reduce their higher borrowing costs compared to European peers.
EU BATTLE
Policymakers in Europe have been discussing options for getting more equity, rather than debt, into businesses but few countries have ready-made vehicles for funnelling mass investment into SMEs.
While several governments have set aside funds for capital injections into large companies, they are having to think up innovative options for smaller firms.
On Thursday, Sanchez said it was ""imperative and necessary"" for the European Union to reach an agreement on a commmon recovery fund by July, but warned that negotiations were set to be a ""big battle.""
EU members agreed in June that economic action was urgently needed but remain divided over the value of loans or grants to be provided and if the program should last two or three years.
""We believe it should be four years,"" Sanchez said, adding that passing a 2021 budget would depend heavily on the outcome of the talks.
After years of political instability, Sanchez's government has failed to pass its own budget, instead rolling over one from 2018 drafted by his conservative predecessor Mariano Rajoy.
Sanchez said he would meet with his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte, an advocate for a smaller, loans-based program, on July 16 to discuss the fund.

616,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 08:18AM ET</span>",EU to Unveil Compromise Plan for Recovery Fund Amid Deep Splits,"(Bloomberg) -- European Union governments remain deeply divided over a proposed 750 billion-euro ($847 billion) plan aimed at jointly financing an economic recovery, and the prospects for a deal at a key summit later this month are uncertain, according to a senior official.
European Council president Charles Michel will unveil a compromise proposal next week in an effort to bridge divisions, said the official, who asked not to be named, in line with policy. Michel, who chairs the summits of EU leaders, will propose keeping the overall size the same, but the official declined to say if the current balance of grants to loans -- 500 billion versus 250 billion, respectively -- would change.
A bloc of richer member states, led by the Netherlands, wants to substantially reduce or eliminate the amount distributed in the form of grants that will be collectively repaid as of 2027 from the joint EU budget. Michel will propose offering the wealthier nations rebates that would limit the amount they contribute to the EU budget in an effort to win over their approval for the deal.
The proposed package, backed by Germany and France, could mark a giant leap in the European unification process, as it would see the EU’s executive arm issue billions of euros in debt on behalf of the entire bloc. While European markets have rallied on the expectation that the plan will eventually be approved, the proposal is mired in controversy, with nations at loggerheads over the size, the allocation and the conditions attached to the disbursement of funds.
Under the original proposal by the European Commission, Italy would get almost 82 billion euros in grants, making it the single largest beneficiary of the package, followed by Spain with 77.3 billion euros. In contrast, Northern countries, which are also projected to suffer from a record recession, would get a much smaller share of the pot, with the proposed allocation for Belgium set at 5.5 billion euros.
Following the pushback, Michel will instead propose next week that 70% of the total package is distributed in line with the commission’s proposal, while 30% will be distributed from 2023, depending on the depth of the recession in each country over the next 2 years. Overall, Michel will propose that countries have a total of 3 years to commit the funds to projects and another 3 years to spend it, according to the official.
The conditions attached to the disbursement of the money will also be strengthened, so as to make sure it’s used to help Europe’s climate and digital transition, the official said. There will also be safeguards against sliding democratic standards in member states such as Poland and Hungary, though the official declined to elaborate on the specifics of the mechanism that will be proposed for discontinuing disbursements in such cases.
In another concession to Europe’s rich North, Michel will propose modest cuts to the regular EU budget which runs at over 1 trillion euros over the next 7 years. The proposal is likely to trigger a pushback from Eastern EU members, which benefit the most in agricultural subsidies from the budget.
Michel’s proposal will form the basis for negotiations between leaders in a summit scheduled for July 17 and 18 in Brussels. The official didn’t exclude that another summit may be needed this month to bridge divisions, though he insisted that no such meeting is planned at this stage.

617,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 08:00AM ET</span>",Ukraine Cancels Eurobond Sale After Central Bank Chief Quits,"(Bloomberg) -- Ukraine canceled a $1.75 billion Eurobond sale after the head of its central bank unexpectedly stepped down citing sustained political pressure against him and his colleagues.
The shock departure late Wednesday came just as the debt was being priced, with the hryvnia and existing Eurobonds plunging when they opened for trading on Thursday. The news also coincides with rising Covid-19 infections in the eastern European country and follows the agreement just weeks ago on $5 billion of aid from the International Monetary Fund.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy sought to reassure markets Thursday but to little avail. The hryvnia weakened 1.3% to its lowest level against the dollar since April and the yield on the government’s dollar bonds due 2028 jumped 33 basis points to 7.42%.
“Ensuring the central bank’s independence remains our priority,” Zelenskiy’s office said.
The words will also be scant comfort to Governor Yakiv Smoliy, who’s complained for months about pressure -- including from Zelenskiy and his lawmakers -- to lower interest rates and aid exporters by facilitating a weaker national currency.
Some members of his ruling party have even sided with billionaire Igor Kolomoisky’s efforts to overturn the central bank-led nationalization of the country’s biggest lender, Privatbank, four years ago.
“For a long time, systematic political pressure was applied to the central bank,” said Smoliy, who was appointed in 2018 and is widely respected by foreign investors. “This makes it impossible for me to efficiently fulfill my duty as governor and to cooperate with other government bodies.”
His exit was accepted by Zelenskiy, who must also pick a successor, and now needs to be approved by parliament. The central bank said the rest of its board would remain in place.
Smoliy, who joined the bank in 2014 after Ukraine toppled its Kremlin-backed leader, is credited for helping tame inflation, keep the hryvnia stable through the pandemic and negotiate the recent IMF deal. He oversaw a reduction in benchmark borrowing costs to a post-communist low last month.
‘Important Strides’
“Under his leadership, Ukraine has made important strides in achieving price stability, amply demonstrating that an independent central bank is a key element of modern macroeconomic policy-making,” the IMF said.
While the departure increased uncertainty and raised questions about the bank’s independence and the IMF program, investors will “forget fast” if Smoliy’s replacement is market friendly, according to Anton Hauser, a fund manager at Erste Asset Management in Vienna who participated in the pulled deal and said he’ll want to take part when it’s reinstated.
“The overall positive trajectory in Ukraine, the high global-risk appetite and the low yield environment will support Ukrainian bonds going forward,” he said.
Central banks around the world have faced increasing political pressure in recent years to adopt policies that are more friendly to economic growth. Before the pandemic, U.S. President Donald Trump regularly chided Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell over monetary policy. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ousted his central bank chief in 2019 for not lowering interest rates aggressively enough.
In Ukraine, Smoliy isn’t the first governor to face pressure. Protesters hounded his predecessor, Valeriya Gontareva, who on one occasion saw a coffin containing a cutout of her wearing a prison inmate’s uniform delivered to the central bank’s headquarters. She also alleges Kolomoisky burned down her family home in Kyiv, which he denies.
The bank accused the tycoon in November of orchestrating an intimidation campaign through public demonstrations and negative media coverage in a bid to win back control of Privatbank.
“I want my resignation to be a warning against further attempts to undermine institutional grounds of central bank in Ukraine,” Smoliy said.

619,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday, July 2nd","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- There’s a double-whammy of U.S. jobs data due, with both the official labor market report for June and last week’s jobless claims numbers due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT). The surge in U.S. coronavirus infections continues, with the country registering a record high of 52,000 new cases on Tuesday. U.S. stocks are set to open higher, as traders wait for validation of yesterday’s strong ADP payrolls report,  while Hong Kong’s and Russia’s jump in reaction to political faits accomplis. And oil prices are higher amid continuing confidence in the global market’s rebalancing story. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, July 2nd.
1 Jobs, jobs, jobs...and jobs
If you love jobs data, you’re going to love today. The Labor Department will release not only the weekly jobless claims numbers for the U.S., but also the monthly employment report for June. The latter has been moved up a day because of Friday’s public holiday.
The most up-to-date information will be from the weekly numbers, which are expected to show a further drop in the number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits to 1.355 million from 1.48 million. Continuing claims, which come with a one-week time lag, are expected to fall to 19.0 million.
The more complete data, however, will be the monthly numbers. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have grown by 3.000 million, but the number may have to be seen in the context of a big revision to May’s 2.509 million gain. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 12.3% from 13.3% in May.
2. Reopening on hold as virus cases hit new record high
It’s worth noting that both sets of jobs data will predate the accelerating surge in Covid-19 cases across much of the U.S.  The country posted a new daily record of over 50,000 new infections on Tuesday, and hospitalizations are also on the rise, especially in California and Texas.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has now re-closed one-quarter of its U.S. stores, while McDonald’s is pausing its reopening schedule, according to an internal memo seen by The Wall Street Journal.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard meanwhile issued a stark warning of what could happen if the country fails to bring the virus under control.
“The disease is still quite capable of surprising us,” Bullard told the Financial Times. “Without more granular risk management on the part of the health policy, we could get a wave of substantial bankruptcies and [that] could feed into a financial crisis.”
3. Stocks set to open moderately higher; Musk overtakes Toyota
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher, as the strong rebound in ADP’s private payroll survey and in the Institute of Supply Management’s purchasing managers index on Wednesday outweigh concerns about the state of the medical emergency.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract was up 221 points, or 0.9%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 0.6% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.4%.
The Nasdaq Composite closed at a new record high on Wednesday, while the Dow and S&P have essentially been in a holding pattern since the liquidity-driven rebound topped out in early June.
In the spotlight today will be Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which has surpassed both  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and Toyota in market value in recent days, even though it produces only 4% of what Toyota produces.  Retail-focused stocks will also be sensitive to any further evidence of delayed reopening or closures.
4. Hong Kong, Russian markets shrug off political concerns
Hong Kong stocks rose 2.9%, shrugging off a House vote to impose fresh sanctions on banks that do business with Chinese officials linked to a new law that effectively ends the city’s autonomy.
The U.K. has offered a track to citizenship for 3 million Hong Kong residents, while Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his cabinet would also soon consider proposals offering ‘safe haven’ to Hong Kong residents.
Meanwhile in Russia, the benchmark RTS index rose 2.6% and the ruble strengthened after citizens reportedly voted to endorse constitutional changes that allow President Vladimir Putin to stay in power until 2036.
5. Oil steadies above $40 on rebalancing evidence
Crude oil prices steadied above $40 after inventory data from the U.S. government showed a deeper-than-expected drop in inventories last week.
That suggests that falling production and rising demand are eating into the record stockpiles created during the second quarter at a faster rate than expected. Prices had dipped later amid concerns that the surge in virus cases could derail the reopening of the U.S. economy.
By 6:30 AM, U.S. crude futures were up 0.6% at $40.05 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent futures contract was up 0.6% at $42.27 a barrel.  "

621,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>",Turkish bad loan plan raises concerns among some banks: sources,"By Ebru Tuncay and Jonathan Spicer
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Some Turkish banks are concerned that a ""bad bank"" plan to house billions of dollars of non-performing loans could require them to book large losses, and they want foreign stakeholders involved, seven industry sources told Reuters.
Ernst & Young handed its blueprint for creating an asset management company (AMC) to Turkish bankers last week, three of the sources said, prompting a mixed reaction.
""It's early right now to talk about it, but we are not willing to be a part of this project,"" one senior banker said.
The bad debt problem has been simmering for nearly two years and any further delay in resolving it could leave Turkey's economy more vulnerable ahead of an expected wave of loan losses resulting from the coronavirus crisis.
One argument for creating a bad bank, a path pursued by other countries to clean up after the global financial crisis, is that it frees up bank balance sheets to lend to new projects or businesses and can therefore encourage economic recovery.
At $22 billion, Turkey's non-performing loans (NPLs) have remained high since a 2018 currency crisis laid bare the heavy reliance of construction and energy companies on foreign debt.
With Turkey's normally fast-growing economy expected to contract by as much as 5% this year, S&P Global Ratings forecasts that its NPL ratio could rise as high as 12% by 2021, from 4.5% at present.
Turkey's Banking Association confirmed the report, which it had commissioned, had been completed and sent to banks, but gave no detail. EY declined to comment.
Although details of EY's proposal including the role Ankara might play were unclear, Turkish banks would be expected to shift some of their NPLs into the AMC and jointly manage it.
""If the difference between the book value and the transfer price is significant then some of the banks may opt not to participate,"" Filippo Alloatti, a senior analyst at Hermes Investment Management, said.
Another top banker said there were ""different opinions between lenders"", with some seeing no value in transferring their NPLs, while others said ensuring only modest losses on the loans would be crucial to get banks on board.
Turkish banks mark the value of loans on their books to maturity, making provisions for them depending on how badly impaired they are, effectively how likely a borrower is going to repay or the bank is going to be able to recoup the money.
Turkey's Finance Minister Berat Albayrak last week endorsed the AMC concept after other proposed solutions were shelved by Ankara last year.
Another factor which could help decide whether banks decide to participate in the bad bank is the involvement of stakeholders such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the International Finance Corporation.
The EBRD supported the bad-bank initiative, as well as other solutions, to address Turkey's ""urgent"" NPL issue after much delay, Catherine Bridge Zoller, senior counsel in the EBRD's financial law unit, told Reuters.
However, all industry and government stakeholders must coordinate to adopt regulatory and legal changes that would open the market to foreign investment, Zoller added.

622,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 06:11AM ET</span>",Eyes in the sky: Investors reach for new tools to gauge climate change risk,"By Matthew Green, Karin Strohecker and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - In the twilight years of past civilisations, astrologers would scour the heavens for signs of impending calamity. In an era where climate change is eroding age-old certainties, a new cast of characters is searching for answers in the sky. 
A small but growing network of asset managers, academics, start-up entrepreneurs and campaigners are working to harness an armada of recently deployed satellites to better predict the economic impact of global warming. 
While climate scientists caution that the discipline is in its infancy, advocates say the early findings have one over-riding virtue: dynamiting any remaining complacency about the scale of the disruption that lies in store.
""This is the missing piece of the jigsaw,"" said Michael Hugman, a portfolio manager at London-based asset manager Ninety One, where the fixed-income team runs $44.3 billion of mostly emerging market debt.
""What we can now do is concretely put hard numbers on what climate change means for countries over the next 30 years. This is a whole different way of thinking about risk and return."" 
While investors have long used satellites to track specific metrics such as activity in shopping mall car parks or iron ore shipments, the new approach -- known as ""spatial finance"" -- is far more sweeping in scope. 
It works like this: analysts acquire satellite imagery and other datasets, filter them using algorithms and use the results to project how climate change could affect anything from a single factory to an entire economy.
Unlike standard risk models largely based on historical data, spatial finance aims to anticipate how rising heat could usher in a radically different future. 
Ben Caldecott, director of the Oxford Sustainable Finance Programme, a research unit at the University of Oxford, likens the depth of potential insights to the revolution in biology unlocked by the sequencing of the human genome.
""We've had this massive explosion in Earth observation capabilities that means we can see what's going on on every point of planet Earth, and we can interpret it and use that for financial analysis,"" said Caldecott, who has launched a spatial finance initiative to widen the discipline's applications. 
""What is so transformative is adding another dimension to the information you have as an analyst.""
Asset managers specialising in emerging market debt have been among the first to explore the possibilities, recognising, for example, that more intense hurricanes or heatwaves can upend the finances of countries dependent on agricultural exports.
The results can be sobering. Hugman decided to model how climate change might affect a hypothetical debt restructuring plan for Argentina, which is struggling to pay its creditors. 
He focused on two of the many possible risks -- the prospect of more ambitious global moves to curb deforestation, which could hit farm exports, and more frequent droughts, using numbers based on spatial techniques. The result: what had looked on paper like a viable plan to manage the country's debt was no longer sustainable.
GREEN SWANS
Environmentalists hope such findings can in turn be used to arm governments in Latin America, Africa and Asia with the data they need to identify the most promising investments to cushion populations from climate impacts. 
""What it gives you is a much richer way of engaging with governments,"" said Susanne Schmitt, nature and spatial finance lead at the World Wildlife Fund, an advocacy group.
Working with Hugman and other asset managers, Schmitt aims to leverage spatial finance to mobilise investment in climate-friendly projects such as preserving mangrove swamps or forests.
Others wonder whether developing ever-more specific levels of analysis might prove a double-edged sword, enabling smart investors to offload potentially doomed assets to climate-naive counterparts rather than help the vulnerable. 
""The big question for me is, what happens when particular companies, assets and entire countries are identified as being at risk?"" said Kate Mackenzie, a Sydney-based consultant who has advised companies and regulators on climate change.
""Are those assets sold to markets and buyers who have the same visibility of that risk?"" 
Even before the coronavirus pandemic gave investors a crash course in the fragility of the global economy, concerns were growing over the far bigger dangers posed by the climate crisis.
In January, the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS) published a report warning that markets were ill-equipped to spot so-called ""green swans"" – high-impact environmental shocks.
On climate change, none of the models investors were using captured risks of the ""magnitude we have today"", warned Luiz Pereira da Silva, BIS deputy general manager, speaking on a podcast recorded when the report was launched. 
""We need to use more and more novel approaches, forward-looking scenarios that instead of just trying to replicate the past, extrapolate from the knowledge that we are accumulating with climate scientists,"" he said.
A stack of research has hammered home the scale of the dangers looming by mid-century if greenhouse gas emissions keep growing. In January, the McKinsey Global Institute pointed out that cities in parts of India and Pakistan could be among the first places in the world to experience heatwaves hot enough to kill a healthy human, under a high emissions scenario.
West Africa may see 70-90 more days per year with dangerous levels of heat than at present, according to World Bank data. And even if emissions start to fall moderately, rising sea-levels are projected to hit land in China, Bangladesh and India that is now home to 171 million people, according to a study by Climate Central.
ALGORITHMS AT WORK
With investor concerns over climate growing, entrepreneurs have spied an opportunity to refine a torrent of data streaming down from space into products for money managers.
In Britain, new spatial finance start-ups include Oxford Earth Observation and Sust Global. Based in Charlottesville, Virginia, Astraea Inc mines data from some of the 1,500 earth-observing satellites in orbit at any given time.
The company is working with Caldecott's spatial finance initiative to create an open-source database of all the world's cement factories, which could encourage investors to pressure the most polluting operators to clean up their act. 
""We give you the tools to be able to train an algorithm to look for specific things and then apply that across whatever geographic scale you want, "" said Chief Executive Brendan Richardson. 
With investors in emerging markets increasingly engaging in talks with governments about sustainability, some are exploring whether risks identified using spatial finance could give the discussions more teeth. 
""We invest our clients' assets for the long term ... where climate change and environmental factors will actually be significant,"" said Mary-Therese Barton, head of emerging market debt at Pictet Asset Management. ""That's where the dialogue becomes really important.""
Long before big data and space exploration, in 8th century Baghdad, a star-gazer known as Masha'allah ibn Athari inspired generations of future astrologers with a theory that the cycles of Jupiter and Saturn predicted global upheaval.
While none of the spatial finance start-ups claim prophetic powers, climate scientists advise caution. The climate-related shocks that tend to cause the biggest market gyrations are generally extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, which cannot be predicted with any real degree of precision. 
Andy Pitman, a climate scientist at University of New South Wales in Australia, says there is no question that investors need to grapple with climate risk, but worries that some companies might be overselling what they can do. 

""It's probably a 10-year moonshot to close this gap between what businesses want to know, and what climate scientists can reliably provide them,"" Pitman said.

Its economy already battered by the coronavirus pandemic, the PA, which has limited self-rule in the West Bank under interim peace deals, last month rejected handovers of taxes that Israel collects on its behalf.
The transfers, about $190 million a month, make up more than half of the PA's budget and stem from duties on imports that reach the West Bank and Gaza via Israeli ports. The PA snubbed the taxes after declaring bilateral agreements with Israel null in May.
Awaiting a green light from its U.S. ally and saying more talks with Washington were needed, Israel did not meet its July 1 target date for the start of a cabinet debate on extending sovereignty to the West Bank's Jewish settlements and Jordan Valley.
But the economic impact of the PA's protest against annexation was already being felt.
""Due to the rejection of the tax money and overall decline in income...the state's revenues have declined by 80 percent,"" Palestinian Finance Minister Shukri Bishara said, also referring to funds lost during the pandemic.
He announced that many of the PA's 132,000 employees would see their wages cut by half, not to fall below a minimum of 1,750 shekels ($507) a month.
Analysts say the health crisis and financial disputes with Israel could drive the PA to financial collapse. After a surge in new coronavirus cases, the PA has placed several West Bank towns under lockdown, which it plans to expand to the entire territory beginning on Friday.
Most PA employees are in the West Bank, with 30,000 in Hamas-run Gaza.

The current situation means that ratings don’t fully reflect the credit health of issuers, according to a document from major raters submitted to India’s central bank Wednesday and seen by Bloomberg. That underscores challenges for a country mired in a credit crisis triggered by the 2018 default of a top-rated shadow lender.
The surge in these unreliable ratings came even before the spread of the coronavirus pushed India’s economy toward its first contraction in more than four decades. The downturn has made the accuracy of credit ratings more crucial than ever to understand the capital position of the nation’s banks and keep another major one from requiring a bailout.
India already has the world’s biggest pile of soured loans, and with the pandemic bad debt will worsen to the highest since 1999, according to S&P Global Ratings.
There’s been a surge in the number of ratings where the companies don’t provide adequate information for the assessment or stop paying the rating firm’s fees, according to the document sent to the Reserve Bank of India. That ratio has more than doubled to 47% of the total in the two years to March 2020, and bank loans make 95% of such ratings.
The rating companies recommend that they withdraw a credit score 12 to 15 months after the issuer being placed in the non-cooperating category.
The RBI didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
India Ratings & Research Pvt. declined to comment, and another six ratings companies, including Crisil Ltd. and ICRA Ltd., didn’t immediately reply to emails.
Not Reliable
According to a 2016 circular from the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets regulator, the rating firms have to continue to assess these companies even when there’s non-cooperation. They have to use the best available information, which can even be irrelevant old corporate data to rate them and then highlight in their credit reports that the issuers aren’t cooperating.
“An issuer-not-cooperating rating by a credit rating agency does not reflect a reliable opinion on the credit quality of the entity,” the document said. “By maintaining the issuer-not-cooperating rating beyond a reasonable period, neither the entity’s nor the investors’ interests are served.”

KYIV (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund urged Ukraine on Thursday to maintain the independence of the central bank after Governor Yakiv Smoliy unexpectedly resigned, citing ""systematic political pressure"". 
The negative fallout from Smoliy's resignation prompted the finance ministry to say it was not going ahead with a planned offering of dollar-denominated Eurobonds. 
Smoliy's resignation from the National Bank of Ukraine risks derailing a $5 billion deal agreed with the IMF last month to fight an economic slump exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Despite reassurances from President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's office on Wednesday, Smoliy's resignation sent sovereign bonds down by more than two cents and the local hryvnia currency down to its lowest level since April against the dollar.
The central bank has maintained its reputation among investors as a respected institution, in a country where corruption remains entrenched and state bodies vulnerable to vested interests.
""Under his leadership, Ukraine has made important strides in achieving price stability, amply demonstrating that an independent central bank is a key element of modern macroeconomic policymaking,"" an IMF spokesman said in a statement.
""That is why the independence of the NBU is at the centre of Ukraine's Fund-supported programme, and why it must be maintained under his successor.""
Zelenskiy accepted Smoliy's resignation, meaning parliament must now formally vote on whether to dismiss him.
No successor has been named although various names have been floated in the local media, including the head of the central bank's supervisory council. 
""It's a big negative given the credibility the central bank has built up in terms of inflation targeting and central bank independence under the IMF programme,"" said Trieu Pham, EM Sovereign Debt Strategist at ING. ""Now everyone is questioning what's going on and the risks attached to it.""
The central bank has previously complained of being subjected to pressure, including over its decision in 2016 to nationalise Ukraine's largest lender, PrivatBank, which was formerly co-owned by businessman Ihor Kolomoisky, a backer of Zelenskiy.
Zelenskiy has denied any favouritism towards Kolomoisky and publicly expressed support for the central bank's independence.
Kolomoisky has fought a protracted legal battle against the central bank and the government to win back control of PrivatBank, which was nationalised after the central bank said shady lending practices had pushed it towards insolvency.
Kolomoisky denies any wrongdoing. Kolomoisky's allies in parliament earlier this year tried to scupper legislation, demanded by the IMF, that would prevent him from regaining control of PrivatBank. 

Alexander Dubinsky, a lawmaker who was a journalist on Kolomoisky's 1+1 channel before entering parliament in Zelenskiy's Servant of the People party, has pushed for parliament to formally investigate the central bank.

629,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>",What’s on the Table for Next Round of U.S. Virus Relief,"(Bloomberg) -- With a resurgence of the coronavirus threatening a nascent rebound of the U.S. economy, the White House and Congress are under increased pressure to come to terms on another round of stimulus.
What the next stimulus bill will look like is very much an open question. House Democrats packed a comprehensive list of demands into a $3.5 trillion measure passed in May. Senate Republicans have dismissed that plan and are discussing a package of as much as $1 trillion in total spending.
Negotiations won’t begin in earnest until the Senate returns from recess on July 20.
Economic data over the next month, including Thursday’s jobs report, will shape much of the debate in Washington.
“Any phase four economic package must prioritize pro-growth economic measures that incentivize employers and our great American work force for re-employment and a return to the labor market,” Judd Deere (NYSE:DE), a White House spokesman, said in an email.
Most of the discussion in Congress and the Trump administration about the next round of relief has focused on several key items: Additional aid for businesses and the unemployed; another round of checks to individuals; liability limits for employers; health care and infrastructure funding; and aid to state and local governments.
Here’s the state of play on the leading stimulus proposals:
Business Relief
There already is plenty of bipartisan support for the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, which is designed to forestall job cuts at small businesses struggling during the pandemic.
Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, said Wednesday that bipartisan negotiators are close to a deal on a second round for the program with some adjustments.
Senate Small Business Committee Chairman Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, is reconvening the task force that helped create the PPP to come up with a plan that would expand the use of funds, including allowing chambers of commerce to apply, setting aside $25 billion for businesses with fewer than 10 employees. Rubio also said he’s considering adding more PPP funding to help minority-owned businesses and other firms in “under-served communities.”
Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, and other Senate Democrats have introduced a bill that would extend the PPP application deadline to Dec. 31 or longer while creating a new option for a second loan for borrowers with fewer than 100 employees that have lost at least half their revenue because of the pandemic.
There are also proposals for tax incentives to stimulate demand such as for travel and restaurant meals. President Donald Trump has said he favors such incentives, but diving into tax law would complicate the legislation.
Unemployment Benefits
The most difficult talks will be over whether to extend a $600-per- week boost to unemployment benefits approved by Congress in March that expires July 31. Democrats have sought to extend it into next year with possible phase-outs linked to improving state economic numbers.
Congressional Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal said Wednesday that the top priority for liberals is expanding that and other benefits for the jobless.
But Republicans contend that in many parts of the country, the boost is providing a perverse incentive for workers to remain unemployed since they earn more when out of work.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday called the bonus “a mistake,” while saying there should be “adequate” benefits for the unemployed. The White House also is opposed to the bigger payment.
Some Republicans suggest that one possible solution could be to cut the added amount to $200 or less.
“The way forward is some kind of compromise. The amount was just way too much,” said North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer.
Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, is proposing providing a $450 weekly bonus for individuals who return to work. Portman argues that will ensure there are fewer instances where staying on unemployment is more lucrative than working.
As a counter-point, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon this week offered up an expansive and permanent change to the unemployment benefits system. They would provide the $600 boost until a state’s three-month average total unemployment rate falls below 11%. The benefit amount would reduce by $100 for every percentage point decrease in the state’s unemployment rate, until the rate falls below 6%.
Direct Payments
Republicans are showing openness to another round of direct payments to individuals. House Democrats in their May bill proposed repeating the $1,200 payments to individuals making less than $75,000 per year, with as much as $6,000 per family.
Trump on Wednesday endorsed the idea, telling Fox Business, “I want the money to get there quickly and in a non-complicated fashion.” And the amount, he said, should be larger than what Democrats have proposed, though he wasn’t specific.
That aligns him with liberal Democrats, who have also proposed government-funded hazard pay for essential workers and direct housing assistance, which should ease the way for it to be included.
Yet some of Trump’s most conservative allies like Ted Yoho of Florida said this week they want no more relief spending at all. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has called for a “more targeted” approach. Lawmakers said the final bill could tighten provisions to restrict it to low-income individuals or a requirement that applicants show income losses to get the aid.
Employer Liability
The employer liability shield that McConnell calls his “red line” in stimulus negotiations will be contentious in negotiations with Democrats.
Texas Senator John Cornyn, who is drafting the liability language for release in July, said in an interview this month that it would allow employers to choose which government coronavirus safety guidelines to follow in order to be shielded from lawsuits if their customers or workers contract the virus.
Employers could look to the best available guidance, whether it be from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or a different federal, state or local governmental entity. Cornyn said there are conflicts among the safe-practices guidelines available to employers, and that companies should be allowed to make their own determination.
The White House also is behind liability limits.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Schumer have said they won’t agree to a lawsuit immunity provision for employers that is crafted too broadly. They are seeking to prod the administration to issue detailed Covid-19 guidance to employers on how to safely protect their workers.
State and Local Aid
Democrats in both chambers state and local governments need about $1 trillion in aid, about the same amount Republicans say they’re willing to spend on an overall stimulus plan. They are backed by many governors and mayors, who’ve warned that millions of public employees, including essential workers, could lose their jobs because tax revenue has fallen while expenses have risen.
Republicans, particularly McConnell, have suggested such aid would amount to a gift to Democrat-led states that were facing budget pressures even before the pandemic.
The White House has opened the door to some state aid, specifically for expenses directly related to the pandemic, but has indicated it doesn’t want the measures to turn into a rescue for states with pre-existing financial pressures, such as pension shortfalls.
“I don’t think the Republicans want to be in a position where they bail out states that are, that have been mismanaged over a long period of time,” Trump told the New York Post in May.
Health Care and Infrastructure
The bill is likely to have some provisions to finance direct efforts to fight the Covid-19 pandemic but the shape of that is very much in dispute. Pelosi has called for a massive expansion of testing and contact tracing as well as a national response plan and the House bill has $75 billion for this effort.
Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri is taking the lead in crafting a Republican proposal for this aspect of the bill. He said Wednesday that the stimulus legislation would contain a robust health care section that addresses testing and vaccine development.
“We are going to be asking what kind of money do you need once you have vaccines particularly and tests and therapeutics as well that they are generally free and fairly available to people” he said.
Portman said the recent jump in cases in many states has more Republicans embracing the idea of strong infusion of funds into health care. “There’s a realization that we need to do more,” he said.
While there has been much enthusiasm -- expressed by Trump and others -- of putting infrastructure spending in the next round of virus relief, that is appearing less and less likely to be included. Some Republicans argue the economic benefits of spending on projects such as roads and broadband, would be too slow to give the economy the quick jolt needed.

GVK Group, which has interests in energy, resources, airports and hospitality, led a consortium that formed a joint venture - Mumbai International Airport Ltd - with the Airport Authority of India (AAI) in 2006 to modernise and operate the airport under a revenue-sharing agreement.
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) late on Wednesday released a complaint alleging that GVK's chairman, Gunupati Venkata Krishna Reddy, ""connived"" with his son and some AAI officials to siphon off funds meant for the development of the airport, one of country's busiest.
GVK, AAI and Mumbai International Airport Ltd did not respond to requests for comment. Shares in the group's flagship company,  GVK Power & Infrastructure  (NS:GVKP), were down 4.5% at 0810 GMT on Thursday. 
According to the CBI, Mumbai International Airport generated fake work contracts during 2017-18 and transferred funds to several companies for real-estate developments that were not executed.
Their modus operandi also included misusing the airport's surplus reserves, inflating its expenditure, and underreporting its revenue, the police alleged. 
In October, GVK signed binding agreements to raise more than $1 billion in its airports holding company from Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board and Indian government-backed National Investment & Infrastructure Fund.

It is also developing another airport near Mumbai.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) food priceindex, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 93.2 points last month, up 2.4% on May.
FAO said it had rebased all its indices, shifting the base period to 2014-16 from a previous 2002-04.
Amid continued market uncertainty, the prices of vegetable oils, sugar and dairy products rebounded to multi-month highs following sharp declines in May, while in the cereals and meat indices, most prices remained under downward pressure.
FAO also revised up its forecast for the 2020 cereal season by some 9.3 million tonnes, foreseeing global output of almost 2.790 billion tonnes -- a 3.0% increase on 2019's record harvest. The bulk of the monthly increase reflected an upward revision to Australia's wheat production estimates.

633,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Indonesia considers putting banking regulation under central bank - sources,"By Maikel Jefriando and Gayatri Suroyo
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo is considering issuing an emergency decree to return banking regulation to the central bank's remit, amid concern about how the COVID-19 pandemic is exposing strain in the financial sector, sources told Reuters.
Bank Indonesia (BI) acted as regulator and supervisor of banks in Southeast Asia's largest economy until the end of 2013 when the Financial Services Authority (OJK) assumed the role.
The president has been considering returning the role to BI due to dissatisfaction about OJK's performance during the pandemic, said two people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.
OJK was established under a 2011 law to oversee financial institutions. It was modelled on Britain's then financial services regulatory structure.
Indonesia is now looking at the French structure, which has an independent administrative authority under the central bank which oversees banking, one of the people said.
""BI is very happy about this ... but there will be an addition to its KPIs: it will be told to not only look after currency and inflation, but also unemployment,"" said the second person, referring to key performance indicators (KPIs).
Neither BI nor a spokesman for Widodo responded to requests for comment. An OJK spokesman declined to comment at this time on the possible transfer of regulatory authority.
The OJK spokesman said the OJK began urging banks to restructure loans on Feb. 26, and introduced incentives toward that end on March 16, thereby preventing the need for banks to prepare sizeable provisions for bad loans.
DISBAND
The development comes as the government negotiates central bank help to fund a fiscal deficit that is ballooning due to its COVID-19 response.
At a June 18 cabinet meeting, Widodo said he would reshuffle his cabinet or disband government agencies if he felt they had not done enough to tackle crises brought about by the pandemic.
Indonesia's supreme audit board earlier this year called OJK's supervisory role ""weak"", pointing to loopholes in its oversight of seven banks. OJK said in response it would improve.
The seven included mid-sized PT  Bank Bukopin  Tbk (JK:BBKP) which last month said it had a negative cash flow and was limiting withdrawals.
Bukopin this week said it planned a rights issue after which South Korea's KB Kookmin Bank would own a controlling stake. OJK also urged customers of Bukopin and other banks to ignore social media posts calling on them to withdraw deposits.
The banking industry on aggregate is secure, OJK Chairman Wimboh Santoso said on Monday, citing a higher capital adequacy ratio than international standards at 22.2% in May, a non-performing loan ratio of 3.01% and high liquidity indicators.
OJK expects 15.12 million debtors will need to restructure 1,373.7 trillion rupiah ($96.03 billion) worth of loans due to the pandemic, with 695.34 trillion rupiah being restructured as of June 22.

""Without more granular risk management on the part of the health policy, we could get a wave of substantial bankruptcies and (that) could feed into a financial crisis,"" Bullard said in an interview with the newspaper on Wednesday. (https://on.ft.com/31AlcUF)
He warned of ""twists and turns"" in the health crisis and said ""it's probably prudent to keep our lending facilities in place for now, even though it's true that liquidity has improved dramatically in financial markets.""
New U.S. COVID-19 cases rose by nearly 50,000 on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally, marking the biggest one-day spike since the start of the pandemic. The surge in cases across the country, including the populous states of California, Florida and Texas, threaten the budding recovery.
Bullard said that it is possible that the country could ""take a turn for the worse at some point in the future"", but added that it was not his base case, according to the report.
The Fed moved aggressively in March to support the U.S. economy by cutting rates to near zero, buying up trillions of dollars in bonds and launching a slate of emergency lending tools to keep credit flowing to households and businesses. 
The last of those programs was launched on Monday, which the Fed can use to buy newly minted corporate bonds.

""With all these programmes, the idea is to make sure the markets don't freeze up entirely, because that's what gets you into a financial crisis, when traders won't trade the asset at any price,"" Bullard added.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California dramatically rolled back efforts to reopen its economy on Wednesday, banning indoor restaurant dining in much of the state, closing bars and stepping up enforcement of social distancing and other measures as COVID-19 infections surge.
Indoor activities at restaurants, movie theaters, museums and other facilities will be banned in 19 counties where 70% of the population lives for at least three weeks, Governor Gavin Newsom said.
""Do your best not to mix with strangers, not to mingle with people outside your household,"" Newsom said at a press briefing.
With more Californians hospitalized and requiring intensive care than at any prior point in the pandemic, the state also moved late Wednesday to re-activate four non-hospital sites where about 300 additional patients can be treated. 
California's actions comes as anxiety over the coronavirus pandemic is rising among Americans along with an alarming acceleration of new COVID-19 cases. A Reuters/Ipsos poll Wednesday showed concern about the pandemic reaching its highest level in more than a month.
Arizona, Texas and other states are also seeing a spike in cases and hospitalizations from COVID-19, and the U.S. death toll now stands at nearly 128,000.
Under Newsom's order, all bars and brew pubs, whether indoor or out, must also close in affected counties, which include heavily populated Los Angeles and Orange counties, as well as the state capital Sacramento.
Parts of the San Francisco Bay Area are included in the rollback, but the city itself was already operating under stricter regulations that banned indoor restaurant dining and similar activities.
The state is setting up strike forces to step up enforcement of the rules, made up of regulatory agencies and the California Highway Patrol, Newsom said.
Most of the enforcement activity will be aimed at businesses owners who flout orders to wear masks, maintain social distancing, or shut down banned activities, he said. 
""We have a responsibility at the same time to go after people that are thumbing their nose, that are being particularly aggressive,"" Newsom said. 
Enforcement officials will have the power to issue citations and review the licenses of businesses that do not comply, said Mark Ghilarducci, director of the Office of Emergency Services. 
Newsom also asked counties to enforce the rules, saying the state's recently passed budget allowed him to withhold funds from those that do not comply.
Hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 have been soaring in the most populous U.S. state, starting around the Memorial Day weekend. Over the previous 24 hours, 110 people had died from the disease in California, the governor said. 

Nearly half of the available intensive care beds in the state are being used by COVID patients, and the rate at which residents are testing positive for the virus has risen to 6% over the past 14 days, up from 4.6% over the prior 14 days, Newsom said.

Leaders of the South American trade bloc will hold a virtual summit on Thursday and are expected to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic, trade deals with Canada, Singapore, South Korea and start to review adjustments to their common external tariff.
But the most pressing topic will be concluding the free trade agreement with the EU that has taken two decades to negotiate and was agreed to in principle last year.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo told his counterparts the legal bullet-proofing of a document governing the agreement was all but done, thanks to ""cooperation and flexibility"" to overcome final differences.
""I hope our coordinators can conclude the text and annexes with the European negotiators after the northern hemisphere summer"" and then it will be ready for signing, Araujo said.
On Monday, speaking in Paris to a group of French citizens proposing ways to lower greenhouse gas emissions, Macron said he agreed that France should not sign any agreements with countries that do not follow the Paris Agreement on climate change.
""I share your proposal and that is why on Mercosur, I stopped negotiations altogether,"" he said.
Last year, Macron said he would not sign any trade deal with Brazil if its president, Jair Bolsonaro, pulled out of the Paris accord, threatening to upend the EU-Mercosur negotiations.
Bolsonaro backed off but environmentalists in Europe have pressed to block the trade deal anyway, citing his government's failure to curb destruction of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest.
The election of Peronist President Alberto Fernandez in Argentina last year also cast doubts on the EU trade accord with Mercosur, the world's fourth-largest trade bloc. He has said he wanted to renegotiate parts of the proposed agreement.

Argentine Foreign Minister Felipe Solá, however, said on Wednesday that Argentina would not obstruct the advance of the agreement with the EU, even though it gave his country's farmers less market access than the Uruguay Round in 1993.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation on Wednesday that would penalize banks doing business with Chinese officials who implement a national security law that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called a ""brutal, sweeping crackdown"" on Hong Kong.
The measure passed by unanimous consent, reflecting concern in Washington over China's enactment of a security law seen as ending the autonomy that allowed the former British colony to thrive as an international financial center.
The U.S. Senate passed similar legislation last week, but under congressional rules the bill must return to the Senate and be passed there before being sent to the White House for President Donald Trump to sign into law or veto.
Earlier, Pelosi made an unusual appearance at a committee hearing on the situation in Hong Kong to say the security law marked the death of the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle.
""The law is a brutal, sweeping crackdown against the people of Hong Kong, intended to destroy the freedoms they were promised,"" Pelosi said at the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the security law was an affront to all nations and Washington would continue to implement Trump's directive to end the territory's special status.
The United States has already begun eliminating Hong Kong's special status, halting defense exports and restricting the territory's access to high technology products.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday released thousands of letters and emails from individuals, businesses and nonprofit groups this spring urging wider access to its Main Street Lending Program for Americans slammed financially during the pandemic.
The central bank announced the Main Street program in late March, offering loans to mostly medium-sized businesses with up to 15,000 employees or revenues up to $5 billion. 
It asked for public feedback and got plenty. Correspondence poured in from a diverse cross-section of Americans reeling economically and in need of funds to tide them over. The Fed incorporated some of the suggestions into the planned program, which launched in mid-June but had yet to make a loan as of last week.
There were earnest pleas to make funds available to organizations that had originally been excluded. There were also glib requests for the Fed to just send money.
""Print me out $200,000,000,000,000.00 ($200 trillion),"" wrote one correspondent whose name was withheld.
The writers included school-meal providers, the American Hospital Association, a tuxedo rental company, the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee, local YMCAs and the California State University system. Requests also came from energy providers, Dallas hotel magnate Monty Bennett, and advocates for the needs of felons.
It paints a picture of a central bank, which once closely guarded its secrets, newly open to public feedback and willing to respond by reshaping its policies. Many groups pleaded with the Fed to allow nonprofits access to the program. 
""I find the omission of nonprofits from the Main Street lending program not only unconscionable, but economically disastrous...the cost to society will be much greater in the long run than the cost to support these organizations with loans,"" Lisa Gold of the New York-based Asian American Arts Alliance wrote in an email.
Others sought reduced minimum loans and a lower bar for borrowing.
""I would encourage you to lower the minimum loan amount from $1 million to $500,000,"" Mitesh Ravel, a Subway franchise owner in Virginia, wrote in an email. ""As a small business with 65 employees and about $5 million in revenue, $1 million is more than I need or can afford to finance.""
In tweaking the program, the Fed ultimately lowered the minimum loan threshold to $250,000. It also released a proposal to allow nonprofits to borrow alongside private companies.

So far 300 lenders have signed up to participate, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this week. He also indicated the Fed was open to making further adjustments to the program.

The Senate approved the extension on Tuesday. It would keep the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which expired at midnight Tuesday, operating through Aug. 8. The bill, which both chambers passed on a voice vote, now goes to President Donald Trump for signing into law.
Lawmakers have been at odds over what additional steps are needed to help people, businesses and local governments cope with a pandemic that has sickened more than 2.6 million Americans and killed more than 127,000.
The Treasury Department and the Small Business Administration have handed out $515 billion since April under the small business lending program to help cash-strapped companies make rent and keep workers employed.
The House and Senate action is aimed at keeping the funds flowing at least a few more weeks as lawmakers discuss restructuring the program for the longer term.

Congress has signed off on roughly $3 trillion in coronavirus aid so far, but Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed policymakers have said more will be needed.

642,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 05:18PM ET</span>",China’s Central Bank Is Signaling a Slowing in Pace of Easing,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s central bank is slowing down the pace of monetary easing amid signs of economic recovery, handing disappointment to investors who have worried about tightening liquidity and rising bond yields.
Since early May, the People’s Bank of China has tolerated a steady increase in money market rates and the highest 10-year sovereign bond yield in five months. And although a fresh liquidity injection was signaled by the government two weeks ago, Governor Yi Gang is taking an unusually long time to deliver.
Instead, Yi has told markets to start thinking about an “exit” from the looser financial policies seen earlier this year, even as the country faces a highly-uncertain path out of the historic economic slump in the first quarter. For now, he’s backed by the data -- a manufacturing survey released this week points to continued improvement in both demand and supply in June.
Monetary policy is still easing in a broad sense, but there’s been some “partial tightening” compared with the stance in February and March, said Ding Shuang, chief economist for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc in Hong Kong. “The central bank supports economic recovery with eyes on faster credit growth and lower borrowing costs, but it is not to make everyone in the market happy.”
With China’s finance ministry taking the lead in economic policy support this year by issuing a record amount of special-purpose bonds, the central bank is pursuing a far more restrained strategy than global peers. Though intensifying disputes with the U.S. and the risks of a second-wave of infection may be prompting officials to save stimulus for worse scenarios ahead, Yi is also warning of the risks of prolonged monetary easing.
“We believe that the financial support policies in response to Covid-19 are phased policies,” he said in a speech in Shanghai on June 18. “We should pay attention to the “aftereffects” of the policies, keep the aggregates at appropriate levels, and consider in advance the reasonable timing of exit for the policy tools.
Monetary policy is returning to the “pre-Covid approach” of easing that features targeted stimulus, said Liu Peiqian, China economist at Natwest Markets in Singapore. “While ensuring job stability still needs relatively fast credit growth, the loosest moment in monetary policy is behind us, owing in large part to the improving economic fundamentals.”
Indeed, the economy is on track to post a small expansion this quarter, after a slump of 6.8% in the first three months. Growth in industrial output and fixed-asset investment are expected to reach a pace similar to the pre-virus level in the second half of the year, according to a recent Bloomberg survey, while retail sales and exports are still contracting.
In its latest move, the PBOC cut the cost of a lending program to lower borrowing costs for small businesses from Wednesday, signaling a continuation in the targeted easing approach.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say..
“The PBOC is still in an easing cycle, given the overall economic conditions. They are still providing liquidity via its 1.8 trillion yuan re-lending quota and 400 billion yuan loan purchase scheme, but this may be different from the market’s expectation (aggressive cuts in interest rates and RRR). In addition, we still expect the PBOC to cut rates and RRR over the course of the year, but they may want to wait to see the existing easing actions being transferred into lower funding costs for corporates.”
David Qu, Bloomberg Economics
The next step in reserve-ratio cuts had been expected earlier in June after the State Council, China’s cabinet, signaled such a move. Normally, the central bank, which is not independent, will act within days to implement the government’s wish.
One reason for policy restraint now lies in regulatory concerns over arbitrage practices, in which companies borrow cheaply from banks and invest in high-yield structured deposits, Bloomberg reported earlier.
The concern had been that some banks were expanding too fast in issuing the products, driven by corporate demand and small banks’ need to take deposits. That would roll back some of the gains in China’s long-running deleveraging campaign.
“There is no doubt that the financial arbitrage may have kept certain liquidity within the financial system, seeking speculative high returns without flowing into the real economy,”  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) economist Liu Li-gang wrote in a note. “This risk should be addressed by using the macro-prudential policies with tightened regulation. In our view, the task to help support the real economy and stabilize growth is a more urgent task.”

643,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 05:05PM ET</span>","Ukraine central bank chief abruptly resigns, citing political pressure","By Natalia Zinets and Matthias Williams (NYSE:WMB)
KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine's Central Bank Governor Yakiv Smoliy unexpectedly submitted his resignation on Wednesday, citing ""systematic political pressure"" on the bank's activities and attempts to curb its independence. 
If the resignation is accepted by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the decision could derail a $5 billion loan programme that Ukraine agreed last month with the International Monetary Fund to fight a sharp economic slump, which is conditional on the central bank staying free of political meddling.
The IMF and Zelenskiy's office did not immediately comment. 
Under Smoliy's leadership, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has kept its reputation among investors as a respected institution that brought down inflation to single digits while resisting calls for faster interest rate cuts. 
Ukraine's economy is expected to contract by around 5% this year because of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The central bank board in a separate statement said it would continue working to preserve macro-financial stability. 
The central bank has previously complained of being subjected to pressure, including over its decision in 2016 to nationalise Ukraine's largest lender, PrivatBank, which was formerly co-owned by a backer of Zelenskiy.
""I've submitted my resignation appeal to the President. This decision has been taken as an answer to systematic political pressure that denied fulfillment of my duties as the Governor,"" Smoliy wrote on Twitter. 
""Let it be a warning for attempts to undermine institutional independence of the central bank.""
Smoliy submitting his resignation came on the same day as Ukraine raised $1.75 billion in new Eurobond issuance, on the back of securing the IMF deal. It must first be accepted by Zelenskiy and then approved by parliament.

""The NBU is the most trusted institution amongst foreign institutional investors. Terrible news for Ukraine,"" said Timothy Ash at Blue Bay Asset Management. ""The future of the IMF programme must be in doubt. Who succeeds Smoliy will be critical"".

The government said in a decree that ""phase 3"" of economic reactivation, which includes 96% of production activities, will restart all mining activities, industrial sectors and commerce, though they must comply with health protocols for the pandemic.
Restaurants and shops will reopen to cater to a limited capacity of customers. Officials are also weighing health protocols for resuming domestic air and land transport. 
""The goal is to revive the economy and create jobs,"" said President Martin Vizcarra, speaking at an event to announce the purchase of 400 ventilators from China.
At least 240,000 companies received an economic stimulus from the government to help them reopen, Vizcarra said.
TV channels showed video of hundreds of people at bus stops in Lima on their way to work under new guidelines that limit the timing and frequency of when workers can travel. 
Peru lifted its quarantine in 18 of its 25 regions after coronavirus infections began to slow, though its borders remain closed. It was one of the first countries in Latin America to go into lockdown in mid-March. 

Peru had 288,477 coronavirus cases and 9,860 people had died as of Wednesday, ranking it the second highest outbreak in Latin America behind Brazil, according to a Reuters tally.

LONDON (Reuters) - One of the main bondholder alliances in Argentina's $65 billion debt talks is at risk of splintering after at least three of its members signalled they could break ranks and accept a lower value deal than the group has proposed, three bondholders said.
The bondholders, who requested anonymity, told Reuters the Argentina Creditor Committee (ACC) - one of three main creditor groups - has been jolted by U.S. funds Gramercy, Fintech and Oaktree signalling they were willing to pursue their own deals.
The ACC has proposed a deal where bondholders would effectively receive 55-56 cents for their securities, but the indications that the trio and perhaps one or two others may be prepared to accept a lower offer, has caused a rift.
""It is possible,"" one of bondholders familiar with the discussions said of the potential fracturing of the group. ""These committees are fluid and firms come and go.""
Gramercy, Fintech and Oaktree, which had joined forces with ACC earlier this year, either did not immediately respond to requests for comment or were unreachable for comment on whether they have had separate contacts with Buenos Aires.
The ACC will need to hammer out the issue over the coming days, which come at a crucial stage in talks with the Argentine government.
Negotiations have been extended a number of times in an effort to reach a deal, though the other two main creditor groups, the ""Ad Hoc"" and ""Exchange"" groups, complained this week of a lack ""meaningful engagement"" from the government since mid-June.
Those two groups, which have also forged an alliance, could potentially draw in ACC members if it did end up splintering, though some funds may also simply go their own way.
""There's a split in our committee with the majority not in favour of this backchannel deal supported by funds that have hardly any bonds,"" a second bondholder said of the ACC friction.
A third bondholder added: ""Could Gramercy and Fintech go their own way? Certainly, but hopefully we can still find a unified ACC approach.""
The first two bondholders were also critical of proposed tweaks to the government's deal that they see as an attempt to strongarm investors to sign up - rewarding those who do to the detriment of those who do not.
Between $10-$15 million a day of interest has been building up on Argentina's defaulted bonds in recent weeks, while other limited-time-only sweeteners have also been dangled, they said.
""It sets a bad precedent for other restructurings,"" the second bondholder said. ""They are trying to use these (proposals) in a coercive manner.""
The first bondholder also voiced frustration that the Argentine government had not been keener to bridge the relatively small gap in the offers.

""The frustration is that Argentina knows the contours of the deal that would get broad acceptance,"" he said. ""But they are spending valuable time and resources in trying to extract every last tidbit of value out of creditors.""

646,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 04:25PM ET</span>","Fed mulls promises for the future, appears to discount yield curve control","By Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve edged towards a longer-range plan for monetary policy at its meeting last month, raising serious questions about a strategy known as yield curve control that is untested in the United States, and signaling it may rely on explicit promises about its inflation or employment goals to steer public expectations.
Minutes from the U.S. central bank's June 9-10 meeting indicate policymakers held a lengthy debate about the critical next steps they may take in setting monetary policy for what they hope will be a continued recovery from a pandemic-driven health and economic crisis.
At the center of discussion: whether to import the sort of long-term interest rate targeting currently used by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), and what statements or ""forward guidance"" to make in the coming months about its plans for the recovery period.
While no decisions were made, policymakers appeared skeptical of yield curve control, alternately described as a ""target"" or ""cap"" in the Fed's minutes, which were released on Wednesday.
""Nearly all participants indicated they had many questions regarding the costs and benefits of such an approach,"" the minutes said. They then offered a long list of possible problems, from the Fed losing control of the size of its balance sheet to defend a rate target, to losing control of its independence if, for example, other monetary policy goals like controlling inflation clashed with the rate target.
Fed officials did appear to favor crafting some promises about the future - in effect making a pledge not to raise rates until some goal is met, with some of them favoring a focus on inflation and others on the unemployment rate.
That sort of language, many Fed officials felt, could stand on its own, ""as long as the (policy-setting) committee's forward guidance remained credible,"" and would not need to be combined with yield curve control, as is currently done by the RBA.
In a recent Reuters poll, 29 of 44 economists said they did not think the Fed would introduce yield curve control this year. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts gave slightly better than even odds the Fed might incorporate some element of yield curve control into its longer-range plans for managing the economic fallout from the novel coronavirus outbreak.
""The most likely next step"" is for the Fed to tie future rate hikes to achievement of its long-elusive 2% inflation goal, JP Morgan analyst Michael Feroli said after the release of the minutes.
COMBINATION STRATEGY
The behavior of global bond markets isn't forcing the Fed to rush. Interest rates across the spectrum are at record lows: Even if the U.S. central bank decided to target some long-term rate, it likely wouldn't set it at lower level than the rates already produced by a gloomy global economic outlook.
That is giving Fed officials time to continue studying the issue and watching how different rate-control strategies are playing out among their peers.
While much of the attention has focused on the BOJ's decision to set an interest rate on the 10-year bond, a more likely parallel for the United States is the RBA's recent move to set a 0.25% rate on the three-year government bond.
The RBA has not just specified the target for that bond, but promised to maintain it ""until progress is being made towards the Bank's goals of full employment and the inflation target.""
That sort of combination strategy - of tying explicit promises about interest rates to progress on a central bank's mandated goals - has been mentioned favorably by some officials in an ongoing review of Fed monetary policy.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard in a pair of speeches last year outlined strategies roughly similar to what the RBA adopted in March, in which interest rates were capped over perhaps a one-year or two-year horizon - with the time frame tied to how long policymakers judged it would take to see the hoped-for changes in unemployment and inflation.
But there are risks. The Fed used yield curve control during and after World War Two to hold down long-term interest rates to help finance the war effort. That required close cooperation with the U.S. Treasury, and central bankers found it hard later to break that connection and reassert enough independence to control rising inflation - a dynamic revisited at the Fed's meeting last month.
""It seems like there’s slightly less urgency (in June’s minutes) than I would have expected. And I’m glad to see some members concerned about the financial stability consequences,"" said Jon Hill, U.S. rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets.
Nonetheless, Hill said he thinks the Fed could still launch a yield curve control effort, but he believes the next few meetings are off the table to allow it to study the issue more extensively. ""It's more of a Q4 story,"" Hill said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers are looking at reviving a Great Recession-era promise to keep interest rates low until certain conditions are met, in a bid to deliver a more rapid recovery from the recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.
The policymakers ""generally indicated support"" for tying rate-setting policy to specific economic outcomes, minutes from the U.S. central bank's June 9-10 policy meeting showed on Wednesday. ""A number"" favored a promise to leave rates low until inflation meets or even modestly exceeds the Fed's 2% goal. 
A couple of policymakers preferred tying changes to rates to a specific unemployment rate; a ""few others"" wanted to promise easy monetary policy until a specific date in the future - an approach the Fed used effectively in 2012 and 2013.
Although two warned of the danger of adopting any such policy, citing financial stability risks, the minutes showed that policymakers overall supported giving the public more explicit forward guidance, both for rates and bond purchases, ""as more information about the trajectory of the economy becomes available.""
The readout showed much less support, and many questions, about alternate forms of support including control of the yield curve, a strategy in use by other central banks around the world. 
Fed officials anticipate the United States will suffer the worst economic downturn since World War Two, and they have no intent to let up on providing stimulus for the foreseeable future.
""Members noted that they expected to maintain this target range until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the (rate-setting) Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals,"" the Fed said in the minutes.
The U.S. dollar slightly extended losses against the yen and euro while the S&P 500 index edged higher after the release of the minutes.
OUTLOOK UNCERTAIN 
The Fed has repeatedly said the U.S. economic outlook remains highly uncertain and reiterated that a full economic recovery hinges on the battle to control the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 127,000 people in the United States.
Since the meeting, a surge in U.S. infections has led several policymakers to warn that signs of a nascent economic recovery over the last few weeks could already be under threat as hard-hit states halt or reverse the re-opening of their economies.
The U.S. economy slipped into recession in February and economic output and employment are still far below pre-crisis levels despite a rebound as restrictions were eased. More than 30 million people were receiving unemployment checks in the first week of June, about a fifth of the labor force.
At last month's policy meeting, the Fed signaled it planned years of extraordinary support for the economy, with policymakers projecting the economy to shrink 6.5% in 2020 and the unemployment rate to be 9.3% at the end of the year. 
In addition to slashing interest rates, the central bank has also pumped trillions of dollars into the economy to keep credit flowing to businesses and households.

Americans' anxieties over the spread of the coronavirus are at the highest level in more than a month, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed on Wednesday, a day after the United States recorded the biggest single-day rise in new cases since the pandemic began.

Germany is facing its deepest recession since World War Two and after slight changes, record new debt of up to 217.8 billion euros is planned for this year, just below the original target of 218.5 billion euros.
The difference is due to reallocation of funding rather than a reduction in the package, which includes a temporary cut in sales tax, a child bonus and help for firms and municipalities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top senator is preparing a bill to ban Chinese companies from U.S. capital markets if they engage in spying, human rights abuse or support China's military, threatening a financial blow as tensions mount over COVID-19 and Beijing's crackdown on Hong Kong. 
Republican Marco Rubio, a prominent China hardliner, said he plans to unveil the legislation in the coming weeks after the U.S. Department of Defense released a list of 20 companies that it alleges are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.
""The Chinese Communist Party's exploitation of U.S. capital markets is a clear and ongoing risk to U.S. economic and national security that must be addressed,"" Rubio said in a statement to Reuters. 
""In the coming weeks, I will be introducing legislation to ban these companies from operating in U.S. capital markets and make clear to the Communist Party that they will no longer be able to exploit our financial system,"" he added.
The bill will also target companies that support Chinese industrial policy, according to Rubio, who spearheaded successful anti-China initiatives including legislation to sanction Beijing for its repression of Uighur minorities.
The move by Rubio, acting chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, comes as relations between Washington and Beijing have soured over China's crackdown on Hong Kong via a national security law and the origins of the coronavirus, which has killed over 125,000 Americans.
On Monday, the United States began eliminating Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law, halting defense exports and restricting the territory's access to advanced technology as retaliation for the move. 
Roger Robinson, a former White House official who supports curbing Chinese access to U.S. investors, said 13 of the 20 companies designated by the Defense Department last week as Chinese-military-backed have a presence in U.S. capital markets.
""The list of PLA-affiliated Chinese enterprises released by the Pentagon is symptomatic of the broader challenge represented by Chinese companies in our capital markets from an investor protection, national security and human rights perspective,"" said Robinson, referring to the People's Liberation Army.
China hardliners in Washington have already targeted China's access to U.S. capital markets as a pressure point, succeeding in halting plans by federal pension fund administrators to allow a $40 billion fund to track an index that includes controversial Chinese companies.

In May, U.S. President Donald Trump tasked a team with studying U.S.-listed Chinese companies to better protect American investors after China's  Luckin Coffee  (OTC:LKNCY), which trades on the Nasdaq stock exchange, said employees fabricated millions in sales.

The $600-per-week payments to laid-off workers, which began at the end of March and are set to expire on July 31, would be extended until jobless rates in individual states fell below 11%.
On June 5 the U.S. unemployment rate stood at 13.3%.
Under the Democrats' legislation, these federally backed benefits would fall by $100 for every percentage-point decrease in a state’s unemployment rate, until joblessness falls below 6%.
The proposal comes as 33 million people in the United States are either receiving unemployment benefits or awaiting approval, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said. 
While many workers have been returning to their jobs after states loosened self-quarantine steps in response to the coronavirus pandemic, a significant increase in hospitalizations in several states has since caused some governors to rein in those actions.
On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said he supports continuing expanded unemployment insurance benefits during the pandemic but said the size of the $600-per-week payments have discouraged some workers from returning to their jobs.
McConnell has ignored a $3 trillion coronavirus aid bill passed by the House of Representatives in May, saying he wanted to first gauge the state of the hobbled U.S. economy before acting on a bill at the end of this month.

But even Republicans wanted to take some action sooner. Late on Tuesday, the Senate unanimously approved a Democratic bill to extend an expiring $660 billion small business emergency loan program through Aug. 8.

""If we can get the public health issues under control either through a really robust mitigation strategy or a vaccine, then we can reengage in economic activity really quickly,"" Daly told Washington Post Live in a virtual program. ""Then it could take just four years or five years; but if we end up with a pervasive long-lasting hit to the economy, then it could take longer.""
The U.S. Labor Department is set to release June's unemployment rate on Thursday, and economists expect it to have fallen to 12.3% from 13.3% in May as more of the world's largest economy reopened.
During the Great Recession the nation's monthly unemployment rate never exceeded 10%, and in February 2020, before widespread shutdowns of economic activity to slow the spread of the virus, it was 3.5%.
A rapid in rise in infections in California, Arizona, Texas and Florida has in recent weeks driven the nation's tally of new cases to a daily average of 40,000, and the governors in those states have taken some steps to reimpose limits on economic activity to restrain the spread.
Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, told lawmakers Tuesday that if current trends continue the country could see 100,000 new cases a day.
Daly said so far it is ""too early to tell"" whether her best-case scenario will play out, or something worse.

“If we can get the public health issues under control either through a really robust mitigation strategy or a vaccine, then we can reengage in economic activity really quickly,” Daly said Wednesday in a virtual Washington Post Live event. “Then it could take just four years or five years. But if we end up with a pervasive, long lasting hit to the economy, then it could take longer.”
The U.S. economy officially entered a recession in February, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, ending a decade-long recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. Although some of the early heavy-hit areas of the country are now seeing lower rates of the coronavirus, states like Texas and California are witnessing a resurgence after starting to reopen their economies.
Not V-Shaped
Some data indicate that the economy is starting to recover. Retail sales jumped 17.7% in May from the previous month and a gauge of manufacturing rose to the highest level in more than a year. Daly said this doesn’t mean the country will see a “V-shaped” recovery.
“We’ve certainly seen some signs that are positive,” Daly said. “But I would hesitate to call this a recovery. Because ultimately the virus will determine the pace at which we can go.”
She added that the Fed learned a lot from the previous expansion, when the unemployment rate fell to a 50-year low even while inflation remained subdued. The tight labor market caused employers to hire Americans that are often left on the sidelines, such as disabled workers and the formerly incarcerated.
“What we heard time and time again is that the economy is hotter than we think it could be,” Daly said, referring to the Fed Listens events that she and her colleagues attended in communities throughout the country. “If unemployment has fallen to historically low levels as opposed to hovering around its pre-recession trend, then this causes employers to rethink the skills they require, to do more on-the-job training.”

Merkel, a Christian Democrat who had long resisted quotas, said she is talking to Family Minister Franziska Giffey, who proposed legislation on the issue in February, but saw the topic sidelined during the coronavirus lockdown.
""It is absolutely inadequate that there are still listed companies with not a single woman sitting on the board,"" Merkel told parliament, noting that companies had found enough female candidates for their supervisory boards to meet the quota.
Merkel said it could take time for her coalition government to reach an agreement on the subject, but suggested she hoped it would happen before next year's parliamentary election, when she has said she will not run for another term.
While women made up 28% of the supervisory boards of Germany's top companies in 2018, they only accounted for 10% of executive positions. 
Jennifer Morgan became the first woman CEO of a German blue-chip company last year, as co-leader of business software group SAP, but she stepped down in April, leaving Christian Klein as the company's sole CEO.
Giffey, from Merkel's Social Democrat coalition partners, has proposed that executive boards of about 70 listed companies should include at least one woman if the top team is made up of three people or more.
Giffey also wants to extend the 30% quota for supervisory boards to around 600 private companies from about 100 now, hoping that the new rule should take effect next May.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - As accelerating poverty fuels anger, despair and fear of a social explosion, efforts by Lebanon's ruling elite to salvage the country from a financial meltdown with IMF help seem to be going in reverse.
A country known across the Middle East for its glamorous lifestyle and commercial savoir faire now projects images of people begging on the streets, scavenging in the garbage for something to eat or trading furniture for food.
Several current and former Lebanese officials, diplomats, international officials, economists and analysts agreed that talks with the IMF to rescue Lebanon from an economic crisis are going nowhere. Meanwhile, time is running out.
“This (IMF talks) is hitting the rocks” says Nasser Saidi, a former economy minister and central banker.
Most of the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity say the political class grouped around sectarian, dynastic rulers, far from agreeing a joint approach, is still arguing for their own interests – and even whether Lebanon is really bankrupt.
Two members of Lebanon's negotiating team have quit in a month, both over what they described as attempts to massage huge financial losses set out in the government plan. 
“They are not negotiating a (IMF) programme”, says one senior source privy to the talks. “There’s no (Lebanese) consensus on the diagnosis so what can they possibly negotiate?”
Lebanon, with a population of 6 million, is fast running out of dollars. The state, its revenues collapsing, is printing local currency to pay public employees – an estimated 800,000-strong state payroll padded by politicians.
""There is a real risk of explosion,"" says one top Western diplomat, adding that a third of a million people had lost their jobs since October, when mass protests against the entrenched political class forced the government to resign.
DEADLOCK OVER NUMBERS AND REFORM
As a lockdown imposed to fight COVID-19 unwinds, outrage that fuelled last autumn's protests is resurging, angrier now and with fire-bomb attacks on banks – the biggest target of popular ire after the political elites with which they are closely entwined.
A new government finally took its place early this year. Although it was billed as technocratic, its members are all nominees of the sectarian power-brokers.
Alongside technocrats are party placemen, and critics say Prime Minister Hassan Diab is beholden to his patrons, foremost among them the powerful Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah, its Christian allies headed by President Michel Aoun, and the Shi'ite Amal party of Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.
Diab has repeatedly denied his government favours political interests. His office did not respond to questions from Reuters.
Ultimately, the country is bankrupt, and is not going to be able to service all of its vast debt, much of which is held by its central bank and local lenders. But no one has come up with an agreed strategy to share out the losses among bank depositors, shareholders, foreign bondholders and the state.
The first challenge is accepting the size of the losses. The IMF has endorsed government figures that suggest a shortfall of more than $90 billion. But the banks, the central bank and members of parliament representing powerful political factions say it is only around half as big. Critics call that an accounting trick, based on a dubious exchange rate.
Diab, the prime minister, said in a statement on Tuesday that the government was committed to the figures in its plan. But political factions have lined up behind an effort to demand it lower its estimate of losses, in line with figures put forward by the central bank and banks.
Several sources said the IMF had tried to persuade the central bank to accept the higher numbers, but bank governor Riad Salameh was digging in his heels. Salameh declined to comment and said he wasn't aware of such criticism.
A parliamentary fact-finding committee said on Wednesday it had calculated overall losses in the system at 60 trillion-122 trillion Lebanese pounds, a range between a quarter and half the amount recognised by the government and accepted by the IMF.
""It's a big difference,"" said its chair, Ibrahim Kanaan of President Michel Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement, flanked by MPs from all of the other main political parties. ""These are the options which I hope the government will study ... so we can go into the next phase, the negotiation phase, with one delegation and one vision.""
The IMF declined to comment on its discussions with Lebanese delegations, but referred Reuters to earlier remarks, including that the government's original figures are ""broadly in the right order of magnitude"".
“It is incredible that a bunch of parliamentarians in a failed state are trying to question the expertise of the IMF,"" Saidi, the ex-minister, said. ""There is no way the IMF is going to accept it.”
Nor will accepting the numbers be enough. Lebanon must also tackle the cause of the problem: unsustainable government spending handed out by politicians to reward their supporters.
The inflated public payroll and its costly pensions will have to be cut. First on almost everyone’s list is Electricite du Liban (EdL), the state power utility, which loses about $2bn a year. 
To even start an IMF negotiation, the government will need to make ""anchor"" reforms that it has so far ignored. Customs, now under party fiefdom, must be placed under regulatory authority; a single treasury account must be set up for expenditures and revenues at the finance ministry; exchange rates must be unified.
NOT RISING TO THE CRISIS
Since October, depositors have been largely denied access to their dollar accounts. About three quarters of all deposits are in dollars and the central bank and successive governments have used the banking system to finance the state, in what critics say is a national equivalent to a Ponzi scheme.
The pound has lost 80% of its value since mass protests against the sectarian ruling oligarchy erupted last October. The social consequences have been terrible.
Lebanon’s middle class is sinking. The World Bank estimated in 2019 that some 48% of Lebanese lived below the poverty line.
Food prices have doubled and unemployment has forced many onto charity and food banks. And if the state runs out of the dollars it has been spending to subsidise bread, medicine and fuel – as it must sooner or later without foreign aid – Lebanon could face mass hunger.
For decades, foreign donors led by France, the United States and Britain with periodic injections from Gulf Arab states, have kept Lebanon afloat. But they are no longer willing to bail it out without reform. If the IMF walks away, Beirut should not expect a rescue from countries that have helped in the past.
“If this road (IMF) is closed all other roads will be shut”, says the Western diplomat. “They need to have real, verifiable reforms as required by the IMF, even if they are not perfect.""

""No European or Gulf Arab country, much less America is coming to save Lebanon; Lebanese leaders should muster the will to rescue their country.""

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and Mexico's Consejo Coordinator Empresarial said in a joint statement that the new U.S.-Mexico Canada Agreement provides certainty for business investment in the region.
The replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) launches under a cloud of disputes, with the United States considering new tariffs on Canadian aluminum and growing concerns over Mexico's ability to meet new labor standards in the deal..
""Overall, the agreement increases our region´s competitiveness, which is vital in an uncertain international context characterized by protectionist temptations,"" the groups said in a statement. ""Nevertheless, the agreement was less than hoped for in areas such as intellectual property, procurement, and labor mobility.""
The groups said that North America's largest industry, automotive, will have difficulty complying with new, tighter regional content rules for vehicles and parts.
""New rules in a number of other areas, such as labor, will also present compliance challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic and economic downturn may make adapting to these new rules even more challenging,"" the groups said.
They added that governments should refrain from the use of tariffs on national security grounds, a comment aimed at the Trump administration as it considers reimposing a 10% duty on Canadian aluminum to halt a ""surge"" in imports across the northern border that began after a tariff exemption was granted last year.
Steel industry groups also said the trade deal's requirement that 70% of the steel used in regional auto production be North American-made would boost and demand strengthen the regional supply chain. 

""Our steel producers are prepared to supply the steel their auto and other customers need to meet the new regional value content requirements of the USMCA,"" said Kevin Dempsey, interim president of the American Iron and Steel Institute.

662,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>",ECB's Lane signals policy pause as markets stabilize,"By Balazs Koranyi, Francesco Canepa and Frank Siebelt
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane signalled a pause in policy action, arguing that a rebound is underway, markets have stabilized but that many months will be needed before there is clarity over the shape of the recovery.
Facing the biggest European recession in living memory due to the coronavirus pandemic, the ECB has already increased stimulus three times this year, providing unprecedented support for an economy that could shrink by close to a tenth in 2020 and take another two years just to get back to its pre-crisis level.
The ECB extended its emergency bond purchases until June 2021 and Lane said that while markets are already pricing in a further expansion of the scheme, the bank had given itself up to a year to reassess the situation. 
""We’ve done a lot. We have essentially this one-year horizon,"" Lane, a Dublin-born former university processor, told Reuters in an interview this week. ""That one-year horizon reflects that, before we really know how able the European economy will be to recover from this shock."" 
Lane added that the ECB's intervention, including 1 trillion euros worth of loans to banks at negative rates and substantial purchases of commercial paper, had stabilised markets since March while banks remained ""very liquid"". 
Although recent economic indicators from industry surveys to inflation data have exceeded forecasts and positive data could come for a ""long time"", Lane sought to temper expectations, arguing that a good bounce now says little about the broader recovery, which is likely to be interrupted from time to time. 
WINTER SCENARIO UNCLEAR
""We’re in for a long period where the data should be mostly positive...(but) these weeks of the initial bounce don’t really provide a guide to what’s going to happen in the winter."" 
Lane's comments are in contrast to the views of Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane, who said robust early data argued for a rapid, V-shaped recovery and reduced downside risks.
Lane, the architect of the ECB's crisis-fighting measures, also appeared to play down expectations that the ECB will soon include sub-investment grade corporate bonds in its asset purchase programme, a topic discussed heavily among market analysts in the early phase of the crisis.
Few companies have lost their investment grade rating and, with the initial pandemic-related crunch over and many government guarantees put in place, Lane does not anticipate an imminent wave of downgrades. 
""To me, current ratings look like a reasonable balance. The data are not compelling to say there should be a lot more downgrades.""
Although some are expecting euro zone inflation to turn negative in the coming months on increasing slack and crashing oil prices, Lane said his base case was for very low but positive readings on the back of fiscal and monetary expansion. 
The ECB targets inflation at just under 2% in the medium-term but has missed this for seven consecutive years, despite record stimulus. Some argue that surging debt levels will make it impossible for the ECB to tighten policy in the future as any rise in borrowing costs would raise debt sustainability concerns in places like Italy - and threaten the euro itself.
Lane dismissed such arguments, saying this is not ""unconditional truth"" and high debt on its own does not prevent a rise in inflation, which is a key condition for the ECB to wind down stimulus. 
""Our forward guidance is full of exit strategies. But what is true is the only real way to prove this is through action.""
Lane further said the ECB does not target any particular spread levels between the yield of euro zone members, and it is ""absolutely not"" into yield targeting.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Global tourism revenues are expected to fall by up to $3.3 trillion due to COVID-19 restrictions, with the United States standing to lose the most, according to a U.N. study published on Wednesday.
The 'COVID-19 and Tourism' report released by The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) is based on three scenarios for the industry, with lockdown measures lasting 4 months, 8 months and 12 months.
In those scenarios, revenues would fall $1.17 trillion, $2.22 trillion and $3.3 trillion respectively or between 1.5-4.2 percent of the world's gross domestic product (GDP).
The report did not say which scenario was most likely, although an UNCTAD official said the middle scenario ""could be a realistic one"".
""International tourism has been almost totally suspended, and domestic tourism curtailed by lockdown conditions imposed in many countries,"" the report said.
""Although some destinations have started slowly to open up, many are afraid of international travel or cannot afford it due to the economic crisis.""
The United States incurs the highest losses in all three scenarios, with a $187 billion drop in the one lasting just four months, followed by China with $105 billion. Thailand and France also stand to lose approximately $47 billion each.
Small island states such as Jamaica stand to suffer big losses in proportion to their economies, facing an 11 percent fall in GDP or $1.68 billion. 
The U.S. loss in the ""pessimistic"" scenario is $538 billion, or three percent of GDP.
The UNCTAD report covers 65 individual countries and regions. It calls for governments to boost social protection for affected workers in badly-hit nations.

Some of the estimates are comparable to those in a previous U.N. report by its World Tourism Organization in May, which found that tourism numbers could fall by 60-80 percent compared with 66 percent in UNCTAD's intermediate scenario.

""Congress cannot afford to let this moment pass,"" Joshua Bolten, the president and chief executive of The Business Roundtable group, said in a statement on Wednesday.
""There is room for bipartisan agreement on many critical issues of policing reform, but the issues will be resolved only in negotiations between the House and Senate,"" the statement added.
The development comes amid demonstrations against police brutality following the May 25 death of George Floyd, a Black man killed after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes while detaining him in Minneapolis.
The group urged Congress to bring about more transparency and accountability in the reforms including establishing a 'National Police Misconduct Registry' to maintain disciplinary records of police officers.
It also called for federal minimum standards for policing, including on use of lethal and non-lethal force, adding that training programs for the police should be made more robust.
""There is no question that businesses can – and should – play a role in addressing the systemic inequities that Black Americans as well as other people of color face when it comes to policing in our nation today,"" said Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon, who is the chairman of Business Roundtable.

666,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 08:10AM ET</span>",Argentina's hard-won fiscal progress knocked back by virus,"By Hernan Nessi
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina battled last year to trim its fiscal deficit, but its progress has been crippled by the coronavirus pandemic as emergency spending has ballooned while tax revenues flatlined.
The South American grains producer, which is renegotiating $65 billion debt and has been locked out of capital markets after a default in May, had shrunk the deficit last year with tough monetary tightening to trim back a heavy debt load.
That tightening has now gone by the wayside to firefight the impact of COVID-19, with money taps opened to counteract a tanking economy pushing millions into poverty.
Argentina posted a fiscal deficit in May of around $3.7 billion, the deepest on record. The deficit could swell to 5.5%-6.5% of gross domestic product for the full year, analysts polled by Reuters said, from around 2.2%-2.5% so far this year.
""The pandemic and quarantine have hammered the fiscal accounts, which were already in a fragile situation before the coronavirus outbreak,"" said Isaias Marini, economist at consulting firm Econviews.
""Primary spending soared in the last three months, while income plummeted in line with a downturn in economic activity.""
The left-leaning government of President Albert Fernandez has rolled out assistance packages to low-income workers and families while freezing utilities tariffs to help people hit by the lockdown. Primary spending almost doubled in May to 579.5 billion pesos ($8.23 billion).
Despite 45% annual inflation, tax receipts have stalled during the lockdown, which has been extended and tightened in the densely-populated area in and around capital city Buenos Aires.
""The fiscal deficit increased and now we are in a situation that is way more delicate than the situation before COVID-19,"" Economy Minister Martin Guzman said during an event in June.
The economy has tanked during the pandemic. Economic activity in April plummeted 26.4% and the International Monetary Fund has forecast a nearly 10% economic contraction for the full year. It would be Argentina's third straight year in recession.
FISCAL GAINS ""ERODED""
The country, under the former administration of Mauricio Macri, had slowly improved its fiscal position with tight policies to rein in spending, in part to meet targets agreed with creditors like the IMF.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said that with high spending to battle the virus ""fiscal consolidation efforts of the past couple of years are being quickly eroded"" even as Argentina races to restructure $65 billion in foreign debt.
""Amid lack of market access, Argentina should incur in further deficit monetization to fund the widening fiscal gap, in turn helping fuel inflation once domestic demand conditions begin to normalize,"" the investment bank said in a note.
Local consultancy ACM, which predicts a fiscal deficit exceeding 6% for the year, said the outlook would worsen with tumbling tax revenue and ""higher costs to help firms and workers in quarantine mitigate the spread of the coronavirus"".
Analysts said that even after Argentina strikes a debt deal and the pandemic ends, the country will still need to climb an economic mountain, including tempering runaway prices once demand rebounds given recent injections of cash.
Month-on-month inflation has come down recently as the lockdown has hit consumer spending.
""The main thing now is to renegotiate the debt, so you can go back into debt to finance the expansionary fiscal policy,"" said Natalia Motyl, an economist at policy think tank Libertad y Progreso, adding the government eventually may have to raise tax revenue and cut pension payments.
""Argentina during this crisis does not have much room to maneuver. But come what way, once this crisis is over, there needs to be a comprehensive economic plan.""

PARIS (Reuters) - The United States remains committed to global talks on the taxation of big digital companies despite its call for a pause, the head of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said on Wednesday.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's suggestion last month that a break was needed sparked European concerns about Washington's commitment to a deal on the first major rewriting of cross-border tax rules in a generation.
Comments by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer that Washington was ""no longer involved in the negotiations"" further fanned those doubts.
""To be clear, contrary to some earlier media reports, the U.S. has not pulled out of the negotiations,"" OECD Angel Gurria said in a speech to delegates meeting online for the latest round of talks among nearly 140 countries.
""Indeed, the presence of the U.S. delegation here today, notwithstanding the U.S. request for a delay on pillar one, confirms their ongoing engagement in this important work.""
Pillar one refers to the talks to update international tax rules for the digital era, where big companies like Facebook (O:FB) and Alphabet's Google (O:GOOGL) can legally book profits in low-tax countries regardless of where their end-clients are.
Those talks are running in parallel to a second pillar of negotiations to agree a global minimum level of corporate taxation, which are more advanced and - unlike the digital talks - have a fair chance of being wrapped up this year. 
""Pillar two will ensure that a minimum level of tax will be paid, no matter how much clever tax planning is undertaken by multinationals,"" Gurria said.

""This is why we need to reach an international agreement, whether partly in October and then later in 2021, or any other possible combination driven by the political agenda,"" he added.

Investing.com -- Texas and California post new record highs for Covid-19 infections, as Anthony Fauci warns that the U.S. is losing control of the virus. Europe's economy shows signs of further improvement, while China makes its first arrests in Hong Kong under the new national security law. Stocks are set to open lower ahead of the ISM Manufacturing Index later, while oil prices are regaining momentum after fresh signs of falling output and recovering demand. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 1st July.
1. California, Texas post new infection records
Texas reported a record-high 6,900 new coronavirus cases Tuesday, while California reported a new record high of 8,441, according to Reuters. The numbers amplify the warning on Tuesday from the U.S.’s top doctor Anthony Fauci that the country is losing control of the epidemic.
Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that the U.S. “is going in the wrong direction” and warned that new infections could top 100,000 a day. His words came ahead of the July 4th weekend, on which public events and family gatherings are set to pose heightened risks of transmission.
Fauci said around half of all new cases are currently coming from four states: California, Texas, Florida and Arizona.
A poll for CNBC showed that the virus’ progress was increasingly feeding through into negative ratings for President Donald Trump less than five months ahead of November’s election.
2. Europe improves at jobless surge eases
Europe’s economy showed further signs of improvement after its collapse earlier in the second quarter.
The composite IHS Markit purchasing managers index for the euro zone June was revised up to 47.4, while the index for the U.K. rose above the 50 level, suggesting that the economy has stopped contracting. The Bank of England’s chief economist Andrew Haldane, who had voted against increasing the bank’s bond-buying last month, also said the U.K. rebound is proceeding faster than expected.
In addition, the rise in German unemployment slowed sharply in June to only 69,000, well below expectations for a 120,000 rise. French auto registrations rose in year-on-year terms for the first time this year.
3. Stocks set to open lower; ISM eyed
U.S. stocks are set to start the third quarter on a negative note, as concerns about the spread of the virus – and a possible further chill in relations with China – dominate sentiment.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 161 points, or 0.6%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 0.5% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 0.3%.
The unease about risk assets is being reflected in the price of Gold, which advanced to a new eight-year high after closing above $1,800 for the first time since 2012 on Tuesday. By 6:30, it was at $1,805.65 a troy ounce, up 0.3% from Tuesday’s close.
Stocks in focus will include Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), brewer of the world’s most unfortunately-branded beer, and  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS), both of whom report earnings. The day's big data release is the ISM Manufacturing Index at 10 AM, which is expected to rise from 43.1 in May to 49.5 in June.  There's also the ADP private payrolls report for June.
4. China cracks down in Hong Kong
Chinese police made their first arrests in Hong Kong under the new security law, which was enacted on Tuesday.
The law, which provides for life sentences against those convicted of subversion, sedition and terrorism, was imposed without being read in the city’s own legislature.
CNN reported around 70 arrests in response to protests that were relatively small by comparison with earlier pro-democracy actions before the coronavirus pandemic exploded.
5 Oil rebounds on rebalancing evidence
Crude oil prices regained some upward momentum after data showing a clear drop in exports in June from Iraq, the biggest over-producer in the OPEC+ bloc.
By 6:30 AM, U.S. crude prices were up 2.4% at $40.22 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent was up 2.2% at $42.33 a barrel.
The mood was also helped by a much larger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude stocks – as reported by the American Petroleum Institute – which reassured traders that the process of market rebalancing hasn’t yet been derailed by the surge in U.S. Covid-19 cases.
The extent of the rebalancing was further illustrated on Tuesday – albeit with numbers that were largely of historical interest - as the Energy Information Administration said U.S. oil output had fallen in April to 12.06 million barrels a day, over 300,000 b/d more than it had previously estimated.
The government’s own inventory data for last week are due at 10:30 AM ET."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan's new board member Toyoaki Nakamura said on Wednesday the central bank must ""respond early"" to downside risks that could emerge from the coronavirus pandemic.
In his inaugural news conference, Nakamura also said Japan would not see inflation pick up sustainably unless economic conditions allowed for the central bank to abandon negative interest rates.
""Looking at Japan's current economy, we can say it's in a pretty severe situation,"" Nakamura said. ""It's important to respond early to economic developments, with an eye on conditions regarding the coronavirus pandemic,"" he said.
A former executive at electronics giant Hitachi (T:6501), Nakamura joined the BOJ's nine-member board on Wednesday, succeeding former auto executive Yukitoshi Funo.
Japan is mired in recession as the pandemic hit exports and consumption, forcing the BOJ to ditch its efforts to achieve its elusive 2% inflation target for now and focus on supporting the economy.
Nakamura said with demand ""evaporating,"" it was not the right time to consider abandoning negative interest rates.
But he said Japan was forced to adopt negative rates because aggressive money printing by the BOJ failed to boost demand.
""Unless Japan returns to a situation where we can abandon negative rates, it won't see (sustained) inflation,"" he said, signalling that the BOJ should eventually seek to pull rates out of negative territory.
The BOJ loosened monetary policy in March and April focusing on steps to ease funding strains for companies hit by slumping sales from the pandemic.

The central bank has held off on deepening negative rates from the current -0.1% or cutting its 0% long-term rate target, partly on concerns over eroding financial institutions' margins.

675,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 06:09AM ET</span>",You’ll Need a Decoder Ring to Figure Out the U.S. Jobs Numbers,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s no way around it: Thursday’s U.S. labor reports will be a mess.
While the June jobs data and weekly unemployment claims are expected to show further improvement in a hammered market, the actual trend may not be immediately clear when the Labor Department issues the reports at 8:30 a.m. in Washington. What’s more, the numbers could again be the subject of confusion and debate in the hours and days that follow.
That’s because some of the figures have been beset by data-quality issues, particularly the misclassification of out-of-work Americans as employed. The problem has caused the official unemployment rate to understate the degree of joblessness in America during the pandemic, and a fix would make comparisons between May and June difficult -- an especially sticky situation if the rate rises solely because unemployed people are finally classified correctly.
Understanding the numbers is more than just an exercise for economists, who blew it last time with projections of 7.5 million job losses in May, before the government reported a gain of 2.5 million.
The potential end of applications for small-business aid risks spurring a new wave of layoffs in the coming months, and the extra $600 a week in federal unemployment benefits is set to end in late July. President Donald Trump’s reelection bid increasingly hinges on the economy -- his main advantage over Democratic challenger Joe Biden in polls.
Meanwhile, the nascent recovery -- from a recession that began in February -- is under a growing threat from a surging coronavirus that’s causing cities and states to pause reopenings of restaurants and other businesses.
“We’ve got big forces at work here,” said James Sweeney, chief economist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG. In addition to the return of workers and the misclassification, “more recently you have the new wave of infections slowing the return. So this is tricky.”

The monthly report -- released a day earlier than usual because of the Independence Day holiday -- is forecast to show employers added 3.1 million workers to payrolls in June, a second month of record gains, while the jobless rate is expected to drop to 12.5% from 13.3%. That’s still well above the half-century low of 3.5% from February.
Similarly, the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits in state programs likely fell for a 13th straight week, to 1.35 million, economists estimated. Even so, that’s six times as high as before the pandemic.
Misclassified Workers
The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles and publishes the national employment report, has struggled to overcome data-collection issues. Millions of workers are estimated to have been misclassified as employed but absent from their jobs due to “other reasons” rather than being counted as unemployed on temporary layoff.
The BLS has since taken additional steps to help survey-takers classify workers correctly, but solving this problem may create another: If the unemployed are counted properly, it could very well result in an increase in the official rate from the previous month -- even if the reality is that joblessness fell in June.
There are several moving parts for the unemployment rate, said Lydia Boussour, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “We do think that this month we will see a bit of a stronger correction in that misclassification issue, so we are expecting to see a multi-million drop in the number of employed but not at work.”
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“The unemployment rate is projected to have declined in June, though problems correctly classifying some workers introduces significant uncertainty.”
-- Yelena Shulyatyeva, Andrew Husby and Eliza Winger
While labor-market improvement in June could very well be real, American jobs face fresh threats in coming months.
The Paycheck Protection Program, a nearly $700 billion federal fund for companies to rehire workers and pay other expenses, was slated to close for applications on June 30, though lawmakers were attempting late Tuesday to extend the deadline. Many small firms are already mulling cuts to payrolls as their funds wind down, or wondering what happens when their cash runs out and sales are still down.
Rehiring, Cutting
One such owner is Lenore Estrada, co-founder of Three Babes Bakeshop in San Francisco. The caterer and seller of organic, seasonal pies rehired 11 of its 26 workers thanks to an initial infusion of PPP funds but anticipates needing to cut expenses without another lifeline by September.
“The economic model that you were basing your business on previously just doesn’t work anymore,” she said. “It’s going to be a long road to recovery.”
The funding is already insufficient for some firms. About one in five companies that received PPP funds terminated at least one employee in May and June, and half rehired those workers in that period, according to data from payroll and human-resources firm Gusto.
Even though policy makers tweaked the PPP program in June, including extending the time for companies to use their funds through the end of the year, “it may not be enough,” said Daniel Sternberg, head of data science at Gusto, which works with about 100,000 small businesses.
Meanwhile, economic activity in Texas, Arizona, and Florida has flat-lined or even started to decline from an earlier period of improvement, as virus cases and hospitalizations jumped in recent weeks, according to a Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysis of Homebase and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) data.
And that could mean more uncertainty for next month’s report.

In a guide published on Wednesday, the ECB clarified that merged entities won't necessarily be asked for extra capital and will be allowed to use their own accounting models as well as any ""badwill"" - a paper profit that occurs when an asset is bought below its book value.
These were some of the concerns flagged by bankers in recent years when evaluating mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the euro zone.
The ECB stressed, however, that it was not its job to orchestrate deals and these needed to be driven by the market.
""Our prudential mandate is not to assess whether consolidation efforts are beneficial,"" ECB supervisor Édouard Fernandez-Bollo said in a blog post presenting the guide.
""But well-designed and well-executed consolidation can help address the overcapacity and low profitability problems that have been damaging the European banking sector since the last financial crisis,"" he added.

The guide will now be open for consultation until Oct 1.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog will not open a formal inquiry into how banks charge for overdrafts, but put them on notice on Wednesday of a full evaluation of their pricing next year.
The Financial Conduct Authority gave banks just two weeks in January to explain changes to their overdraft rates which would leave around eight million consumers worse off, or face action.
HSBC, RBS (LON:RBS), Nationwide and Santander (MC:SAN) were among the lenders to have announced plans to charge customers a flat rate of nearly 40% for overdrafts, which was more than double some of their previous charges, ahead of new rules in April.
""We have analyzed the strategic, competitive and financial drivers of banks' overdraft pricing decisions based on their responses,"" the FCA said in a statement on Wednesday.
""Having reviewed the evidence we obtained we do not intend to open a formal investigation at this stage.""
The rule changes were designed to fix a “dysfunctional” overdraft market, banning lenders from imposing fixed daily or monthly fees and from charging more for unauthorised overdrafts than for authorised overdrafts. 
Most banks estimate that pricing changes would reduce their total overdraft revenue by between a quarter and a third, or more than half a billion pounds across them all, the FCA said.
But overdraft charges were still higher than other mainstream borrowing like credit cards and personal loans.
""Despite banks increasing headline interest rates, the cost of borrowing will go down or remain unchanged for most people,"" the watchdog said.
""We will be keeping a close watch on how prices develop, particularly during and after the coronavirus pandemic.""
Banks will for the first time have to publish in August quarterly information on their overdraft pricing and this will be scrutinised by the FCA.

It will also make a full evaluation of overdraft rules starting after April 2021.

LONDON (Reuters) - Consumers in difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic will have more time to ask for a temporary freeze on their credit card payments, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said on Wednesday.
Measures introduced in April to offer temporary relief to customers with credit cards and interest-free bank overdrafts were due to end this month.
The FCA said that customers yet to request a payment freeze or an arranged interest-free overdraft of up to 500 pounds, will have until Oct. 31 to apply.
""For those who are now in a position to restart payments, it will be in their best interests to do so. But for those who still need it, the package we are confirming today ensures there is help and further support,"" said Christopher Woolard, the FCA's interim chief executive.
Firms should contact customers coming to the end of a first payment freeze to find out if they can resume payments - and if so, agree a plan on how the missed payments could be repaid, the watchdog said.
The FCA also said on Wednesday that temporary curbs on how banks charge for overdrafts during the pandemic would not be extended.
""Firms that do choose to increase their charges from this temporary level should give customers impacted by coronavirus an opportunity to seek extra support before any changes take effect,"" the FCA said.
Wednesday's statement does not apply to other forms of consumer credit including motor finance, payday loans, pawnbroking, rent-to-own and buy-now pay-later products whose COVID-19 related measures will be updated soon, the FCA said.

WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY/OTTAWA (Reuters) - The revamped trade pact between the United States, Canada and Mexico taking effect on Wednesday was meant to create a kind of fortress North America, boosting the region's competitiveness - but cracks are already starting to show in the foundation.
As the deal kicks in, the Trump administration is threatening Canada with new aluminum tariffs, and a prominent Mexican labor activist has been jailed, underscoring concerns about crucial labor reforms in the replacement for the 26-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. The risk of disputes among the three trading partners is growing, analysts say.
The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement includes tighter North American content rules for autos, new protections for intellectual property, prohibitions against currency manipulation and new rules on digital commerce that did not exist when NAFTA launched in 1994, an agreement U.S. President Donald Trump has lambasted as the ""worst trade deal ever made.""
The coronavirus has all three countries mired in a deep recession, cutting their April goods trade flows - normally about $1.2 trillion annually - to the lowest monthly level in a decade.
""The champagne isn't quite as fizzy as we might have expected - even under the best of circumstances - and there's trouble coming from all sides,"" said Mary Lovely, a Syracuse University economics professor and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ""This could be a trade agreement that quickly ends up in dispute and higher trade barriers.""
Issues dogging USMCA include hundreds of legal challenges to Mexico's new labor law championed by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to ensure that workers can freely organize and unions are granted full collective bargaining rights.
A ruling against it would harm Mexico's ability to deliver on provisions aimed at ending labor contracts agreed without worker consent that are stacked in favor of companies and have kept wages chronically low in Mexico.Democrats in the U.S. Congress had insisted on the stronger labor provisions last year before granting approval, prompting a substantial renegotiation of terms first agreed in October 2018. The arrest of Mexican labor lawyer Susana Prieto in early June has fueled U.S. unions' arguments that Mexican workers' rights are not being sufficiently protected.
""I remain very concerned that Mexico is falling short of its commitments to implement the legislative reforms that are the foundation in Mexico for effectively protecting labor rights,"" U.S. Representative Richard Neal, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said on Tuesday, adding that USMCA's success ""truly hinges"" on its new labor enforcement mechanism.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has said he will file dispute cases ""early and often"" to enforce USMCA provisions, citing Mexico's failure to approve U.S. biotech products..
That could lead to increased tariffs on offending goods, such as products from individual factories where labor violations are found.
Carlos Vejar, a former Mexican trade negotiator, said it was in the country's interest to uphold pledges made to strengthen unions and end child labor.
""If Mexico isn't mindful of this, there will be cases against Mexico, and Mexico will lose them,"" Vejar said.

ALUMINUM TARIFFS REDUX, AUTOMOTIVE BURDENS
U.S. national security tariffs on imported steel and aluminum - including from Canada and Mexico - were a major irritant during USMCA negotiations until a deal for exemptions was reached last year. But now, USTR is considering domestic producers' request https://aluminumnow.org/apaa-calls-on-ambassador-lighthizer-to-restore-tariffs-on-surging-canadian-aluminum-imports to restore the 10% duty on Canadian aluminum to combat a ""surge"" of imports across the northern border. 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday told reporters that these would hurt both countries and raise materials costs for U.S. manufacturers.
Another source of disputes could be the energy sector, where the main U.S. oil and gas lobby has already complained that recent actions by Mexico favoring state oil company Pemex violate protections for private investors carried over from NAFTA. 
Canada has also complained about new Mexican rules formally threatening investment in renewable energy. 
USMCA will put new compliance burdens on the region's automotive manufacturers as the coronavirus craters consumer spending and auto production. Within three to five years, vehicles' minimum North American content rises to 75% from 62.5%. Automakers must also produce 40% of their vehicles' content in ""high wage"" areas - effectively the United States and Canada.

683,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 12:42AM ET</span>","New York City passes budget with police cuts, but some say it's not enough","By Jonathan Allen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York City Council voted to pass the 2021 budget on Tuesday with cuts to police funding after weeks of fraught negotiations with Mayor Bill de Blasio, but some lawmakers complained it fell short of a $1 billion cut they and protesters demanded.
The austere, coronavirus-era budget tightens spending across city agencies, including a cut of nearly $484 million from the New York Police Department's $6 billion operating budget if the department can adhere to new overtime limits, the council said. 
Another $354 million of police funding will be transferred to other city agencies, most prominently in the mayor's agreeing to shift oversight of school safety officers from the NYPD to the Department of Education, the council said.
After many hours of delays, a majority of 26 lawmakers voted via teleconference to pass the budget, although voting continued as the midnight deadline passed, with at least 13 voting against it. Outside an empty City Hall, more than 1,000 protesters demanding the shrinking of a police department they decry as violent and racist continued a week-old encampment.
City Council Speaker Corey Johnson disputed de Blasio's characterization that $1 billion was being ""shifted away"" from the NYPD budget, saying the mayor and some council members refused to agree to a police hiring freeze.
""I know that there are many who are disappointed,"" he said before the vote. ""I am disappointed as well. I wanted us to go deeper."" 
He nonetheless urged members to pass the budget: ""Today's budget agreement is one of necessity,"" he said.
The budget negotiations were shaped by two crises that have shaken the city. 
The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 23,000 city residents and created a $9 billion shortfall in revenue, leading to deep cuts across city agencies, with the mayor warning he may have to lay off 22,000 municipal workers.
And a month of nationwide protests against police violence gave new political heft to calls to defund police departments, forcing de Blasio to shift from his original April proposal of cutting NYPD funding by less than 1% while slashing youth services. 
In May, George Floyd, a Black man, was killed when a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck while arresting him on suspicion of spending a fake $20 bill, sparking one of the largest protest movements seen in the country in decades.
""It's time to do the work of reform, to think deeply about where our police have to be in the future,"" de Blasio told reporters earlier on Tuesday. 
""Are there going to be critics on all sides? Of course. But I'm convinced this is real change."" 
He has opposed reducing the number of officers patrolling the city, saying he fears it would lead to rising crime.
The cuts include the cancellation of the July enrollment of what would have been more than 1,100 new recruits, though another class will be enrolled in October. 
The City Council said the budget included an effort to reduce overtime pay by $352 million, although previous efforts to cap NYPD overtime have failed.
The mayor said he would also restore some summer youth programs he had originally canceled.
Communities United for Police Reform, a coalition of 200 community groups that originally called for a $1 billion cut to the NYPD's budget and have criticized police officers patrolling public schools, said their demands were still not being met.

""Mayor de Blasio and Speaker Johnson are using funny math and budget tricks to try to mislead New Yorkers,"" Anthonine Pierre, a spokesperson for the coalition, said in a statement. ""Moving police from the NYPD to other agencies does nothing to reduce police violence.""

684,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 12:36AM ET</span>",Europe’s Move to Keep Americans Out Signals Long Travel Slump,"(Bloomberg) -- As the Eiffel Tower gradually reopens from an extended shutdown, an essential segment of the summer tourist trade will be missing: Americans touching down in Paris on lucrative trans-Atlantic flights.
Voyagers from New York, Houston or Los Angeles will have to hold off on their overseas vacations after European Union governments extended a travel ban from Wednesday, deeming the U.S. response to Covid-19 insufficient to allow its citizens to enter the bloc for non-essential reasons.
The decree, which will be reassessed every two weeks, signals the restrictions holding down business and leisure travel across the Atlantic will remain in place until the spread of the deadly virus is curtailed in the U.S.
In contrast, the EU loosened rules for residents of countries including Australia, Canada, Japan and New Zealand, partly easing the paralysis that seized up travel when the pandemic first took hold. But the ruling on the U.S. highlights the challenges facing airlines and hotels as they try to plan for a rebound.
“Now we know that this will be a prolonged crisis without any return to normal for a very long time,” Alain Battisti, president of France’s aviation group Federation National de l’Aviation Marchande, said in an interview. “The European decision certainly won’t translate into a strong turnaround. Instead, it’ll be timid and very gradual.”
Tourist Trade
France was the world’s most-visited international tourist destination in 2018, one of six European countries among the top 10, based on data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization. The U.S. was third, helping to explain why routes over the North Atlantic are the most profitable segment of the airline industry.
That trade was hit hard after governments across the globe imposed lockdowns on public life and limited travel in an effort to tame the health crisis. Yet as the spread of the virus slows in Europe, including in former outbreak hotspots like Italy, France and Spain, cases continue to climb in parts of the U.S.
“We were obviously disappointed in the EU’s decision not to include the United States,” said Nicholas Calio, chief executive of Airlines for America, the trade group for U.S. carriers. “I’d refer to it as a work in progress and we’re hopeful that decision will be reviewed soon, and at least on a limited basis international travel between the U.S. and EU will resume.”
Virus, Protests
Meanwhile, as the Eiffel Tower prepares to reopen its elevators to tourists from other locales on Wednesday, demand from Europeans to travel to the U.S. has completely dried up, according to Battisti. He cites health fears as well as a wave of recent protests over police violence.
While the European decision could lead to a boost on some long-haul routes to other countries, demand is expected to remain largely within the region, and mostly around the Mediterranean this summer, he said. The French regional carrier Chalair Aviation, which Battisti heads, has seen rising sales to destinations like Corsica.
Business travel is also being hurt. Almost 40% more business- and first-class seats were sold on North Atlantic flights than the nearest contender last year, according to figures from OAG Aviation Worldwide.
“It’s a nightmare from an airline point of view,” said John Strickland, director of JLS Consulting in London, who has held senior positions at BA and KLM. “It’s a mammoth task for airlines to plan their routes based on what they think demand will be.”
Even with demand at normal levels, summer revenues are what decide whether or not a carrier survives through the winter, Strickland said. For airlines with large cash reserves, a bad summer will mean they have to cut jobs and retire planes, while for weaker carriers “it’ll push them over the edge.”
Border Loopholes
The EU judgement, which is non-binding on member states, recommends that visitors only be allowed into the bloc from countries where the average number of infections per 100,000 inhabitants over the past two weeks is similar to or below the level of the EU, and that the trend of new cases is declining.
While border controls are a national competence of individual governments, the document commits member states to coordinate their approach and not lift the ban for countries outside the list.
A harmonized border policy is crucial for the EU since once a traveler enters the so-called Schengen area, they can theoretically move between member countries without passport checks. And if nations start to think that their neighbors aren’t adhering to the EU guidelines, then they could reimpose internal borders, effectively bringing the free movement of people to a standstill.
Still, there are loopholes: Denmark and Ireland have opted out of the common border policy, meaning they aren’t bound by the decision. The U.K. has imposed its own rules on quarantine and Hungary will exempt U.S. film crews from the ban so they can continue shooting in the eastern European country.
Moreover, U.S. citizens with residence permits in EU countries, as well as students, medical professionals and diplomats, are still allowed in. Europeans already in the U.S. can return home at any time, and vice versa.
Customer Confusion
In a bid to navigate the complicated regulatory environment, airlines have put the onus on customers to ensure they have proper travel documents and are eligible to enter their destinations. Uncertainty about the changing nature of the rules is likely to dissuade people from booking holidays, according to Battisti.
“There is huge confusion in the minds of travelers and that’s not helping,” he said, pointing to slight variations even on travel to France’s overseas islands and territories. “We could be entering a long period of subdued demand for air travel of any kind.”

685,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 12:31AM ET</span>","Mnuchin sees support for crisis loans to hotels, restaurants","By Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Dunsmuir and Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Up to $140 billion in loans for small business could be refocused to support restaurants, hotels and other industries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday.
Those funds, authorized under the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program, are due to expire on Tuesday, when the Small Business Administration stops taking applications for the forgivable loans.
But Mnuchin said it appeared there was support among Democrats and Republicans to ""repurpose"" the money, perhaps by tailoring it to hotels, restaurants and other businesses most impacted by the social-distancing measures adopted to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
Mnuchin was testifying along with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee about the U.S. fiscal and monetary response to the coronavirus crisis, including the nearly $3 trillion allocated by Congress to help businesses and individuals.
That response is reaching a critical point, with programs like PPP and enhanced unemployment benefits expiring in July - and perhaps depriving the economy of hundreds of billions of dollars in spending - even as coronavirus infections surge and tens of millions of Americans remain out of work.
""I see a brick wall at the end of July,"" said Ed Perlmutter, a Democrat from Colorado, adding that local and state governments also face big budget shortfalls caused by lost tax revenue that could force them to lay off millions unless they get new funding.
Mnuchin said he is committed to continuing conversations on the topic with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle next month. He referred several times during the hearing to a ""next"" CARES act.
MASKS ON
The hearing took place against the backdrop of a surge in cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus. Infections more than doubled in at least 10 U.S. states, including Texas and Florida, in June, a Reuters tally showed.
The government's top infectious disease control expert, Anthony Fauci said earlier Tuesday he was very concerned that the country is going ""in the wrong direction."" 
In prepared testimony released on Monday, Powell noted that the economic recovery had begun sooner than expected, but that output and employment are still far below pre-crisis levels, with the brunt of the pain borne by women and minorities. 
A full recovery, he reiterated, is unlikely until people feel safe going out and about. 
Asked what could happen in a renewed outbreak of the virus, Powell was blunt: it ""could force governments and force people to withdraw again from economic activity, and I think the worst part of it would be to undermine public confidence, which is what we need to get back to lots of kinds of economic activity that involve crowds,"" Powell told lawmakers. 
As if to underscore the importance of simple acts like wearing masks - which public health officials widely agree reduce the spread of the virus - Powell kept his mask on throughout the session, as did most of the lawmakers. 
Mnuchin took his mask off to speak. 
Numerous Fed policymakers, including Powell, have said that more fiscal and monetary help will likely be required to keep what is expected to be a slow and uneven economic recovery on track.
The Fed has come under fire for a perception that it has prioritized Wall Street over Main Street, helping to fuel economic inequality by boosting the price of assets like stocks.
The central bank has bought trillions of dollars of bonds, and rolled out nearly a dozen programs to backstop and extend corporate credit and promote bank lending, arguing that the economy as a whole is helped when companies maintain access to the financing critical to their operations.
Data on Sunday showed the Fed bought $428 million in bonds of individual companies through mid-June, making investments in household names like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and AT&T Inc as well as in major oil firms, tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM), and a utility subsidiary of billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) holding company.

At the same time, its newly launched Main Street Lending Program has yet to make a loan and has taken three months to come to fruition. Powell said Tuesday that some 300 banks have registered for the program so far, and have told him they expect increased use ""in the next few months."" The central bank's programs overall have so far seen modest use.

The central bank mopped up $30 billion of dollars in the April-June period, the most in more than a decade, leading to a flood of rupees in the financial system. Data from the RBI suggest that local banks are recycling the liquidity into government bonds.
The impact from RBI’s foreign-exchange intervention explains why sovereign bonds have gained for a fifth month despite the deluge of issuances. That has also allowed the central bank to be circumspect about its own purchases to support the market, which traders have been demanding.
“The central bank’s FX policy is achieving multiple objectives of augmenting reserves, creating liquidity that’s helping demand for bonds, and at the same time curbing rupee volatility,” said Naveen Singh, head of fixed-income trading at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership. “The RBI may continue with its policy of injecting funds via FX interventions over open-market debt purchases for now.”
Lenders increased their holdings of sovereign debt by 13% to 41.5 trillion rupees ($550 billion) as of June 5, from the end of March, according to the latest RBI data. That comes as the banking system is awashed with surplus liquidity of 5.8 trillion rupees, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
To be sure, the RBI’s 115 basis points of rate cuts this year, and other measures to ease a coronavirus-induced credit crunch, have also contributed to the funds sitting in banks.
The RBI’s forex intervention “has kept the rupee and bonds stable, and at the same time helped clear the humongous supply of bonds,” said Saurabh Bhatia, head of fixed income at DSP Investment Managers Pvt. in Mumbai.
The yield on the 6.45% 2029 bonds, the most-traded benchmark debt, fell two basis points to 5.99% on Tuesday. It dropped 15 basis points in the second quarter even after the government ramped up its borrowings by 54% in May.

The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives must also approve the extension, which would keep the Paycheck Protection Program operating through August 8.
The measure passed unanimously in the Republican-controlled Senate, where lawmakers have been at odds over what additional steps are needed to help people, businesses and local governments cope with a pandemic that has sickened more than 2.6 million Americans and killed more than 127,000.

A toxic relationship between some city police departments and their communities was highlighted by the May death of Floyd, an unarmed Black man who died after a white Minneapolis police office pressed his neck into the pavement. 
But Congress has been unable to reach a bipartisan agreement on how to respond to demands for change in recent weeks, making it unlikely in months to come. As such, nationwide protests under the umbrella of the burgeoning Black Lives Matter movement are unlikely to end anytime soon.
""It was kind of shocking, the huge gap between where your congressional Democrats are, where a lot of people in the movement on the ground are and where Republicans appear to be, and I think that's really disappointing,"" said Ames Grawert, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, a liberal-leaning group, speaking of police reform legislation. 
""They're farther apart than ever,"" said Randy Petersen, a former police officer and now senior researcher at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative group.
BITTER REALITY 
On June 25, Democrats in the House of Representatives passed a police reform bill that Republicans have said they are unlikely to support. A day earlier, Democrats in the Senate blocked the Republicans' reform bill. Both sides have accused the other of acting in bad faith.
The breakdown is especially bitter to members of the Brennan Center, the Texas foundation, and other deep-pocketed groups who helped push through a sweeping prison sentencing reform bill https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-prisons/congress-approves-criminal-justice-bill-backed-by-trump-idUSKCN1OJ2J3?fbclid=IwAR0aWgXbg0wAP0drVxzpt8mevZTmmNTilrx1dr2DJ8hJW28t4QWkRcfbvbo in late 2018, heralded as the most significant change to sentencing in at least a decade.
The First Step Act led to the release of thousands https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-justice-prison/courts-approved-more-than-2400-reduced-sentences-under-new-law-justice-department-idUSKBN1ZE2YX of inmates. 
Supporters included Republican President Donald Trump, White House adviser Jared Kushner, billionaire libertarian Charles Koch, celebrity couple Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West, police unions, faith groups and Democratic Senator Cory Booker. 
The unusual coalition was no accident, lobbyists and activists who worked behind the scenes say. 
They pushed for years to make sentencing reform and police restructuring appear above politics, appealing to religious leaders' belief in redemption, small government advocates' belief in budget cuts and civil rights groups' concern about racial inequity.
""If you have law enforcement and the faith community on the right and then you have civil rights and social justice organizations on the left that has proven to be a strong and muscular coalition,"" said Ralph Reed, a Republican strategist and founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, which endorsed the 2018 bill.
Republicans claim Democrats, in a position to potentially take control of the Senate and the White House in the November elections, want to avoid giving the president a police reform bill he can sign or a victory he can tout. 
Democrats ""have decided that it is more politically expedient to align themselves with the angry mob rather than uphold their primary responsibility to protect the American public,"" said Republican Senator Ted Cruz in a statement.
Democrats and civil rights groups including the NAACP say they opposed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-congress/senate-police-reform-vote-fails-as-democrats-reject-republican-bill-idUSKBN23V1G2 the Republican bill because it relies on incentives to effect reforms and seeks data collection on issues such as no-knock warrants, rather than mandating changes as the Democratic bill does. 
It also failed to scale back ""qualified immunity,"" which shields https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-police-immunity-scotus/#:~:text=A%20lower%20court%20had%20granted,mostly%20to%20favor%20the%20police police from excessive force lawsuits. 
Senator Kamala Harris, who is on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's shortlist for possible running mates, called Republicans' efforts a ""political trap"" and ""crumbs on the table."" 
Reformers say they are still working with both parties behind the scenes to broker a deal. But with little more than 100 weekdays to the election, and Congress out of session for much of the summer, the window of opportunity is closing. 

""If we can't get people in our communities to believe there is justice, and that they can be protected by law enforcement, nothing else is going to matter in our society,"" said Mark Holden, a consultant for Koch Industries.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - California regulators sued Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO) on Tuesday, accusing it of discriminating against an Indian-American employee and allowing him to be harassed by two managers because he was from a lower Indian caste than them.
U.S. employment law does not specifically bar caste-based discrimination, but California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing contends in the lawsuit that India's lingering caste system is based on protected classes such as religion. 
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in San Jose, does not name the alleged victim. It states he has been a principal engineer at Cisco's San Jose headquarters since October 2015 and that he was raised at the bottom of India's caste hierarchy as a Dalit, once called ""untouchables."" 
That caste hierarchy was enforced in the workplace, according to the lawsuit, which accuses the two former engineering managers of harassment.
Cisco said it did not have immediate comment, saying that it planned to issue a statement at a later time.
Like other large Silicon Valley employers, Cisco's workforce includes thousands of Indian immigrants, most of whom were brought up as Brahmins or other high castes.
The civil rights group Equality Labs in a 2018 report cited in the lawsuit found that 67% of Dalits surveyed felt treated unfairly at their U.S. workplaces.
Some employers have begun taking action. Massachusetts-based Brandeis University last year added caste to its nondiscrimination policy in what is believed to be a landmark move in U.S. higher education.
At Cisco, the unnamed employee reported his manager to human resources in November 2016 for outing his caste to colleagues. The manager allegedly retaliated, but Cisco determined caste discrimination was not illegal and issues continued through 2018, the lawsuit states.

Cisco reassigned the employee's duties and isolated him from colleagues, rejected a raise and opportunities that would have led to one and denied him two promotions, according to the lawsuit.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Automakers and their suppliers may be able to escape penalties for compliance infractions for up to a year under a new North American trade deal that takes effect on Wednesday, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official said on Tuesday.
The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement requires that for tariff-free access, vehicles must contain 75% North American content by value, up from 62.5% under the 26-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, which it replaces. The USMCA also requires that 40% to 45% of a vehicle's value come from ""high wage"" areas, namely the United States and Canada.
The percentages are determined differently than under NAFTA, requiring companies to change how they certify compliance, and there are new mandates to use North American-made steel and aluminum.
Brenda Smith, CBP's executive assistant commissioner for trade, told reporters on a conference call that automakers would have until the end of 2020 to fully certify that their current production and future production plans can comply with the new rules under a three-year or five-year phase-in period.
But for the first six months of 2021, she said the agency will apply an ""informed compliance period"" during which it will advise companies on how to correct compliance errors, rather than imposing punitive duties on products of companies actively trying to comply.
""Our expectation is that they are meeting the rules but recognize that a certain amount of flexibility is warranted during a transition period. We are not in the role of playing 'gotcha,'"" Smith said.
The compliance grace period was first revealed to automotive suppliers last week, said Ann Wilson, a senior vice president with the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association. She told Reuters that USMCA compliance would be hard on smaller suppliers already facing liquidity issues because of the coronavirus.
""We are pleased that we’ve got a little bit more time to come up with a compliance document, but it’s not going to be without challenges,"" she said.

The British Chamber of Commerce said on Wednesday its quarterly survey of 7,700 firms found the share of companies reporting growth in sales was far below even the low point of the global financial crisis of 2007-08.
""Our results demonstrate the need for swift and substantial action,"" the BCC's director general Adam Marshall said. ""The UK cannot meander its way back to success in this era of uncertainty."" 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised on Tuesday to fast-track infrastructure investment and slash property planning rules. The spending announcement of 5 billion pounds ($6.2 billion) amounted to around 5% of gross public sector investment last year, most of which had already been announced.
Sunak is due to announce more details of the government's plans next week, on top of the 133 billion pounds of emergency measures he has rushed out mostly to keep people in their jobs. 
However, Sunak has so far opted not to bring forward a major budget statement which is due in the autumn.
The BCC said its survey showed orders and investment intentions at record lows for services firms and manufacturers. 
Marshall called on the government to cut employers' social security contributions and take other measures to help companies keep workers on their books after Britain's huge state furlough scheme expires at the end of October.

Companies would need extra investment incentives and help to survive cashflow crunches in the form of wider relief from property taxes and more grants. The government should also take measures to stimulate consumer demand, Marshall said.

Commercial insurance market Lloyd's has said insurers worldwide will pay out more than $100 billion in coronavirus-related claims this year.
But many firms are frustrated that their business interruption policies do not cover the pandemic and some in Europe and the United States are in dispute with insurers.
The Black Swan cover could be used to ensure payments after catastrophes such as a cyber attack or solar storm destroying critical infrastructure, as well as for pandemics, Lloyd's said in a report published on Wednesday.
""Our concern is you solve for pandemic and you don't solve for the next disaster,"" Lloyd's Chief Executive John Neal told Reuters.
Insurers in Britain, France, Germany and the United States are seeking government-backed ""Pandemic Re"" cover for future pandemics, similar to existing pooled insurance schemes for damage due to terror attacks.
Neal said that unlike a Pandemic Re, a Black Swan Re would help firms after ""multiple systemic exposures"". European risk managers have also called for a broader programme.
Lloyd's, which has set up a 15 million pound ($18.5 million) seed fund to create new products, is also proposing a government-backed after-the-event product to give small businesses a quick cash injection after a crisis. 
And the market is working on a new business interruption policy for its small business customers, to insure sums of up to 100,000 pounds, which Neal said could launch this year.
Britain's markets watchdog is taking eight insurers to court, including two Lloyd's syndicates, to clarify whether some business interruption policy wordings should trigger pay-outs.
Customer opinions of insurance have deteriorated as a result of the disputes, the Lloyd's report found. 

The proposals were made in conjunction with Lloyd's' global advisory committee, which includes major insurers such as Allianz (DE:ALVG) and AXA (PA:AXAF).

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday signed a decree to extend emergency stipends to informal workers hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis, as official figures showed record deficits and mounting unemployment.
The decree keeps alive a popular and crucial program for millions of the country's poorest and most vulnerable people, but which has added to the concerns of policymakers and financial markets about the surging government deficit.
The monthly stipend of 600 reais ($110), previously set to expire this month, has provided a lifeline to struggling Brazilians and a bump to Bolsonaro's popularity among the poorer voters he has traditionally struggled with.
However, presidential advisers including Economy Minister Paulo Guedes have warned that emergency spending cannot stretch on indefinitely, noting that the national debt that may soon exceed gross domestic product.
Figures on Tuesday showed that public debt rose to a record 81.9% of GDP and the public deficit hit a monthly record 131.4 billion reais in May as crisis-fighting expenditure rose and tax revenues slumped.
Guedes said debt could ultimately top 100% of GDP and the annual deficit exceed 15% of GDP. 
""That doesn't matter. What matters is next year,"" and a return to austerity and fiscal adjustment, Guedes told lawmakers on Tuesday in a virtual public congressional hearing.
Aides to Guedes have proposed that a total additional stipend of 1,200 reais could be paid in three installments of 500, 400 and 300 reais, while some lawmakers have argued that the emergency aid should be extended until the end of this year.
The presidential decree signed by Bolsonaro comprises two monthly payments of 600 reais, said Rodrigo Maia, speaker of the lower house of Congress.
The government has not yet released an official schedule. 
The extension came after labor market figures showed a rise in the unemployment rate to a two-year high of 12.9%, a record number of people leaving the workforce and a record fall in the number of people with work. Less than half of Brazil's working-age population has a formal job.

This all comes as authorities begin to ease social distancing restrictions despite alarming growth in Brazil's novel coronavirus outbreak. The country has the second worst outbreak in the world behind the United States, with 1.4 million confirmed cases and nearly 60,000 related deaths.

Japan's Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and British trade minister Liz Truss agreed last month on a swift deal on an economic partnership to secure business continuity.
Britain's relationship with the EU is in a status-quo transition period until the end of this year.
Meanwhile, Tokyo wants to conclude trade talks with Britain by the end of July as Japan needs any agreement to go through legal checks before submitting it to parliament, which is expected to be held this autumn.
""It is our highest priority to achieve an agreement within the time frame... We need to adjust ambitions to a realistic level,"" Hiroshi Matsuura, who is chief negotiator for trade talks with Britain told Reuters on Tuesday.
He said negotiations would be based on the EU-Japan trade pact and Japan is seeking a higher commitment if possible, adding that digital trade would be an area where both countries could agree on a higher level of deal.
The issue of automobiles is among Japan's major interests. 
""The auto industry is an important industry for Japan, we want to seek higher level of trade deal,"" Matsuura said.
""We want at least the same level of tariff condition on autos with Britain as we have under the trade pact with the EU,"" Matsuura said.

The International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) governing council agreed to change the baseline year used for calculating emissions under the global CORSIA deal to 2019, the agency said in a statement.
Airlines, hit with a European-led backlash over pollution from flights, have pledged to spend billions of dollars under CORSIA to cap their emissions at 2020 levels through the purchase of carbon offsets.
Under CORSIA, which starts in 2021, airlines would buy carbon offset credits to cover any emissions from international flights above the current baseline of average emissions in 2019 and 2020.
But because emissions from international flights this year are set to drop significantly due to the sharp reduction in air travel as a result of pandemic, IATA asked that the baseline be changed exclusively to 2019, before the pandemic hit aviation.
ICAO said it would have created an ""inappropriate economic burden to aeroplane operators, due to the need to offset more emissions although they are flying less and generating less emissions.""
Environmentalists opposed efforts to change the baseline to 2019, arguing it would allow airlines to pollute freely for years.
The European Union's 27 member states backed IATA's request, while two sources said the United States also supported the changes. China, Russia and India had argued they wanted more time to study the changes, the sources said.
CORSIA was launched following approval from most of ICAO's member countries at the agency's assembly in 2016.

699,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 04:45PM ET</span>",U.S. Treasury Unemployment Payouts Surpass $100 Billion in June,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Treasury Department has paid out more than $100 billion in unemployment benefits in June, the most for a single month since the pandemic started and underscoring the importance of federal relief efforts to shore up a battered job market.
With just one day left to be reported, the U.S. Treasury paid out $108.5 billion in unemployment benefits in June, according to its latest daily statement published Tuesday. That exceeded the $93.6 billion in May and $48.4 billion in April as the department continues to play catch up with the backlog in processing claims due to an overwhelming number of people applying for benefits.
States have said that claims from as early as the start of February are finally making their way through the system. And with the average weekly claim amounting to a little less than $1,000 -- which includes a temporary $600 pandemic benefit -- backdated checks could amount to thousands of dollars.
Despite the surge in payments in June, the numbers still fall short of the estimated $141.2 billion that should have been paid during the month, according to Bloomberg calculations based on weekly unemployment filings and the average size of those claims. The total estimated shortfall since March, when pandemic-related job losses began, now comes to about $105.3 billion, according to Bloomberg calculations.
While the labor market has started to improve, the recovery has been gradual. In the week ended June 13, 19.5 million Americans were still collecting state unemployment benefits, meaning that Treasury payments could continue to surge in the coming months.
“High-frequency data are already pointing to a slowdown in employment in late-June amid rising coronavirus infections nationwide,” Lydia Boussour, a senior economist at Oxford Economics, said in a note. “And a federal government failure to aid state and local government and avoid income cliffs over the summer would further jeopardize the recovery.”
Early in the pandemic, Congress approved a measure that added $600 to weekly unemployment claims, a benefit that is set to expire on July 31 and could reduce the Treasury’s growing bill. But if the benefit is extended, as has been proposed by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, payouts could continue to climb into August and beyond.
If that’s the case, federal spending on unemployment relief could surpass the more than $500 billion spent on small business rescue under the Paycheck Protection Program, which is currently the biggest piece in the $2.2 trillion fiscal rescue package passed in March.

The 2020-21 deficit could still reach C$5 billion if the economic downturn is prolonged or infections accelerate, Premier Brian Pallister said.
Manitoba, whose economy is based on manufacturing, farming and mining, has had low daily case counts of coronavirus infections compared with most provinces. Much of the province of 1.4 million people is sparsely populated outside of its capital Winnipeg, which accounts for about half the population.
Its economy has largely reopened after lockdowns.
""What's changed is Manitobans have responded arguably better than citizens anywhere else in the world,"" Pallister said, referring to public safety measures. ""We've earned the right to be optimistic now.""
The province has 18 active coronavirus cases.
Pallister said he would not consider raising the provincial sales tax to narrow the deficit.

(Reuters) - Policymakers need to keep diversity and structural racial inequalities in mind when analyzing the labor market and other measures of the economy, two Federal Reserve officials said on Tuesday. 
The standard metric used for evaluating U.S. unemployment is flawed because it does not capture the experiences of different groups, and officials should be open minded about how they evaluate full employment, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said during a virtual forum on race and economic mobility. 
""It's clear that the headline unemployment is deeply flawed as a measure. It does not count so many people who are not in the workforce who may want a job,"" said Kashkari. 
Fed officials have become more vocal about the ways different groups are faring in the economy and the focus on racial inequities is here to stay, even if the U.S. central bank is not able to target specific groups in its policies, said Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank president Raphael Bostic. 
""I think what you’re looking at is a new Fed on some level,"" said Bostic. ""We're going to make sure our institutions don't sort of slink away as things move forward.""
The two Fed officials have been among the most vocal policymakers calling attention to racism and inequality in recent months. Bostic, the Fed's lone Black bank president, penned a letter earlier this month calling for an end to racism and laying out the ways the Fed could help to reduce racial inequalities. Kashkari leads the Fed district in the city where George Floyd died in police custody, setting off a wave of protests across the country and kicking off a national conversation about racism. 

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has also commented frequently about how Black and Hispanic workers were among the last to feel the benefits of the tight labor market, and were then hit disproportionately by the job losses caused by the pandemic.

703,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 03:56PM ET</span>",Mexican labor activist's arrest sends 'wrong signal' under North America trade deal,"By Daina Beth Solomon
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - As the new North America trade deal takes effect on Wednesday, the jailing of Mexican labor lawyer and independent union leader Susana Prieto has reignited concern about the challenges of meeting its labor rights provisions.
The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) was signed last December after a flurry of final negotiations over demands from U.S. Democratic lawmakers for stricter enforcement of Mexico's labor standards.
As part of the deal replacing NAFTA, as the old free trade pact was known, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to uphold worker rights.
In the country where workers have historically earned much less and have had weaker protections than their U.S. counterparts, Lopez Obrador has touted a 2019 labor reform meant to make it easier for workers to form independent unions.
But with that reform still several years from full implementation, Prieto's case has cast fresh doubt on the government's ability to make good on the promise, underscoring Mexico's long-running challenge of carrying out federal directives at the local level.
Any serious violation of labor provisions in the USMCA, including the assurance that Mexicans will enjoy real collective bargaining rights, could jeopardize the pact governing one of the world's largest trading blocs. 
Prieto rose to prominence last year leading a series of raucous protests and strikes for better pay at manufacturing plants in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, on the border with Texas. Most recently she showed up at border factories in a white hazmat suit, urging workers to demand a shutdown during the coronavirus pandemic and full pay for everyone furloughed. 
The Tamaulipas state prosecutor charged Prieto after her arrest in early June with committing crimes against public servants, including threats and inciting a riot. She has denied the charges. 
In an interview, Mexico's Labor Minister Luisa Alcalde joined calls for Prieto's provisional release while the case proceeds and recognized that meeting USMCA's requirements could be tricky. 
""This implies a major challenge, since there could be matters where the reform still isn't implemented, and yet, there are complaints over rights violations, above all about union freedoms and collective bargaining,"" she said.
Lopez Obrador has warned against fabricated charges and retaliation in Prieto's case, but said the matter was in the hands of Tamaulipas authorities. 
Asked about Prieto's detention at a recent congressional hearing in Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer called it ""a bad indicator."" He said labor attaches and panels formed under the deal would swiftly call out any labor violations. 
U.S. Democratic Representative Bill Pascrell urged the Trump administration to push for Prieto's release in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday, saying her arrest ""sends the wrong signal that the renegotiated NAFTA is not on track to deliver the improved Mexican labor conditions."" 
'UNPROTECTED'
The Tamaulipas state attorney general has said about 400 workers organized by Prieto were violent and threatened government workers in a protest outside the Matamoros labor board last March. 
The workers had gathered en masse to demand that union fees no longer be withheld from their pay at Tridonex, a unit of U.S. auto parts firm Cardone Industries, Inc, part of a bid to cut ties with their current union and seek better representation.
Cardone Industries declined to comment. 
Prieto had stopped by for about 10 minutes and left without interacting with labor board officials, Prieto's spokeswoman Alyn Alvidrez said. 
A statement from the Tamaulipas labor ministry at the time said it would process the Tridonex workers' request. It made no reference to any aggressive acts by the protesters and the labor board's president, Jose Manuel Gomez Porchini, declined to comment. 
When she was arrested, Prieto had also been trying to win a collective bargaining agreement for a new union at Michigan-based auto parts maker Fisher Dynamics' factory in Matamoros.
Prieto told Reuters earlier this year that her National Independent Union of Industry and Service Workers (SNITIS) was already representing Fisher workers. But she said state authorities had stalled in scheduling a vote in which workers could elect SNITIS to administer the contract. 
Fisher did not respond to requests for comment.
Under Mexico's labor reform, which took effect in May 2019, a centralized judicial entity is due to begin taking over from state labor boards in October, partially in an effort to lessen delays.
Prieto has not accused Fisher or Tridonex of orchestrating the charges against her. The Tamaulipas labor ministry said it could not comment on a criminal case. 
In addition to 1,300 SNITIS members at Fisher, a majority of workers at five other factories have shown support for joining the union since its founding last year, and Prieto represents workers in about 4,000 labor disputes, Alvidrez said.

""All of them right now are unprotected,"" she said at a protest last week in Mexico City, as supporters chanted, ""Free Susana!""

The ministry, said it sees the coronavirus crisis cutting the fiscal surplus by 1.7 billion levs ($977.80 million) on an annual basis through June. It expects to end the year with a fiscal deficit of 3% of GDP. 
So far the country has recorded a budget surplus of 1.3 billion levs, or 1.1% of GDP, in the first five months of the year, it said.
Government revenues were 17.6 billion levs at the end of May, down 1.1 billion levs from the same period in 2019. Spending was 16.3 billion levs, up from 15.7 billion a year ago, mainly due to an increase in public pensions and other social spending, the finance ministry said.
Fiscal reserves, held under a currency regime pegging the lev to the euro, stood at 10.2 billion levs at the end of May.

The details were included in a governmental bill presented for ratification to the lower house of parliament, or the Duma. It was unclear what would happen to the agreement between Russia and Venezuela if the Duma rejects the bill.
Caracas has to pay Moscow $133 million a year from 2019 to 2022. That increases to $684 million from 2023 to 2026, the document on the lower house of parliament's website showed.
The deal, signed by Russia and Venezuela in 2018, envisages repayment of $3.12 billion in principle and interest payments of $217 million.
Russia and Venezuela agreed on the debt restructuring in late 2017. Close ally Moscow has acted as a lender of last resort for Caracas, with the Russian government and oil giant Rosneft (MM:ROSN) providing at least $17 billion in loans and credit lines since 2006.

(Reuters) - The U.S. economy is showing signs of a turnaround as businesses reopen, but the pace of the recovery is being slowed by large-scale virus outbreaks in some states and it could be years before the economy is back at full strength, New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) said on Tuesday. 
Increases in consumer spending and in building permits suggest that economic activity is improving in some areas and that the ""low point"" of the downturn may have passed, Williams said. 
""People have been getting back to work and the unemployment rate has started to edge down,"" Williams said according to remarks prepared for a virtual event focused on central banking during the pandemic. ""Although this improvement is welcome, the economy is still far from healthy and a full recovery will likely take years to achieve."" 
The Fed moved aggressively in March to support the U.S. economy by cutting rates to near zero, buying up trillions of dollars in bonds and launching a slate of emergency lending tools to keep credit flowing to households and businesses. The last of those programs, which the Fed can use to buy newly minted corporate bonds, launched on Monday.
During a moderated discussion on Tuesday, Williams said low use of the Fed's facilities is a sign of success because it suggests markets are functioning well. 
Asked about other tools the Fed could incorporate to set monetary policy, Williams repeated his view that negative rates are not a good fit for the U.S. economy. He said he views yield curve control as a tool that could complement forward guidance, but said Fed officials have not made any decisions. 
Williams cautioned that the large-scale outbreaks happening in some states could slow the pace of the economic recovery. 

""This is a valuable reminder that the economy's fate is inextricably linked to the path of the virus,"" he said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The outlook for the global labour market in the second half of 2020 is ""highly uncertain"" and the forecast recovery will not be enough for employment to return to pre-pandemic levels this year, the International Labour Organization said on Tuesday.
In its latest report, the U.N. agency said the fall in global working hours was ""significantly worse than previously estimated"" in the first half of the year. The Americas was the hardest-hit region, losing 18.3% of working hours. 
Worldwide, an estimated 14% of working hours were lost in the second quarter, equivalent to 400 million full-time jobs, due to the pandemic, the ILO said. 
It estimated that working-hour losses were likely to still be in the order of 4.9 per cent in the fourth quarter, equivalent to 140 million full-time jobs. Under a pessimistic scenario in a so-called second wave of the pandemic, this figure could rise to 11.9% or 340 million jobs, it said.
""The estimates have revised upwards considerably the damage done to our labour markets by the pandemic,"" Guy Ryder, ILO director-general, told a Geneva news conference. ""So there is not going to be a simple or a quick recovery."" 
The figures cover people who are working shorter hours, who are furloughed, have lost their jobs, or withdrawn from the labour force.
They reflect ""worsening conditions"", especially in developing countries, the report said.
Some 93 per cent of workers still live in countries with some sort of workplace closures, it said.
The pandemic has had a ""disproportionate and damaging effect"" on women workers, who are often employed in hard-hit sectors such as food and accommodation, retail and real estate, Ryder said. 
Asked about Brazil not imposing strict public health measures to halt spread of coronavirus, Ryder said: ""Clearly undue delay in acting on the health side of pandemic is going to bring worse social and economic outcomes.""

""It is inevitable...that the world is going to begin to emerge from this pandemic with higher levels of unemployment, higher levels of poverty, higher levels of inequality, higher levels of frustration among citizens, but also higher levels of indebtedness,"" he said.

European Union governments extended a travel ban for U.S. residents, deeming the American response to the coronavirus pandemic insufficient to allow its citizens to enter the bloc for non-essential reasons.
The decree, which will be reassessed every two weeks, signals that the ban disrupting both business and leisure travel across the Atlantic won’t be lifted until U.S. authorities control the spread of the deadly virus. In the same decision, the EU will lift travel restrictions for Chinese residents as of July 1, on the condition that Beijing confirms that the same applies to EU citizens.
“We appreciate the transparency and concerted efforts of our European partners and allies to combat this pandemic, and we are committed to coordinating with them as we look forward to reopening our economies and easing restrictions,” according to an emailed statement from the U.S. mission to the EU before the decision was made formal.
The EU judgment, which is non-binding on member states, recommends that visitors only be allowed into the bloc from countries where the average number of infections per 100,000 inhabitants over the past two weeks is similar or below the level of the EU and that the trend of new cases is declining.
In addition to China, residents of the following countries are set to be allowed to travel to Europe as of July 1: Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay.

709,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 09:18AM ET</span>","PM Johnson demands Britain 'Build, build, build' to beat COVID-19 slump","By William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to shake Britain's economy out of its coronavirus-induced crisis on Tuesday by fast-tracking infrastructure investment and slashing property planning rules.
As Britain emerges from lockdown, Johnson is looking to move past criticism of his government's handling of the pandemic with a plan to repair the economic damage and reshape the country.
""We cannot continue simply to be prisoners of the crisis,"" Johnson said. ""We must work fast because we've already seen the vertiginous drop in GDP and we know that people are worried now about their jobs and their businesses.""
His message, delivered at a college in the central English town of Dudley, was overshadowed by the announcement of a new lockdown in Leicester, just 50 miles away, where COVID-19 infections are surging.
Nevertheless, with an exhortation to ""build, build, build"", Johnson announced plans to speed up government infrastructure spending and cut through the red tape around planning to make private sector property development easier..
""We will build the hospitals, build the schools, the colleges. But we will also build back greener and build a more beautiful Britain,"" he said.
Promising not to cut spending, he compared his plan to then U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1930s ""New Deal"", which included job-creating public works projects to help the United States recover from the Great Depression.
""It sounds like a prodigious amount of government intervention, sounds like a new deal ... If that is so, then that is how it's meant to sound,"" Johnson said.
SPENT SOONER
Tuesday's headline spending announcement of 5 billion pounds ($6 billion) amounts to around 5% of gross public sector investment last year. Most had already been announced and is only being spent sooner than planned.
""It's not enough,"" Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer told the BBC. ""The prime minister promised a new deal - well there's not much that's new and it's not much of a deal."" 
Kate Forbes, finance secretary for the devolved Scottish government, said the stimulus was below the response of countries like Germany. Layla Moran of the Liberal Democrats said it amounted to ""scrabbling together a few quid rattling around behind the government sofa"". 
The 5 billion pounds of accelerated investment will be made up of projects including hospitals, schools and roads. Finance minister Rishi Sunak will announce further details next week.
Britain's recent history shows that while big infrastructure projects are often seen as a way to create jobs improve the economy, they are difficult to deliver.
A new underground train line in London is over budget and late, as is a north-south high speed rail link. After decades of discussing airport expansion at London Heathrow, the project remains mired in legal challenges.
""The key now is to ensure that these projects get off the ground as a matter of urgency,"" said Stephen Phipson, Chief Executive of manufacturing trade body Make UK.

710,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 09:10AM ET</span>",Fed's offered flood of credit so far just a trickle in practice,"By Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's promise in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic to flood the U.S. economy with trillions of dollars seemed like the proverbial central bank bazooka.
It has been more of a trickle in practice, with activity outside the U.S. Treasury and other core financial markets so far only a fraction of what's available, and with lending to companies in the ""real"" economy virtually nonexistent.
When Fed chair Jerome Powell appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday to discuss the central bank's crisis response he will likely be pressed on that: More than three months into the worst economic meltdown since the Great Depression the Fed so far has made no loans under a vaunted ""Main Street"" program for small and medium sized companies, provided only $1.2 billion to local governments, and holds just $8.3 billion in corporate bonds.
It may, as Fed officials contend, be overall good news, and evidence their mere announcement of support for the economy has kept private lenders and borrowers transacting on their own, kept financial markets stable, and lifted confidence the Fed could keep the worst from happening.
Still, analysts including former Fed chair Ben Bernanke have questioned whether the Fed has been too strict in setting up its programs. While many worked as intended, the fact no Main Street loans have been issued ""is a concern both politically and also in terms of getting liquidity to the firms that need it,"" Bernanke said last week in a Brookings Institution webinar. 
Bernanke said the Fed may need to make its laboriously designed Main Street program ""more generous,"" with lower costs for borrowers or subsidies for banks initiating the loans, if it wants to keep otherwise healthy small and medium businesses from ruin in the crisis. 
""What we need is a compromise where we assist short term survival for small firms while not creating zombie firms,"" that survive on cheap credit alone, Bernanke said. ""It is not clear that the Main Street program ... is going to be enough.""
LITTLE UPTAKE
So far none of the programs set up to backstop companies and markets outside the financial sector have seen much use. By contrast more traditional programs to ensure financial institutions keep doing business in a crisis have been more extensive and by most accounts successful. 
Since late February the central bank has increased its overall balance sheet - a measure of its footprint in the economy - from $4.2 trillion to $7.1 trillion.
Most of that stemmed from keeping the government bond and mortgage-backed securities markets on track: holdings of U.S. Treasuries and MBS increased around $2.4 trillion. Foreign central banks swapping their currencies for dollars accounted for another roughly $230 billion.
What distinguished the response to this crisis from the 2007 to 2009 financial meltdown was the offer to lend directly to private firms and local governments. Announced with fanfare in early April, the Fed said it would, among other steps, provide around $2 trillion to buy bonds to finance large corporations; lend directly to small and medium sized businesses; and help state and local governments raise funds to meet expenses.
Weeks later those programs are up and running - the Fed on Monday launched its latest effort to purchase new corporate bond issues - but of the $1.85 trillion notionally available only about $9.5 billion has been tapped. 
The Fed of course can't make people apply for loans, and the credit costs and other measures that might trigger more aggressive purchases of corporate bonds, for example, have improved since the early days of the pandemic. 
Powell in prepared remarks for Tuesday's hearing said Main Street lending may prove valuable ""in the months ahead"" for firms hit by the dramatic drop in economic activity during the pandemic.
Still, analysts are cutting estimates of how large the Fed's balance sheet might grow during a crisis some thought might test its capacities.
The CARES Act raised the possibility of $4.5 trillion in credit flowing from the central bank. The total may end up less than a fourth of that.

""The usage of the Fed credit facilities has been much slower and smaller than we had anticipated,"" Oxford Economics analyst Kathy Bostjancic wrote last week, estimating perhaps only half of the Main Street loans available will be taken and perhaps less than a third of the corporate bond fund be used.

712,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 07:31AM ET</span>",Madrid taxi drivers demand fleet limits amid weak demand,"MADRID (Reuters) - Thousands of taxi drivers took to the streets of Madrid on Tuesday, honking their horns and clogging up the roads around city hall to demand a limit on the number of vehicles allowed to operate amid a post-lockdown slump in demand. 
During Spain's strict coronavirus confinement only half of the capital's 16,000-strong fleet was in circulation on any given day. But since the state of emergency ended on June 21 they have returned en masse, while demand remains weak.
""As the work has dropped off so much, we are demanding that they stop letting all the taxis out on the same day,"" said taxi driver Jose Antonio Carnero, resting in the shade of Madrid's tree-lined Recoletos boulevard. ""Let half of us out one day, and the other half on the next day.""
Madrid's Federation of Professional Taxi Drivers, which called the protest, said the sudden return to full activity was creating air pollution and unnecessarily exposing its members to the coronavirus.
""The taxi ranks are all full and if you stop on the street around the official stops the police fine you,"" taxi driver Pedro Bustamante told Reuters. ""So you have to drive round and round the city wasting fuel and polluting.""
With more than 28,000 deaths and nearly 250,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, Spain is one of Europe's worst hit countries. It has brought the virus' spread largely under control but the economic consequences are set to last far longer. 

In recent weeks groups ranging from health professionals and hospital cleaners to fairground workers and coach drivers have protested to demand better working conditions.

Wirecard's demise has thrown a spotlight on payments, which is one of the fastest growing sectors in financial services and which central banks could enter themselves by developing digital forms of national currencies.
""One of the key aspects will be how different and non-bank participants and payment service providers can be incorporated into the whole scheme,"" Carstens told reporters. 
Payments have broadened out beyond banks to include so-called fintech firms which offer smartphone apps for making and receiving payments.
For now it was hard to tell if changes in regulation will be needed in the wake of the Wirecard scandal, Carstens said.
""As more details transpire I think that we will be able to pinpoint if or not further supervisory or regulatory action is needed,"" the BIS head added.

The implosion of Wirecard came years after the first allegations of fraud by some investors and journalists and the focus is now shifting to how regulators supervised a company that was hiding a $2.1 billion hole in its books.

714,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>",BIS warns of market 'exuberance' over virus efforts,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank for International Settlements has urged central banks to outline how they plan to reel in coronavirus support measures, but also warned that financial markets may have become too complacent about the scale of the crisis.
The Basel-based central bank umbrella group said in its annual report published on Tuesday that the unprecedented ""sudden stop"" caused by the pandemic was evolving from a liquidity problem into a more fundamental threat to firms' solvency.
""The pandemic is the defining event of a generation,"" BIS General Manager Agustín Carstens said.
The long-term viability of many companies will be tested in the next phase of the crisis, the report says, with the strength of the recovery depending on the evolution of the pandemic and how much damage it leaves in its wake.
The IMF slashed its global economic forecast to a near 5% contraction earlier this month, which if realised, would be the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The number of COVID-19 cases has now topped 10 million.
""Central banks are fully aware of the challenges ahead as the outlook for the world economy is still highly uncertain. Some of these challenges extend beyond their mandate,"" Carstens added.
The success in calming markets and shoring up confidence has, however, helped fuel market ""exuberance"". World stocks are set for their best quarter in 16 years and Wall Street for its best since 1998.
""Equity prices and corporate spreads in particular seem to have decoupled from the weaker real economy"" and ""underlying financial frugalities remain,"" the BIS said.
A wave of credit rating downgrades has already started -- S&P Global alone has taken around 2,000 negative rating actions since the crisis erupted -- and there are concerns that losses might lead to widespread defaults.
""This feels more like a truce than a peace settlement,"" the report said of the current situation.
(Graphic: Timeline of the coronavirus support measures from central banks and governements, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovajqzepa/Pasted%20image%201593510269841.png)
Despite acknowledging the virus was far from defeated, Carstens said central banks needed to prepare markets for the removal of crisis support measures once the situation begins to normalise.
Global central banks have made roughly 150 interest rate cuts this year, while BofA estimates that there has been a combined 18 trillion dollars worth of monetary and fiscal aid ploughed into the world economy.
""The exit strategy is a difficult discussion, nevertheless it needs to be considered,"" Carstens told Reuters, saying the market needed to know the extra stimulus would not be there forever.
Governments will have to continue to help though and the assumption remains that inflation is likely to be pushed up by all the extra money being shovelled into the system.
A more concerning scenario would be the creation of a post-Second World War type situation should a lengthy pandemic leave a much larger imprint on both the global economy and the political sphere.
""In this world, public sector debt would be much higher and the public sector’s grip on the economy much greater, while globalisation would be forced into a major retreat,"" the BIS said.

Critics of the negotiations have raised concerns about the possibility of U.S. firms carving out parts of the NHS and selling food products, such as hormone-treated beef, which are currently prohibited.
""The government remains clear on protecting the NHS and not compromising on the UK's high environmental protection, animal welfare and food safety standards,"" trade minister Elizabeth Truss said after a second round of talks with Washington. 
Truss last week accused the United States of talking ""a good game"" on free trade while keeping many British exports out of its markets.
On Tuesday, she said the talks were ""positive and constructive"" but she reiterated that London was not in a rush to get a trade deal with the United States.
""The government is clear there is no set deadline for this agreement,"" she said. ""Quality is more important than speed."" 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in January that he was optimistic the United States and Britain would strike a trade deal this year.
U.S. President Donald Trump is keen for progress on trade talks before November's presidential election, while in Britain the prospect of a deal has been held up by Brexit supporters as one of the rewards of leaving the European Union.
Truss reported ""good progress"" on a chapter in the talks for small and medium-sized businesses and said Britain had stressed the need for an ambitious deal for its huge financial services. 
On business services, both sides discussed how regulators could work more closely on qualifications and licensing. There was also discussion of ways to help the legal services sector.
A third negotiating round is expected to take place at the end of July, Truss said.

Johnson, whose popularity has flagged over his government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, earlier promised to fast track 5-billion pound ($6.14 billion) of infrastructure spending to jump start the economy, which has been largely shut for three months.
Returning to the promises he made at last year's election, he is targeting much of the spending at those areas in northern and central England, where many traditionally opposition Labour-supporters voted for the governing Conservatives.
The new planning regulations will give greater freedom for buildings and land in town centres to change use without planning permission and create new homes from vacant and redundant buildings.
The changes, which are planned to come into effect by September through changes to the law, include: 
-- More types of commercial premises having total flexibility to be repurposed through reform of the Use Classes Order.
-- A building used for retail, for instance, would be able to be permanently used as a café or office without requiring a planning application and local authority approval.
-- Pubs, libraries, village shops and other types of uses essential to communities will not be covered by these flexibilities.
-- A wider range of commercial buildings will be allowed to change to residential use without the need for a planning application.
-- Builders will no longer need a normal planning application to demolish and rebuild vacant and redundant residential and commercial buildings if they are rebuilt as homes.
-- Property owners will be able to build additional space above their properties via a fast track approval process, subject to neighbour consultation.
-- Work will begin to look at how land owned by the government can be managed more effectively.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union remain far apart in negotiations on a new trading relationship and analysts at many banks say the risk of a no-trade-deal Brexit at the end of the year is firmly back on the table.
Talks are being held this week in Brussels but Britain's refusal to extend the end-2020 deadline has increased pressure to reach a deal by then or be cast adrift without any trading arrangements in place.
""We think there is a 50-50 chance of a no trade-deal Brexit,"" said Sarah Hewin, chief Europe economist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF).
""There are big hurdles still and no one is really talking about Northern Ireland at the moment,"" she said, referring to one of the main stumbling blocks in past negotiation rounds.
Berenberg analysts put a 60% chance on a deal not being reached in time, but expect a transition to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules via small steps, with only a 5% probability of a disorderly outcome.

BARE-BONES DEAL
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) sees a 20% chance of the transition period being extended beyond year-end despite the government's insistence this will not happen. But while assigning only a 10% chance of Britain leaving without an agreement in place, they think any deal will be ""weak with very limited reach"".
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) too predict a deal will be reached but only after the current deadline.
ING economist James Smith sees a 40% probability of a no- deal Brexit - twice as likely as a year ago -- but sees little difference between having a free trade agreement and exiting without one.
""In either scenario the UK is leaving the EU single market and that is where the bulk of the new costs for businesses will come from,"" Smith added.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) FX strategist Kit Juckes assigns a 16.7% probability to a no-trade-deal outcome but sees the UK heading for a bare-bones agreement, adding to strains on the economy.
""If the global economy does badly and we do a bad trade deal we will do worse than most,"" he added.

Investing.com -- China imposed its new security law on Hong Kong, prompting immediate U.S. retaliation. The July 4th weekend is looking more and more under threat of tighter lockdown measures after counties in California and Florida closed their beaches, and Kansas and Oregon ordered citizens to wear masks in indoor public spaces. Stocks are set to open mixed at the end of their best quarter in over a decade, while Jerome Powell is set to warn that the recovery is ""extraordinarily uncertain"". And Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) warned of up to $22 billion in asset impairments due to the lasting hit to oil prices from the pandemic. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, June 30th.
1 China imposes Hong Kong law; U.S. retaliates
China’s top legislative body passed a new national security law tightening Beijing’s control over the formerly autonomous city.
The U.S. government responded by withdrawing the special status on trade that it had accorded to the city.
The news came on a day when the Chinese economy gave further proof of its recovery, with the official manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index rising more than forecast to 50.9, and the non-manufacturing index also rising to 54.4 from 53.6 a month ago.  That was enough to push the price of copper above $2.70 a pound for the first time since January.
2. Powell, Mnuchin to testify as virus fears rise ahead of July 4 weekend
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will address the House Financial Services Committee later, with Powell set to warn that an economic rebound cannot be taken for granted.
“The path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in containing the virus,” according to Powell’s prepared remarks, which were published by the Fed on Monday. “A full recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to re-engage in a broad range of activities.”
Powell’s warning comes as numerous states tighten their measures to contain the virus, threatening to complicate the coming July 4th celebrations. Counties in California and Florida have closed their beaches, while the states of Kansas and Oregon are imposing a requirement to wear masks in indoor public spaces – as is the city of Jacksonville in Florida, where the Republican Party convention is due to take place.
3 Stocks set to open mixed; Boeing's gains trimmed
U.S. stocks are set to open mixed on the last day of what is set to be their best quarter in over a decade.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 54 points, or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 0.1% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was flat.  The Dow underperformed partly because Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock was giving up gains in premarket on news of a big 737 MAX order cancellation from Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC).
The Nasdaq is, by contrast, being supported by strong earnings reported after the bell on Thursday by chipmaker Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and computer hardware maker Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX).
U.S. data due include the Chicago PMI at 9:45 AM ET and the Conference Board’s consumer sentiment index for June at 10 AM.
4. Pound weakens at Johnson prepares to spend, spend, spend
The U.K.’s plans to re-open most of its economy this weekend took a knock as the government was forced to lock down the city of Leicester (pop. 330,000) in response to rising cases of the virus.  
The U.K.’s stuttering exit from its state of emergency was also illustrated by the refusal of Greece on Monday to accept direct flights from the country for another two weeks.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to give a keynote speech today on navigating a way out of the crisis by massively expanding spending on infrastructure and education.
The pound fell to a one-month low against the dollar and remained close to a three-month low against the euro.
5. Shell sees possible $22 billion hit; API Inventories due 
Finding a way out of the corona crisis gets no easier for the oil and gas industry. After the collapse of shale pioneer Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) at the weekend, Anglo-Dutch major Royal Dutch Shell said it will write down its assets by between $15 and $22 billion in the second quarter, to reflect its expectations of a lasting hit to oil prices.
The company still stuck to its long-term forecast of $60 a barrel and $3 per million Btu for natural gas, but said it will take until 2023 for prices to return to this level. For the current year, it expects an average Brent price of $35 a barrel, rising to $40 next year.
The U.S. oil market will receive its latest update on U.S. crude supplies from the American Petroleum Institute at 4:30 PM ET."

The Securities Times first reported the rate cuts.
The three-month relending rate for small firms and rural sectors will be cut to 1.95% while the six-month rate will be cut to 2.15% and the one-year rate will cut to 2.25%, the government-backed newspaper reported.
The rediscount rate will be cut by 0.25 percentage point to 2%, it said.
The central bank will also cut the re-lending rate related to financial stability by 50 basis points, it added.
The People's Bank of China has already rolled out a raft of easing steps since early February, including reserve requirement cuts and targeted lending support for virus-hit firms.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's tourism-dependent economy needs profound structural reforms to avoid ""chronic"" levels of public debt that could hinder long-term growth, the Bank of Spain said on Tuesday.
One of the nations most affected by the coronavirus, Spain is heading for its worst economic performance on record in 2020, with a contraction of 9%-11.6%, as forecast by the central bank.
""In a hypothetical scenario where no structural fiscal effort is made by the authorities in the next ten years, the ratio of public debt to GDP would remain well above 100% at the end of 2030,"" the central bank said in its 2019 annual report.
The report echoed last week's comments by bank Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos stressing the importance of reforms while also predicting some recovery later this year.
However, his institution is also warning of a potentially even sharper contraction this year of 15.1% in a worst-case scenario with a new wave of coronavirus infections.
In those circumstances, the Bank of Spain said on Tuesday the debt-to-GDP ratio could rise up to 126.7% in 2020 and hover around 130% in 2021 and 2022, while the deficit would go up to 14% this year from 2.8% in 2019.
De Cos said in Tuesday's report that it was important for the European Recovery Fund to have the potential to expand.
EU leaders agreed earlier in June that urgent action was needed to help their coronavirus-hit economies, but remain divided over the Franco-German proposal for grants to be made available to severely-affected states like Spain and Italy.
Oscar Arce, the Bank of Spain's director general for economics, told a news briefing that the recovery fund should be approved soon ""with an agile design so that the money reaches the countries in greatest need as quickly as possible.""
He also advised the Spanish government to tap the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) if conditions were more favourable than those of the market.

""It is time to do the math and if it adds up and it is better to tap the ESM, there it is,"" Arce said, adding that it was a mistake to stigmatise access to European resources.

RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - People in Saudi Arabia rushed to buy goods from imported fruit juices to cars ahead of a sharp hike in value-added tax on July 1, introduced by the oil-rich kingdom to boost state revenues amid its worst ever economic decline.
The tripling of VAT to 15% comes against a backdrop of lower consumer spending and an easing of inflation due to a three-month coronavirus lockdown that was fully lifted on June 21. 
Supermarkets in the capital Riyadh were packed over the weekend as shoppers stockpiled non-perishable goods. Furniture and appliances stores offered discounts to lure buyers.
""Demand has been very weak but people are now actively buying ahead of the VAT so there is a bit of demand,"" said Najem Alotaibe, a car dealer in Riyadh.
Jaber al-Sahari, who works in a gold shop, also reported an increase in demand in the last two weeks.
Saudi Arabia announced the VAT hike and suspension of a cost of living allowance in May, shocking citizens and businesses expecting more support from the government.
""Life is getting more expensive. I bought some imported food and juices and stored it because prices will rise,"" said Sarah, a Saudi mother of two.
In recent months inflation eased to around 1% due to low demand for non-food items and reduced fuel prices, but some analysts expect it to surge by up to 6% year-on-year in July due to the VAT hike.
Authorities this month increased import tariffs to contain a ballooning fiscal deficit, which the International Monetary Fund projects at over 12% of GDP from 4.5% last year. 
These steps could reduce the overall deficit by 4.5% to 6% of GDP, but may dampen economic recovery, Arqaam Capital has said. 
For Abu Omar, an Egyptian expatriate, the VAT hike comes on top of a 20% salary reduction due to the coronavirus crisis.

""So now I have to live with 35% less, this will be very difficult with three kids,"" he said.

723,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 06:09AM ET</span>",Fed Hopes for Recovery While Preparing for a Second Virus Wave,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve is preparing for the possibility of an economically debilitating second wave of coronavirus infections even as it’s hoping that can be avoided.
In launching the Main Street and corporate lending facilities this month and starting to buy corporate bonds, the central bank has laid the groundwork for stepped-up support for the economy and financial markets should they be undermined by fresh outbreaks of the virus.
“They want to be ready in case things get worse,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.
Lawmakers are likely to question Fed Chairman Jerome Powell about a resurgence of the virus in some parts of the U.S. when he appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
In testimony prepared for delivery to the committee, Powell stressed the importance of containing the contagion as the economy recovers from its deepest contraction in decades.
“While this bounceback in economic activity is welcome, it also presents new challenges -- notably, the need to keep the virus in check,” he said.
Texas, Florida
Among America’s most-populous states, Texas, Florida and California are experiencing climbing coronavirus cases even while others, including New York, see declines. Overall, counties accounting for between one-third and half of U.S. gross domestic product are suffering from worsening trends in new cases or Covid-19-related deaths, according to research by Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) economists.
U.S. stocks rebounded on Monday after dropping to a two-week low on June 26 as increasing virus infections began stopping progress on reopening the American economy, with Texas and Florida halting drinking at bars.
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George, in remarks on June 25, said that the U.S. economy is likely to begin recovering in the third quarter, but rising virus cases are a risk to the outlook.
Powell has said that policy makers assumed there wouldn’t be a “substantial second wave” of infections when they penciled in their forecasts for the economy at their last meeting on June 9-10. But he and other officials have made clear they’re primed to do more if a widespread outbreak threatens the economy.
Finance First Responders
In the event of a severe second wave, Krishna Guha, head of central-bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said he expects the emergency credit programs that the Fed has launched during the crisis to morph from being little-used backstops for private-sector lending to becoming front-line providers of finance.
That seems to be how Fed officials are thinking.
In explaining why the central bank started buying corporate bonds this month even though the market for such debt has improved substantially, Powell said the Fed wanted to follow through on its commitment to do so and also show it would be able to act forcefully if the economy worsened.
“We just want to be there if things turn bad in the economy,” he told the Senate Banking Committee on June 16. “If things go in a negative direction, we want to make sure that we’re there.”
The Fed has invested about $8.7 billion in bonds and exchange-traded funds through its Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility. The facility, among nine emergency programs the Fed has rolled out since mid-March, has a capacity of $250 billion and is aimed at helping bigger companies cope with the coronavirus contagion.
So too is the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, which the Fed opened for business Monday. The program, which is the last of the Fed’s emergency facilities to become operational, is designed to buy bonds directly from companies upon issuance.
‘Build Substantially’
The Fed has so far not made any loans under its Main Street Lending Program, aimed at helping smaller firms. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren expects participation in the $600 billion program to “build substantially over time,” especially if the U.S. experiences a resurgence of the coronavirus later this year.
“It actually has the potential to be a significant help to a lot of borrowers, both businesses and non-profit borrowers, particularly if the fall ends up being more troublesome than we’re hoping,” he told Bloomberg News in a June 19 interview.
In his prepared testimony, Powell said the program will begin extending credit “soon.”
Wrightson ICAP (LON:NXGN) LLC chief economist Lou Crandall said the Fed might not mind saving a substantial part of its lending capacity as insurance against the risk of future credit crunch, so long as officials are confident that commercial banks are willing to provide financing to such borrowers on reasonable terms.
Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke argued that it’s fine if the Fed’s corporate-credit facility isn’t that active. “It doesn’t need to be big as long as it’s there,” he told a virtual Brookings Institution conference on June 25. “It has succeeded in making the corporate bond market work pretty normally.”
Main Street
The lack of lending by the Main Street Program is another matter. “That is a concern, both politically and also in terms of getting liquidity to the firms that need it,” Bernanke said.
Lawmakers might press Powell on Tuesday to explain why the Main Street loan facility has been slow to gear up.
They also might call on him and Mnuchin to help borrowers in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market. More than 100 lawmakers wrote to the two policy makers last week warning of a crisis in the market if something wasn’t done.
Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., said Powell could offer to alter the terms of the Main Street program if needed while reassuring legislators that the Fed is prepared for any financial fallout from a spike in coronavirus cases.
“If the rise in virus cases creates a bout of financial instability and markets react negatively, the Fed has the tools already at hand to address those challenges,” Meyer said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Nigeria's candidate to head the World Trade Organization (WTO) said she feels ""strong support"" from Africa and expects African leaders to unite behind one candidate as sources following the race said she is gaining broader backing.
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a former finance and foreign minister who has more than 25 years experience at the World Bank, is seeking to replace Brazil's Roberto Azevedo who announced last month he would step down on Aug. 31, in a surprise move at a critical juncture for the body.
Africa has struggled in the past to unite behind one candidate and the Geneva-based watchdog has never been led by someone from the continent before, nor by a woman, and there is broad feeling it is Africa's turn.
""I cannot presume for any group but I can tell you that I feel strong support from the region,"" she told Reuters late on Monday, saying she was having ""very constructive conversations"" among the 164 members.
One delegate described her as ""definitely the favourite"", especially since European Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan dropped out, and likely to be acceptable to China and the United States.
Egypt's Hamid Mamdouh, a former WTO official, is also a candidate and was endorsed by the African Union months ago, before Okonjo-Iweala's candidacy was announced.
For a Factbox of candidates, click here:
The new head's in-tray includes overseeing reforms, clinching a long-overdue multilateral trade deal, coping with a post-COVID recession as well as growing protectionism and U.S.-China trade tensions. 
""The problems are very deep and challenging but they are not insoluble,"" she said, stressing the need for reform including of the body's top court which is a priority for Washington.
Critics say she does not have enough direct trade experience but she says being an outsider is an advantage. Backers laud her negotiating skills, including a deal to cancel billions of dollars of Nigerian debt.
""Over my long career I've managed to build relationships and platforms at levels high enough to be able to dialogue with the right people,"" she said.

Nominations are open until July 8 at the WTO, which traditionally chooses a chief by consensus.

The number of emergency virus loans approved by the U.K. government has topped 1 million, a milestone that highlights the economic damage done by the restrictions to control the pandemic.
The government has paid out almost 43 billion pounds ($53 billion) across its three lending programs, according to new figures published Tuesday. While the rate of increase has slowed in recent weeks, the figures give insight into the number of businesses that need help to stay afloat.
Meanwhile the cost of the furlough plan increased to 25.5 billion pounds from the previous week, a rise of 2.6 billion. That’s the biggest spending increase since the start of June, though the cost of the program tends to rise later in the month as more workers hit their pay day.
A separate program to support self-employed workers held steady at 2.6 million claims and 7.7 billion pounds.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economy will need ""considerable"" support for some time, Reserve Bank of Australia Deputy Governor Guy Debelle said on Tuesday, adding it would be a ""problem"" if the government ended fiscal stimulus in September as initially flagged.
Australia's fiscal response to the coronavirus pandemic is among the biggest in the world at almost 10% of gross domestic product. It comes as the central bank slashed interest rates to a record low 0.25% and launched an unlimited quantitative easing programme to help buffer the economy against the fallout of the global outbreak.
The emergency measures have so far been successful in supporting the A$2 trillion ($1.38 trillion) economy, though further support will be required, Debelle noted. 
""If everything ceases at the end of September then yes that would be a problem,"" Debelle said, responding to a question following a speech. 
""The government's made it very clear in recent days that they are well aware of that and they are considering what they're going to do to address that. We'll find out more in a few weeks' time."" 
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is due to provide an update on July 23 on whether there will be changes to the fiscal package, in particular an extension of support beyond the current end-September due date. 
With the economy in recession for the first time in 30 years, the government would have reason to keep stimulus going.
Official data out on Tuesday showed payroll jobs were still 6.4% below mid-March levels when Australia had recorded its 100th confirmed case of COVID-19. 
The recovery in payroll jobs between mid-April and mid-June represents only around 30% of the jobs initially lost to COVID-19, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said.
Another worry is that an uptick in cases in Victoria could hurt Australia's second biggest economy, with the latest data showing a drop in electronic card spending in the state.
""The pace of recovery has clearly slowed ... and further highlights the importance of supplementary wage support via the JobKeeper and JobSeeker programmes,"" said Sydney-based RBC economist Robert Thompson.
""The future of wage supplement programmes will be key.""

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Major sovereign bond yields, which have been low for years, are expected to be close to current levels for the next 12 months, as the global economy struggles to recover from the impact of COVID-19, a Reuters poll found.
With expectations for weak economic growth intensifying, major central banks are likely to expand their bloated balance sheets, increasing their sway over bond markets.[ECILT/WRAP]
Anticipation of a strong recovery from world-wide lockdowns to contain the novel coronavirus has helped stock markets to rally from lows hit in March.
But sovereign bond yields are not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels in the foreseeable future.
The June 19-26 poll of more than 90 fixed-income strategists and analysts found government bond yields would stay around current levels until end-2020, rising marginally by this time next year.
""We did see some (upward) pressure on bond yields, but we would argue that those pressures will only be temporary because we are still not so optimistic that there will be a simple V-shaped recovery,"" Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at Rabobank, said.
Others were similarly cautious.
""We have our outlook for longer-term sovereign yields as flat - really flat. Central banks don't want yields to rise because lower interest rates help in incentivising spending,"" said James Orlando, senior economist at TD.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year (US10YT=RR) Treasury yield, currently around 0.65%, is expected to rise to 1.10% in 12-months.
A benign inflation outlook, which risks turning disinflationary or deflationary, also explains the subdued yields.
More than 70% of 45 analysts who answered a separate question said disinflation or deflation because of weaker demand was a greater risk after the pandemic subsides.
The remainder predicted higher inflation because of trade friction and shifting supply chains. Those results were similar to a Reuters poll of over 160 economists published last week.
For a graphic on U.S. Treasury yields outlook:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/qzjvqewxrvx/U.S.%20Treasury.PNG
Given the major central banks' uneven record on getting inflation up to target over the last decade and their commitment to keeping monetary policy loose until targets are met, bond yields are likely to stay low.
However, the Federal Reserve is not yet likely to take a more direct approach, such as yield curve control, which the Bank of Japan is using to cap sovereign yields.
""I would argue that the efforts of...quantitative easing and the forward guidance that the Fed is implementing are working, even without explicit yield curve control,"" TD's Orlando said.
Nearly two-thirds - 29 of 44 - of strategists who answered another additional question said the Fed will not introduce yield curve control this year. The remaining 15 said it would.

With major sovereign bond yields seen around current levels over the next six months, U.S. Treasuries, which have out-yielded their peers for much of the past decade, are set to continue doing so over the coming year.
German Bunds (DE10YT=RR) were not expected to turn positive and yields on Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) (JP10YT=RR) are forecast to remain at or close to zero throughout the forecast horizon. British Gilts (GB10YT=RR) were predicted to yield 0.50% in a year's time, 60 basis points lower than U.S. 10-year Treasuries.

Treasury opted against a second postponement of the deadline officials had said they were considering because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Federal income taxes are normally due by April 15, but the deadline was delayed this year by three months due to the pandemic, which has pushed the U.S. economy into recession and thrown millions of people out of work.

730,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 07:50PM ET</span>",Column: What would private equity funds in 401(k)s mean for retirement savers?,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Employer retirement plans are not known for their flashy investments - a majority of 401(k) investors these days use target date funds that invest in broad, diversified equity and fixed income mutual funds that automatically rebalance to minimize risk as retirement approaches.
That has been a healthy, if unexciting, trend. But in the years ahead, some plan sponsors may start spicing things up. Last week, the federal government opened the door for plan sponsors to add private equity funds to their 401(k) plans. Private equity funds invest in everything from buyouts of mature non-public companies to firms getting ready to go public - and even venture capital startups. Until now, these investments have been available only to wealthy and institutional investors. 
The private equity industry has been knocking on the 401(k) door for a number of years, and the attraction is not difficult to understand. Defined contribution plans represent a huge pool of investable funds, holding $8.9 trillion in assets at the end of 2019, according to the Investment Company Institute.
Private equity proponents scored a win last week when the U.S. Department of Labor (DoL) issued a guidance letter outlining how private equity could be added to defined contribution plans under existing rules (https://reut.rs/2BTOymi). The letter could mark a turning point in a broader move to open up private equity investing to less affluent, individual investors. 
In the retail investing world, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing its rules governing sales of private equity, including liberalization of the rules restricting these investments to ""accredited investors"" - those with net worth (excluding their primary residence) of $1 million or more, or annual income of at least $200,000 for single filers ($300,000 for joint filers) for the past two years.
Private equity advocates argue that these funds can produce higher returns over time than the stock of publicly held companies, even net of fees. 
""If you think of the stock market as a way for investors to harness the economic power of gross domestic product and capitalizing on that, a growing portion of that activity today is being held by private investors today as opposed to being in the public markets,” said David O’Meara, senior defined contribution strategist at consulting firm Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW).
A SLICE OF THE INVESTMENT PIE 
But the difference in returns among private equity funds can be huge. And unlike active mutual funds, where top performers do not outperform the market consistently over the long term, top private equity funds have greater “persistence,” because top managers get first look at the highest-quality investments, according to Fran Kinniry, global head of private investment at Vanguard. “You need to have confidence that you can pick managers who are in the top third of performance,” he said. 
If private equity does start popping up in workplace plans, it likely will have a slice of the investment pie in target date funds that will not exceed 15%, experts say.
Among the three largest providers of target date funds - Vanguard, Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price - none are jumping on the bandwagon yet, although none have ruled it out for the future. 
Vanguard, which has long advised foundations and endowments on private equity investments, is now expanding its offerings to high net-worth clients, and next year will begin offering it to clients in its fast-growing Personal Advisor Services who meet the current - or revised - accredited investor standards, Kinniry said.
One challenge for plan sponsors will be how to value private equity on a daily basis. In 401(k) plans, participants are able to check the value of their holdings at any time, but valuations of private equity investments are updated only periodically. 
Meanwhile, the DoL letter lays out some fiduciary hurdles that plan sponsors would have to leap, said Fred Reish, an attorney with Faegre Drinker who specializes in employee benefits. ""It says fiduciaries must have the expertise to be able to evaluate these products, or hire advisers or managers who do. And participants must be given information that they can understand and use to decide whether or not to be in that investment.""
Reish thinks those goals can be met by large, sophisticated 401(k) plans. But he does not expect to see private equity turning up in plans overnight, noting employers are a cautious bunch. “They read all the headlines about other plan sponsors being sued for violations of their fiduciary duties, and it scares them to death.”
In recent years, many of those headlines have been generated by attorney Jerome Schlichter, senior partner at Schlichter Bogard & Denton. He has won more than $350 million in 401(k) excessive-fee cases for employees and retirees, and won judgments that required defendants to improve their plans - relief he values at more than $1.5 billion.
""This is fraught with peril both for employees and companies that choose to do this,"" Schlichter said. ""There’s a reason private equity investments have been limited to wealthy, sophisticated investors. This is grafting a product that wasn’t designed to be in the retirement plan of an average investor into those retirement plans.""

733,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 06:27PM ET</span>","U.S. Suspends Some Trade Benefits to Hong Kong, Ross Says","(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration escalated pressure on China Monday over its crackdown on Hong Kong by making it harder to export sensitive technology to the city, the latest step toward revoking the former U.K. territory’s special trading status.
“With the Chinese Communist Party’s imposition of new security measures on Hong Kong, the risk that sensitive U.S. technology will be diverted to the People’s Liberation Army or Ministry of State Security has increased, all while undermining the territory’s autonomy,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement that provided little detail on specific impacts.
As part of the policy, the Commerce Department said it’s suspending regulations allowing special treatment to Hong Kong over things including export license exceptions.
“Further actions to eliminate differential treatment are also being evaluated,” Ross added, without providing details.
Exports of sensitive technologies to Hong Kong have previously been treated differently from those to mainland China, where exporters have to apply for special licenses. Monday’s announcement revokes the special treatment for shipments to Hong Kong, likely setting up a tedious application process for companies.
President Donald Trump said on May 29 that the U.S. would begin the process of eliminating policy exemptions that give Hong Kong different and special treatment. He announced that the shift would affect the full range of agreements with Hong Kong including export controls on dual-use technologies.
The U.S. move was the latest as relations with China continue to deteriorate over Hong Kong and other fronts. The president continues to blame the country for the spread of the coronavirus. His attacks on China have become part of his re-election campaign. And both nations’ warships and combat jets continue to track each other in the contested South China Sea.
Late last week, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo announced visa restrictions on Chinese officials involved in the Hong Kong crackdown. He did not name any officials. Pompeo said on Monday that the U.S. would cease selling defense equipment to Hong Kong, a largely symbolic act that will mostly affect sales with the city’s police and corrections forces.
Trump delivered remarks last Friday that, while harsh, did not threaten specific punishments for the Beijing government.
At the same time, however, China’s top legislative body is poised to approve the new national security legislation -- a sweeping attempt to quell dissent that risks further U.S. retaliation and Hong Kong’s appeal as a financial hub.
The law brings yet more uncertainty as Hong Kong faces its deepest recession on record after last year’s protests and the global pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said Monday it opposes a $1.5 trillion proposal from congressional Democrats to boost U.S. infrastructure over the next decade, criticizing how it would pay for new spending.
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives is set to begin on Tuesday debating the measure, which includes a massive boost in spending on roads, bridges, public transit, rail, ports and airports as well as water systems, schools and broadband internet. A final vote is expected later this week.
""America’s infrastructure is in crisis,"" House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, a Democrat, said. The country's ""roads, bridges, public transit, rail, airports, ports and water systems are badly outdated, causing stress and safety hazards for our citizens, strain on our economy, and an enormous toll on public health and our planet."" 
The White House said it was ""not a serious proposal,"" saying it ""significantly favored"" urban areas over rural America and that the measure appeared to be ""entirely debt-financed.""
Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline to reauthorize surface transportation spending. White House officials confirmed earlier that President Donald Trump is expected in the coming weeks to unveil his surface transportation spending plan.
Trump and Democratic leaders in April 2019 agreed to spend $2 trillion on infrastructure, but never hashed out how to pay for it. It appears increasingly unlikely Congress will pass any significant funding boost ahead of the November presidential election.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Monday opposed the Democratic bill, calling on lawmakers to take up a bipartisan measure approved by a Senate committee as a starting point. The ""stakes are too high for yet another failure,"" it said.
Congress abandoned largely requiring road users to pay for road repairs and has not hiked the federal gas tax since 1993. Since 2008, Congress has transferred about $141 billion in general revenues to the Highway Trust Fund.

To maintain existing spending, Congress will need to find $107 billion over five years; the House bill transfers $145.3 billion.

""We're reaching out to all the farmers, we're getting a list of these recruitment agencies. We found out some are fly-by-nighters just trying to make a quick buck, so we're going to put an end to that,"" Premier Doug Ford told a press conference.
Some 60,000 people come to Canada on temporary work permits to plant and harvest crops every year, typically staying on one farm all season. Some farms also use labour contractors who move local workers from farm to farm, and that movement may have spread the virus, the local health unit said earlier on Monday.
The hard-hit farming region of Windsor-Essex reported 186 new confirmed coronavirus cases over Sunday and Monday, a 13% increase in total cases, including 183 on a single farm that has not been identified. 
An ""overwhelming majority"" of farms with outbreaks were employing short-term workers through temp agencies, ministry of labour staff said on a conference call about the outbreaks last week.
The issue is not confined to agriculture. North of Toronto in York Region, public health staff have reported temp agencies moving staff between workplaces.
In some cases, the agencies employ undocumented workers, who may feel it is too risky to seek testing, said Karim Kurji, York's medical officer of health.
Most workplace outbreaks in York Region are in manufacturing and wholesaling, Kurji said, adding that sometimes it is difficult to get in touch with temp agencies.
Ontario has said it will pay for COVID-19 screening and care for anyone who needs it, but getting that message out is a challenge, said family doctor and activist Ritika Goel. 

""A lot of people may not know, might still have fear, given their undocumented status,"" she said.

Thailand is looking past the pandemic and pushing ahead with a 290 billion baht ($9.4 billion) “airport city” aimed at creating a destination for travel and manufacturing, according to the head of the project.
The plan is to expand U-Tapao International Airport in Rayong Province, where much of Thailand’s automotive and petrochemical companies have plants and factories. In recent years, the airport brought in tourists from places such as China and Russia to the seaside city of Pattaya.
“It’ll be the core of a new growth center and a hub for logistics and tourism,” said Kanit Sangsubhan, secretary general of the Eastern Economic Corridor Office, which oversees the project spanning 1,040 hectares (2,570 acres). When completed, it will handle 60 million passengers and 3 million tons of cargo yearly, making U-Tapao one of the nation’s three largest airports.
U-Tapao was originally developed in the mid-1960s to support the U.S. military during the Vietnam War.
An initial phase of the redevelopment is due for completion by 2024, giving the aviation hub some “insulation” from the coronavirus-induced economic crisis and collapse of foreign tourism, Kanit said in an interview. Thailand closed its borders to foreign travelers in late March.
However, a challenge is to get businesses to buy into the idea of a new aviation and logistics hub for Southeast Asia.
“The building of infrastructure is easy, but the hard part will be bringing companies and investment to the area,” said Manoj Lohatepanont, director of Chulalongkorn University Transportation Institute in Bangkok.
Other planned features include a free-trade zone, an aviation maintenance center and headquarters for e-commerce and logistics companies. A high-speed train system is being built to connect the airport with Pattaya and Bangkok, about three hours drive away.
Construction of a new terminal is being handled by a consortium of BTS Group Holdings Pcl, Bangkok Airways Pcl and Sino-Thai Engineering & Construction Pcl. Operations will be managed by Japan-based Narita International Airport Corp.
Although the aviation sector has been one of the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, Kanit expects a full recovery by the end of 2021 and forecasts a 1.5 percentage-point boost to annual economic growth from the airport complex’s construction. This year, Thailand is on course for a record contraction of 8.1% of gross domestic product.
The nation’s economic performance has lagged the Southeast Asian region for a prolonged period. The airport redevelopment is part of a wider, 1.7 trillion-baht blueprint to expand advanced industry and infrastructure on the eastern seaboard, as a way of closing the gap.

These could ultimately deploy trillions of dollars in lending.
The programs seek to keep financial markets functioning and, in unprecedented steps, provide direct loans to businesses, states and local governments.
Here’s a round-up of the nine programs -- all of which are now up and running -- with details on their current status. Lending totals are as of June 24, with the exception of the corporate credit and municipal facilities which reflect totals as of June 23. Holdings will be updated every Thursday:
Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF)
Purchases short-term company IOUs directly from U.S. corporate and municipal issuers. Eligible securities about $1.1 trillion. Demand has been low as the Fed’s mere pledge to backstop the market drew normal lenders back in.
Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF)
Buys a wide range of securities -- with an agreement to sell back at a future date -- including investment-grade corporate debt, municipal debt, and mortgage- and asset-backed securities from primary dealers, which are the big banks and broker-dealers licensed to transact with the Fed. Its lending peaked in mid-April at around $33 billion, then faded as the short-term funding markets calmed.
Money Market Fund Liquidity Facility (MMFLF)
Finances the purchase of high-quality assets from U.S. money market mutual funds, including government debt, commercial paper and municipal debt. Eligible securities estimated at $600 billion to $700 billion, according to Fed officials. Lending peaked in early April at around $53 billion as withdrawals from prime money funds halted and then reversed.
Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF)
Will buy investment-grade corporate debt with maturities of up to four years directly from U.S. issuers, and debt from some issuers downgraded after March 22.
Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF)
Purchase investment-grade corporate debt from U.S. issuers with maturities up to five years in the secondary market, debt from some issuers downgraded after March 22 and some ETFs that buy corporate debt. The New York Fed began ETF purchases on May 12 and eligible corporate bonds after June 15.
Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF)
Will purchase securities backed by credits to consumers and small businesses, including credit-card receivables, student loans, auto loans and leases, equipment loans and some small business loans.
Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF)
Finances lending to small businesses that qualify for the Treasury’s Paycheck Protection Program. Congress appropriated a total of $669 billion for the loans, which can turn into grants if companies retain or hire back workers.
Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF)
Will purchase municipal debt maturing in less than 36 months directly from states, counties and cities. After initial criticism, the Fed lowered the population thresholds for eligible counties and cities to 500,000 and 250,000, respectively. Issuers must have held an investment-grade rating as of April 8.
Main Street Lending Program
Will finance full recourse bank lending to U.S. companies with fewer than 15,000 employees or less than $5 billion in annual revenue. The four-year loans will be extended through three distinct facilities: one for new loans, another for increasing existing debt and a third for more heavily leveraged borrowers.

""At the moment, the story looks very good. We're set for a V-shaped recovery,"" National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told CNBC. ""Might it change? Yes, it might and we'll be looking very, very carefully at this.""
A surge in confirmed coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in a number of Sun Belt states has led a number of them to backtrack on measures to reopen their shuttered economies.
That, in turn, has raised questions about how quickly the national economy might bounce back from its deep coronavirus-related dive.
Kudlow said the administration's main goal was to encourage more hiring, adding that it would likely get behind an effort to put in place a re-employment bonus as Congress considers a further round of coronavirus relief.
That would be in lieu of renewing a $600 supplement to weekly jobless benefits approved by lawmakers in an earlier relief bill. Those supplemental payments are due to end at the end of July.
""Our main goal, hopefully, is to get people to get re-employed,"" Kudlow said. ""We want to give them, perhaps, a boost, a benefit for re-employment and we want them to come back to work.""
He said there were numerous anecdotal reports suggesting businesses would find it difficult to attract the workers they need if Congress renewed the supplemental benefits.

He cautioned, however, that the administration had not made a final decision on its position.

Economic activity has picked up in recent weeks after what in some places had been months of shutdowns to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, Powell said in remarks prepared for a Congressional hearing on Tuesday. 
""We have entered an important new phase and have done so sooner than expected,"" Powell said. ""While this bounceback in economic activity is welcome, it also presents new challenges —notably, the need to keep the virus in check."" 
With output and employment still far below their pre-crisis levels, he said, ""the path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in containing the virus,"" again saying that a full recovery is unlikely until people are confident it is safe to be out and about.
""The path forward will also depend on the policy actions taken at all levels of government to provide relief and to support the recovery for as long as needed,"" Powell said.
The Fed has cut rates to near-zero, bought trillions of dollars of bonds and rolled out nearly a dozen credit backstopping programs to boost the economy and steady markets. The Fed has also pledged that it will use the ""full range of tools"" to support the U.S. economy.
Congress has committed nearly $3 trillion in aid.
But more may be needed, Powell signaled, noting that the central bank's as yet untapped Main Street lending facility may prove valuable ""in the months ahead"" for firms hit by a dramatic drop in economic activity during the pandemic.
Some states have begun to dial back their reopenings as coronavirus infections surge.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Private sector participation will be essential to ensuring the success of a debt relief initiative launched by the Group of 20 major economies for the world's poorest countries, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund said on Monday.
The G20's offer to suspend official bilateral debt service payments by the poorest countries would likely need to be extended beyond the end of the year, Gita Gopinath told an online event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.""We absolutely would want the private sector to also be involved,"" she said. ""That would be essential now going forward.""
The G20 secretariat last week said 41 of 73 eligible poor countries had applied for the temporary suspension of debt service payments, freeing billions of dollars of funding for the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
The World Bank estimates the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) agreed by G20 members and the Paris Club of official creditors in April could free up $12 billion for countries to spend on combating the novel coronavirus. 
The initiative has had mixed results, with some countries reluctant to seek relief out of concern it could harm their credit ratings and access to international capital markets.
Gopinath said she viewed the glass as ""half full"" and said the G20 initiative for official bilateral debts was an ""important step"" to help the poorest countries.
Private sector support for the debt initiative is likely to be a key topic when G20 finance ministers meet online in July.

World Bank President David Malpass last week told Reuters the G20 initiative had made good progress, but he called for additional relief and greater participation by private sector creditors.

The Fed released the text of his remarks on Monday afternoon.
The Fed and Treasury have worked together to launch nine emergency lending programs aimed at providing backstop credit to everything from municipalities to medium-sized businesses. Those actions helped lower borrowing costs and keep the financial system liquid in a time of stress.
The Fed chair struck an optimistic note on what he is seeing as economic activity resumes. Hiring is picking up, he noted, and spending is increasing, though 20 million Americans have lost their jobs.
“The path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success incontaining the virus,” he said. “A full recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities.”

743,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 04:10PM ET</span>",Fed opens primary market corporate bond facility,"By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Monday kicked off a long-awaited program to buy newly minted corporate bonds directly from companies, launching the last of the several programs created to stabilize financial markets rocked by the coronavirus. 
Through the $500 billion Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility the Fed will support companies well rated before the crisis that need capital to keep their businesses afloat during the crisis. 
The U.S. central bank's pledge in late March to bolster the corporate credit market has allowed companies access to credit readily despite the uncertainty created by the pandemic. 
The Fed said Monday it does not expect high usage of the facility given current market conditions. Nonetheless it wants the program in place in case market conditions deteriorate. It began purchasing shares of exchange-traded funds in mid-May, and started purchasing individual corporate bonds through the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility this month. 
In contrast to the SMCCF, which purchases bonds in public markets after they are issued, the PMCCF requires companies wanting to participate to apply for certification, with those details disclosed on Monday. The Fed also updated the term sheet for the facility, including specifications on deal pricing.
Through the PMCCF, the Fed has two options to buy debt issued by a company. It can buy an entire new issue of bonds as the sole investor in a deal or it can buy portions of either syndicated loans or new bonds.
Companies can have their debt purchased through both the primary and secondary market facilities, as long as the total amount is not more than 1.5% of the combined maximum potential size of the facilities, which is $750 billion, or 10% of the issuer's bonds outstanding. 

Bonds purchased in the secondary market facility will track a broad corporate bond market index, and the Fed said it will not sell bonds in the secondary market program with the aim of rebalancing the index.

744,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",U.S. Jobless-Claims Figures Inflated by States’ Backlog-Clearing,"(Bloomberg) -- The weekly U.S. jobless claims report shows that 11 million people are on a new federal aid program geared toward the self-employed, accounting for more than a third of total claims across the country.
But that figure -- cited by economists alongside traditional claims in regular state programs as helping provide a more complete picture of unemployment -- likely overstates the true count. In some cases, by a lot.
Eight states and Puerto Rico have reported Pandemic Unemployment Assistance claims higher than those for regular state programs, according to figures released Thursday. On the surface, this suggests there are many more self-employed and gig workers losing their jobs.
In reality, states contacted by Bloomberg News explained that the totals reflect backlogged claims from prior weeks finally making their way through the system. In addition, with each retroactive week counted as a separate claim, one person can account for multiple claims in the tally.
While the inflated weekly figures probably don’t significantly alter the picture of a wide swath of the U.S. workforce being out of a job, they add to difficulties in deciphering what’s happening in the labor market using the weekly jobless claims data -- already rife with quirks, errors, and complications. The claims report gave a misleading signal ahead of the May jobs report, spurring economists to expect a sharp decline in payrolls before the numbers instead showed a record gain.
“The backlogs make it difficult” to get a clear reading on jobless claims, though the broader trend seen in the reports is still helpful, said Brett Ryan, senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB).
A spokesperson for the U.S. Labor Department, which releases national figures each Thursday, didn’t immediately have a comment on the issue on Monday.
One example of the overcounting: Arkansas’s figures showed 134,478 federal PUA continuing claims for the week ended June 6, compared with 113,623 on regular state unemployment benefits.
Zoë Calkins, a spokeswoman for the Arkansas Department of Commerce’s Division of Workforce Services, said claimants can backdate their filing to as early as the start of February. That means a resident who filed for PUA last week and lost their job in that period could file for 21 weeks, and be counted 21 times in that state’s total PUA claims tally.
Counting Weeks
“The continued claims numbers reflect the number of weeks, not the number of individuals that filed continued claims,” she said, adding that “the appearance of the rise in PUA continued claims is due to processing continued claims filed for earlier weeks.”
Hawaii and Pennsylvania’s labor departments had similar responses. Pennsylvania, where PUA claims are 30% higher than regular state claims, also highlighted that the program was relatively new, and cited the backdating.
Also pumping up the figures is fraud that cost a handful of states hundreds of millions of dollars.
Hawaii disbursed about $16 million in benefits for fraudulent claims, and stopped another $77 million from being disbursed. The Secret Service is investigating a Nigerian crime ring in connection with a wave of fraud targeting the PUA program, according to reports in May.
Whether it’s fraud or backlogs, eventually the PUA figures should start to better reflect the number of out-of-work people claiming benefits.
“Like many states across the nation, Idaho did not have a system in place to process PUA claims, therefore the PUA workload was processed in an ad-hoc database,” Salvador Vazquez, a spokesperson for Idaho’s labor department, said in an email. “Future trends for PUA claims will look more normal in the coming weeks.”
Other states with elevated PUA claims either didn’t respond to requests seeking comment or weren’t immediately able to respond.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The number of properties in the United States in danger of flooding this year is 70% higher than government data estimates, research released on Monday shows, with at-risk hot spots in Houston, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. 
The higher risk identified could have implications for property values as well as insurance rates, municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities, according to investors and researchers at First Street Foundation, which released the data http://www.floodfactor.com. 
""This could change the calculus on whether a given property is resalable, or what price you sell it at,"" said Tom Graff, head of fixed income at Brown Advisory. 
The data, which covers the contiguous United States, found that around 14.6 million properties, or 10.3%, are at a substantial risk of flooding this year versus the 8.7 million mapped by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
(For a graphic showing the increased risk: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FLOODS/REALESTATE/yxmpjlrklpr/USA-FLOODS-REALESTATE.jpg)
FEMA maps are currently used to determine rates on government flood insurance and underpin risk assessments done by mortgage lenders, investors and home buyers. The maps, however, primarily account for coastal flooding - not rain or rivers - and do not incorporate the ways climate change has made storms worse.
A FEMA spokesperson said that First Street's maps build on those created by the agency and the two are not incompatible. 
Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, New York and Cape Coral, Florida top First Street's list of cities with the most number of properties at risk. At the state level, Florida, Texas, California, New York and Pennsylvania have the most to lose. Florida and Texas also top FEMA's list, but with significantly fewer properties estimated to be at risk. 
Washington, D.C., has the greatest deviation from FEMA's numbers, 438.4% more properties at risk, because First Street accounts for potential flooding from the Potomac and Anacostia rivers and a drainage basin under the city. Utah, Wyoming, Montana and Idaho have the next highest deviations, all between three to four times greater than FEMA estimates.
Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), investments that pool loans for office buildings, hotels, shopping centers and more, are among the securities most exposed to flood risk because of the concentration of cities on the U.S. coasts.
""There is a moral hazard within the investment community of not pricing in the risk of something like this happening,"" said Scott Burg, chief investment officer at hedge fund Deer Park Road. 
Nearly 20% of all U.S. commercial real estate value is located in Houston, Miami and New York, according to CoStar data, each of which has been hit by hurricanes in the last decade. 
Hurricane Harvey, which slammed Houston in 2017 and caused $131 billion damage, affected over 1,300 CMBS loans, 3% of the CMBS market in 2017, according to BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) research. Hurricane Irma in 2017 affected 2%.
The BlackRock report concluded that 80% of the commercial property damaged by those two storms was outside of FEMA flood zones, indicating that many of the buildings hit may not have been appropriately insured. 
Any floods this year could compound the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, which has sent more than $32 billion of commercial loans into special servicing - negotiations for relief in the event of a default - according to Moody's (NYSE:MCO).
""For property owners that's like getting your arm amputated and then your head lopped off,"" said Jacob Sagi a professor of finance at the University of North Carolina and a First Street research partner.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian province of Alberta, home to the world’s third-largest oil reserves, said on Monday it will accelerate a corporate tax cut and invest C$10 billion ($7.31 billion) in infrastructure projects to jump start an economy badly damaged by the coronavirus pandemic.
Premier Jason Kenney, who said the tax cut would take effect July 1, described the program as the largest infrastructure investment in Alberta's history. The corporate tax rate will fall to 8% from the current 10%, two years sooner than scheduled.
Economic shutdowns due the virus outbreak added to challenges in the oil-rich province from lower crude prices (CLc1) and pipeline congestion, pushing the unemployment rate as high as 25%, Kenney said.
""Given the severity of the economic crisis, we must act now,"" he said during a press conference.
Canada is over the worst of the coronavirus outbreak but a spike in cases in the United States and elsewhere shows Canadians must remain vigilant as the economy reopens, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday.
Alberta's recovery program will create an estimated 55,000 new full-time private sector jobs, and stimulate C$13 billion in economic growth, the province said.
The province will also invest an additional C$175 million to expand access to venture capital for early stage start-up companies while seeking to limit the use of temporary foreign workers to boost local employment, according to the plan.
Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews said the financial supports could jeopardize the province's credit rating. Fitch cut Canada's rating last week.
Toews said the tax cut will cost an estimated C$200 million to C$300 million in the current fiscal year and between C$100 million and C$200 million next year.
Before the pandemic, Alberta's deficit was forecast at C$6.8 billion for the 2020-21 fiscal year.

Infections across the United States are rising and governors in California, Florida and Texas are reinstating some restrictions to stem the tide of new cases. 
From here, Daly said, the outlook will depend in large part on whether widespread shutdowns are again imposed or whether current mitigation strategies are enough to keep the virus in check but allow people to be back at their jobs.
""These are toes in the water ... and we'll see how this shapes up,"" Daly said, adding that so far what she is seeing is ""consistent with a slow and gradual recovery,"" with unemployment bouncing around where it is now.
Fresh data on the labor market for June will be released on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters expect the jobless rate to fall to 12.3% from 13.3% in May.
A new large-scale shutdown, Daly said, would be much more worrisome and would result in a rise in unemployment. 
Asked how she feels about the outlook, Daly said the characterization she would use is ""curious.""

The program was announced in March as a flight from risk began raising borrowing costs for corporations of all kinds. Partly due to Fed interventions, corporate credit spreads have since narrowed and companies have been able to borrow billions of dollars via new financing to take advantage of cheaper credit costs.
The Fed said in its release that pricing will be issuer-specific and informed by market conditions. Prices will also be subject to minimum and maximum spreads over comparable maturity Treasury securities.
Secondary Market
The Fed unveiled its emergency lending facilities and slashed interest rates to almost zero in a bid to support the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Among these is a separate but related lending program called the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility. In May, the central bank began buying exchange-traded funds invested in corporate debt through it and earlier this month started purchasing securities of individual issuers.
Details released by the Fed Sunday show that purchases in the Secondary Market facility so far include bonds issued by companies such as AT&T Inc., UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH). and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. Draw-down of this program has been relatively light. As of Tuesday, the Fed had amassed $8.71 billion of assets including ETFs and individual securities through the program.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German regulators twice looked into tightening the supervision of collapsed payments firm Wirecard and discussed it with the German and European central banks but no action was taken, a person with direct knowledge of the talks told Reuters.
Wirecard's implosion came years after the first allegations of fraud by some investors and journalists and the focus is now shifting to how regulators supervised a company that was hiding a $2.1 billion hole in its books.
In 2017, officials from German financial regulator BaFin and the country's central bank, or Bundesbank, considered placing Wirecard on a list of financial companies to supervise but decided against it, the person said.
In the second half of 2019, there were discussions for months, which involved the European Central Bank (ECB), about putting Wirecard on a watchlist to give authorities more power to investigate it, the person said.
But the talks dragged into 2020 and were still inconclusive when they were ""overtaken by events"", even though anonymous sources had given the authorities information about irregularities at the company, the person said.
The ECB, the euro zone's top authority for banking supervision, and the Bundesbank declined to comment.
BaFin has said it asked Germany's privately-run accounting watchdog FREP in February 2019 to examine Wirecard's accounts but had yet to receive a report.
Wirecard, a hybrid company that processed electronic payments and also owned a bank, was once one of the hottest financial technology, or fintech, firms in Europe with a market value of $28 billion at its peak.
It filed for insolvency on Thursday owing creditors nearly $4 billion and its auditor EY said the massive financial hole in its accounts was the result of an elaborate and sophisticated global fraud.
'SCANDALOUS'
It's not clear why regulators did not tighten Wirecard's supervision though a second source with knowledge of the matter said such a decision would have raised complex legal questions about whether the whole company could be defined as a bank.
As a financial technology company, albeit one that owned a bank, Wirecard was long considered as being in a grey area when it came to traditional bank supervision. 
While BaFin regulated Wirecard's bank, putting the company on a list of financial firms would have put it fully under the supervision of the German financial regulator.
The second source also said getting all the different authorities to reach any agreement about Wirecard's supervision was a time consuming process. 
Nonetheless, the lack of urgency is likely to intensify criticism of BaFin, which has already been attacked for investigating the investors and reporters who questioned Wirecard's accounts - rather than the company itself.
""The events surrounding Wirecard are scandalous,"" said Frank Schaeffler, a German opposition lawmaker who sits on BaFin's supervisory board, adding that the finance ministry, which oversees BaFin, bore ultimate responsibility.
Wirecard started out handling payments for gambling and adult websites and now processes payments for companies including Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). Some of the world's biggest investors held its shares before a whistleblower said it owed its success to a web of sham transactions.
""Regulators ignored the concerns raised, preferring instead to pursue those that warned of this major fraud,"" said Fraser Perring, who bet on a fall in Wirecard's shares and co-authored a 2016 report that alleged fraud.
Following his claims, BaFin launched an investigation into Perring which ultimately led to a criminal inquiry backed by state prosecutors into market manipulation.
Jan Pieter Krahnen, a finance expert at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, said the case showed that Germany's light-touch approach to controlling companies was failing.

""We love self regulation in Germany,"" he said. ""But this is only something that works in good times. Capital market supervision is a low priority for Germany.""

The plan was included in the coalition government's policy programme laid out earlier this month, which said it would be centred around a new recovery fund targeting increased domestic demand and employment.
The programme pledged that additional grants for small businesses will be considered as part of the package, which will also set out the future direction of the state's wage subsidy - currently due to run until at least the end of August. 
""This will be a sizable package that has to meet the challenges of our time and they are very, very significant challenges,"" Martin told a news conference, adding that it was too early to say how much the plan would cost.
""The important thing of the July stimulus is what will work quickly in terms of getting jobs back."" 
Business Minister Leo Varadkar, whom Martin took over from as prime minister on Saturday, said the country was potentially facing mass insolvencies of businesses, meaning the government must act fast with a plan by the second or third week of July.
The percentage of the workforce either temporarily or permanently unemployed stood at 26.1% at the end of May.
Data on Monday showed that while Irish retail sales rose 29.5% month-on-month in May, a rebound that reflected both the partial reopening of the economy and a record drop in April, they were still 26.6% lower than a year ago. 

The ""very limited rebound"" from earlier losses reinforced the case for significant stimulus to avoid a double digit drop in consumer spending drop this year, KBC Ireland Chief Economist Austin Hughes wrote in a note.

753,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>",Brazil political risk looms large again over markets,"By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Political risk is again emerging as a major source of market instability in Brazil, as a series of setbacks for President Jair Bolsonaro sucks the life out of a broad-based recovery that had appeared to be gathering momentum following March's market crash.
Brazil's status as the world's No. 2 COVID-19 hot spot, Bolsonaro's mishandling of the pandemic, his battles with the Supreme Court and Congress, and cabinet resignations have thrust Brasilia firmly into investors' line of vision.
The growing sense of disarray is unnerving investors who fear Bolsonaro's constitutional and institutional spats will put the government's economic reform and austerity agenda on ice, and possibly into a more permanent deep freeze.
""Markets are starting to look at the politics again,"" said Alexandre Song, partner at Macro Capital, a hedge fund in Sao Paulo. 
""The price action hasn't been too dramatic so far, but it is deteriorating. It feels like markets are partying next to a live volcano, and there's smoke coming out,"" he said.
The exchange rate and currency volatility, good real-time gauges of wider market jitters, reflect Brazil's underperformance in recent weeks. The real has fallen 12% against the dollar from its recent high on June 8, more than its peers and in many cases significantly more. 
(Graphic: Emerging FX since June 8, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakpeammlpr/EMFX-JUNE8.png) 
Volatility, meanwhile, has shot up almost to the levels it reached at the height of the global market crash in March. 
Implied volatility on one-month dollar/real options last week rose to 25%, the highest since March, when it reached 30%, and on Friday three-month implied volatility spiked to 21.7%, even closer to the March peak of 22.5%.

The economic and public health issues Bolsonaro is grappling with are not unique to Brazil. The world is tipping into its deepest recession in decades, the COVID-19 pandemic knows no geographical boundaries and people are dying around the world.
But according to Thomaz Favaro, director at Control Risk, a political risk consultancy in Sao Paulo, Bolsonaro's handling of the crisis has put him in a select band of world leaders whose approval ratings have fallen during the pandemic.
""We now have a political crisis on top of a health crisis and economic crisis,"" Favaro said.
""Very few countries have had such a dysfunctional response to COVID as Brazil, and that is adding fuel to the fire in the sense that 'When is the economic recovery going to begin, and how steep or not will that recovery be?'"" he said.
Even lingering speculation about military intervention to tighten Bolsonaro's grip on power, however unlikely, has not disappeared. 
'FRAGILE SITUATION'
The economy is headed for its biggest crash since records began 120 years ago. Emergency spending, meanwhile, will push government debt to a record high, while the number of confirmed coronavirus cases passed the 1 million mark and more than 57,000 people have died. 
Brazilian assets have rebounded from the March lows, in line with the global market recovery. But the benchmark Bovespa index is still 20% lower this year and the real is down 25%, while the spread between short- and long-term interest rates is still more than double what it was in January.
Brazil's pre-pandemic position was weaker than in many other countries, with anemic economic growth, high national debt and a fractious political climate.
In the last two weeks, respected Treasury Secretary Mansueto Almeida said he would step down, controversial Education Minister Abraham Weintraub quit and police arrested a former aide to Bolsonaro's eldest son in a graft probe that threatens to undermine the president and ratchet up his battle with the judiciary.
None of these events on their own might have made any market ripples. But together, against a backdrop of recession and public health emergency, they packed a punch.
""Investors ignore political risk until they don't,"" said Emily Weis, macro strategist at State Street in Boston. 

""The pandemic has exposed some of the government's fragilities, although this is not just an issue in Brazil. It's a really fragile situation,"" she said.

Pyle said that although there had been a strong U.S. fiscal and monetary policy response to COVID-19, there were concerns about the outlook. 
""There are significant risks around the U.S. retrenching (policy support) too soon,"" he said during a presentation on the BlackRock Investment Institute's mid-year outlook.
Pyle said the firm was cautious on emerging markets because of a reduced capacity on the policy front to respond to the coronavirus shock compared with more developed economies, as well as a challenging public health dimension, especially in Latin America.

755,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>",Wirecard collapse leads to call for German parliamentary inquiry,"By Andreas Rinke and Neil Jerome Morales
BERLIN/MANILA (Reuters) - Germany's opposition called on Monday for a parliamentary inquiry into the collapse of payments firm Wirecard after a global fraud that left a gaping hole in its books went undiscovered by auditors and regulators for years.
The request for an inquiry came after Germany said it would cancel its contract with the country's privately-run accounting watchdog FREP as a result of a scandal that financial regulator BaFin has branded a ""total disaster"".
Wirecard filed for insolvency on Thursday owing creditors almost $4 billion after disclosing a 1.9 billion euro ($2.1 billion) hole in its accounts that its auditor EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud. 
FREP President Edgar Ernst told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper that only one employee had been tasked with looking into Wirecard after BaFin asked it to check the company's accounts for the first half of 2018.
The FREP assessment had yet to be finalised by the time Wirecard collapsed.
Liberal member of parliament Frank Schaeffler, who also sits on Bafin's supervisory board, asked for the parliamentary inquiry and said he believed there were both structural and personnel shortcomings at the financial regulator.
""The fact that the Bafin is waiting 15 months for a report from the FREP despite indications of irregularities is absurd"", he said. ""It's like shooting cotton balls at an elephant.""
Another BaFin board member and member of parliament said the German government should be investigated too as there had been frequent reports of problems at Wirecard.
""The role of the finance ministry must be examined, as reports of irregularities have been coming in for quite some time"", said conservative lawmaker Alexander Radwan.
""Fintechs offering financial services need appropriate oversight"", he told Reuters.
A spokesman for the justice ministry said the government was analysing the extent to which audit oversight should be reformed.
The Wirecard insolvency - the first by a member of Germany's blue-chip DAX stock market index - is also prompting Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) to study possible revisions to DAX membership rules, the stock exchange operator said.
Wirecard's implosion came seven days after EY, its auditor for over a decade, refused to sign off on the 2019 accounts, forcing out Chief Executive Markus Braun and leading the company to say that 1.9 billion euros of its cash probably didn't exist. 
EY has said it had clear indications that Wirecard was an elaborate and sophisticated fraud, involving multiple parties in different institutions around the world.
'SWIFT AND THOROUGH'
EY said it had confirmed with officials at Philippine banks BPI and BDO - which have been named as Wirecard partners - that EY received false bank confirmations and statements for Wirecard escrow accounts.
BPI and BDO said Wirecard was not a client and documents purporting to show it had deposited funds with them were false. 
The Philippines' anti-money laundering agency said it would conduct a ""swift and thorough"" investigation into Wirecard. The central bank had said earlier that no money from Wirecard entered the Philippines' financial system.
A Filipino lawyer, Mark Tolentino, who reportedly set up accounts for Wirecard, told Reuters he was surprised to be linked to the German firm and that he did not know until the scandal broke that accounts he set up were for Wirecard. 
While Wirecard said on Saturday it would proceed with business activities after filing for insolvency, regulators are restricting some of its activities, forcing some financial technology firms to suspend services.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said on Monday that while Wirecard was addressing its concerns, restrictions placed on some of its activities would remain in place for now.
A Munich court on Monday appointed Michael Jaffe as Wirecard's administrator.
BaFin is also considering imposing a moratorium on Wirecard's banking division to prevent any money flowing out, people close to the matter said, adding that no decision on such a move had yet been taken.
While former Wirecard Chief Executive Markus Braun has been released on bail following his arrest last week, former Chief Operating Officer Jan Marsalek is not planning to turn himself in, German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported. 
Handelsblatt, another German newspaper, reported that German public prosecutors had issued an international arrest warrant for Marsalek. 
Philippine Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra told Reuters on Friday that Marsalek was in the Philippines on June 23 and immigration records showed he flew to China the next day.
Marsalek's lawyer was not available for comment.

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron promised 15 billion euros ($16.9 billion) of new funding on Monday to speed up moves to a greener economy, a day after the Greens trounced his party and took control of big cities in local elections.
Macron said he would move faster on environment-friendly policymaking and that he was ready to call a referendum in 2021 on revising the constitution to include climate goals if parliament allowed it. But he stopped short of promising one. 
Macron was responding to proposals by a Citizens' Climate Council he set up in response to the ""yellow vest"" movement that sprang up as a backlash against the cost of living but became a rebellion against him and his pro-business reform agenda. 
""The challenge to our climate demands we do more,"" he told members of the climate council in the Elysee Palace's garden, hoping to burnish his green credentials for the final two years of his presidency.
He made no reference to Sunday's vote, in which his LaRem party failed to win in any big city, leaving Macron, 42, without a local power-base as he eyes a possible bid for a second term as president in 2022.
The Greens won control of cities including Lyon, Bordeaux and Strasbourg, often in alliance with leftist allies, and is a junior partner in the winning Socialist-led alliance in Paris. It could also still emerge victorious in Marseille.
""We were given a real slap in the face, it's really brutal,"" Bruno Bonnell, a LaRem member of parliament, told Reuters. 
CHANGE OF PRIME MINISTER?
Bonnell said Macron should replace Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, who is from the conservative right, adding: ""If we get back to doing half-baked right-wing policies, we'll get another drubbing in regional elections"".
But another ruling party member told Reuters that Philippe, who won back his old mayoral seat in Le Havre, was ""really solid"" and should remain prime minister. 
Ditching Philippe would help Macron start afresh, but the prime minister's popularity has risen as he calmly guided France through the coronavirus crisis. 
Sacking him now could create a potential rival for Macron in 2022. Asked about Philippe's future, a source close to Macron said ""continuity"" would be the order of the day. ""I can't see why we should change the prime minister,"" a government minister close to Macron said.
A government reshuffle is likely next week, after Macron gives it some consideration, another government source said.
Macron supported many measures proposed by the 150-member Citizens' Climate Council, but rejected others that would have clashed with his pro-business agenda.
He backed a proposal for a moratorium on new commercial zones in city outskirts, and said he would consider bringing in a new law against ""ecocide"", defined by the council as any action causing serious environmental damage.

But Macron said a proposal for a 4% tax on dividends to help finance new greener policies would discourage investments.

757,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>",Stalled Argentina debt negotiations ensnared by Pac-Man fears and legal wrangles,"By Karin Strohecker and Cassandra Garrison
LONDON/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's debt talks have gone cold with the country at loggerheads with its creditors over the legal terms of a $65 billion bond restructuring after coming tantalisingly close to a financial agreement. 
Argentina's government extended a deadline for talks earlier this month to July 24, the biggest delay yet, to allow time to defuse tensions.
With the two sides only a whisker apart in terms of valuation of their proposals, the wrangling has shifted to the collective action clauses (CACs) which determine the requirements for any future changes made to the bond agreements.
""The next phase may focus more on legal as opposed to financial terms,"" said Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed income strategy at Amherst Pierpont Securities.
As analysts and creditors game out various scenarios, some fear Argentina could adopt what has been dubbed the ""Pac-Man"" strategy and attempt to get creditors on board one at a time - in much the same way as the 1980s video-game character gobbled up ghosts. This would make it harder and harder for remaining creditors to block any deal, but could also aggravate relations with them.
Morden considers this a high-risk strategy and worst case scenario, while a protracted standstill remains most likely. 
CACs make it easier for countries to push through an orderly debt restructuring by requiring only a majority of creditors to agree to change payment terms or otherwise restructure debt.
The widespread adoption of ""enhanced"" CACs by the international community from 2014 went a step further by allowing borrowers to bundle together multiple bonds, making it even harder for minority hold-outs pushing for a better deal to disrupt the process. 
Argentine Economy Minister Martin Guzman admitted that differences over CACs with the major Ad Hoc Bondholder Group including the likes of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) and Fidelity had caused the recent snag. 
""Part of what created a lack of understanding is the legal terms that were suggested by the Ad Hoc Group for a restructuring deal,"" he said during a recent Council of the Americas event. ""And that's not something that Argentina can commit to.""
'GO BACK IN TIME'
Legal wrangles over enhanced CACs - broadly untested to date - could have ramifications well beyond Argentina at a time when economic strife threatens to push more developing economies into debt overhauls, say restructuring experts. 
In its latest proposal, the Ad Hoc Bondholder group https://www.argentina.gob.ar/sites/default/files/joint_proposal_adbg_y_ebg.pdf said it wanted new bonds to be issued using the same legal terms as existing 2005 bonds.
That would mean a restructuring vote would need to clear an 85% threshold on an aggregate vote of the relevant debt as well as a 66% bar for individual bond-by-bond votes, giving more protection to creditors. 
Meanwhile nine-time defaulter Argentina is pushing for the enhanced CACs, under which there is only a single threshold generally set at 75%. 
""They have been endorsed by the G20, the IMF and ICMA and now we are being asked to go back in time and remove those enhanced collective action clauses,"" Guzman said. 
Bondholders say Argentina is trying to bend the system, requesting the right to decide https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/914021/000119312520113997/d915520d424b5.htm which bonds would be included in a restructuring deal - even once a vote on such a deal had passed. 
""What is so frustrating to creditors is this is not what the CACs are for,"" said one bondholder source with knowledge of the talks. ""They have turned this on its head."" 
Mark Sobel, chairman of economic policy and central bank think tank OMFIF said almost all emerging market foreign law sovereign bond issuers have adopted the enhanced CAC standard, and a shift backwards could stoke more risky litigation.
""Any undermining of the new global standard could hurt other emerging markets using enhanced CACs in their quest for more orderly and predictable contractually based sovereign debt restructurings,"" he said. 
The Argentina talks, meanwhile, have largely ground to a halt, the bondholder source added. 

""Nothing is happening,"" the source said. ""There are no discussions happening, and that is not a good sign.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England (BoE) has told banks and insurers to press ahead with analysing the impact of climate change on their operations, saying that guidance published on Monday would be followed by targets next year.
The guide drawn up by the Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF), which was set up by the BoE and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority last year, is the first of its kind and sets out how financial firms can analyse and disclose risks from climate change and spot opportunities for new consumer products.
Sarah Breeden, the BoE's co-chair of the CFRF, said firms should start on their analyses straight away using the guide that is based on best practice from firms.
""It's much easier said than done. It takes time to develop,"" Breeden told an online launch event for the guide.
The forum will reconvene next month to agree on strategy for next year.
""I expect this to include some sort of thematic work on data, on metrics and on targets,"" Breeden said.
The sector is already facing increased demands due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other challenges such as ending the use of the Libor interest rate benchmark.
Daniel Klier, global head of sustainable finance at HBSC bank, said ""tone from the top"" was key to success. ""It will only happen if you hear it from your leaders,"" he said.
Capital rules for insurers needed ""a little bit of a nudge"" to make it easier for them to invest in climate-friendly projects, added Nigel Wilson, chief executive of Legal & General Group.

Breeden said that while guide did not have the force of mandatory rules, it does set out what the BoE expects from the firms it regulates.

761,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 06:18AM ET</span>","A cash cliff spells trouble for U.S. unemployed, and everyone else","By Jonnelle Marte and Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - Judith Ramirez is bracing for July. That's when the hotel housekeeper and her electrician husband - who have both been out of work for three months - expect their combined unemployment benefits to drop by more than half, and their deferred $1,500 monthly mortgage payment on their Honolulu home to come due. 
It's a cash cliff millions of Americans face this summer as the emergency benefits -- which lifted U.S. consumer incomes by a record 10.8% in April -- expire. The loss of that safety net looms in the weeks ahead, well before a sustained recovery is likely to take hold from the sudden and deep recession brought on by the novel coronavirus. Personal income dropped 4.2% in May, data Friday showed. 
The $600 supplement Congress added to weekly unemployment benefits is due to expire July 31. 
Without new support, recipients face a substantial loss of income - particularly devastating for those like the Ramirez family who worked in hard-hit sectors like hospitality where new jobs are scarce. During high unemployment and a still-raging pandemic, the end of enhanced jobless benefits could drag on consumer spending, set off a wave of missed rent and mortgage payments and translate to a slower recovery, economists said.
That's a great concern for Rachel Finchum, 55, who lost her job at a Nashville-based T-shirt printing company after 18 years. She has sought forbearance on her mortgage but is worried about what will happen when the government programs run out.
""I'm very scared to think I may not be able to make my bills,"" Finchum said. ""With my future so uncertain, I have a house payment and bills based on 18 years of what I was making.""
BENEFITS LIFTED SPENDING 
As the novel coronavirus pandemic exploded in March and local authorities shut down large parts of the U.S. economy, the Trump administration and Congress softened the blow by moving quickly to roll out a patchwork of emergency aid. 
The centerpiece: stimulus checks for most households and more generous unemployment benefits for tens of millions of newly jobless Americans. 
The combined cash aid provided $3 in support for every $1 in lost income in April, Oxford Economics' Gregory Daco estimated. And until it expires on July 31, the extra $600 weekly unemployment payment on average makes up for income lost due to unemployment and reduced hours, he said. 
Indeed about two-thirds people eligible for unemployment benefits can collect more in benefits than they earned while working, researchers from the University of Chicago found.
For low-wage workers like Ramirez, the help was particularly critical. Households across the board slashed spending as coronavirus-related restrictions began in March. But after the government began issuing stimulus checks, lower-income households resumed spending much faster than higher income households, with much of the cash going to basics like utilities and groceries, said Michael Stepner of Harvard University's Opportunity Insights. 
Outlays by low-income households are now only about 3% below pre-crisis levels, versus minus 13% for high-income households. https://tmsnrt.rs/384vT2Z
When the extra benefits run out, jobless benefits will revert to their typical pre-pandemic levels, low by design to encourage people to look hard for work. In 15 states, the maximum unemployment benefit would replace less than half of the median earnings for a worker with a high school diploma, according to Kathryn Anne Edwards, a labor economist for the RAND Corporation. 
That may pressure some people short on cash to risk their health to take a low-paying job at a restaurant or delivery company, which may expose them to the virus, said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives and a former Federal Reserve economist. ""That's a very terrible choice for our policymakers to be telling people they need to make,"" she said.
And with unemployment expected to stay high and businesses in some sectors unable to open, many won't be able to find even those jobs, she said. 
The drop-off in support is also a problem for the economy as a whole, reducing GDP by 2.5% in the second half of 2020, estimated Jason Furman, a Harvard professor who ran the Council of Economic Advisors under President Barack Obama.
Congress may consider at least a partial extension of the benefits, but the uncertainty is making some families cautious about their spending, said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. 
""Lower-income households are worried that the pandemic will re-intensify and disrupt their incomes further,"" said Zandi. ""They are also unsure of how much - if any - more help is coming from Washington D.C."" 
Ramirez, 40, spent a month chasing down her unemployment benefits after she stopped working in late March. When the payments finally started arriving, Ramirez banked them to build a cushion. 
Knowing that the benefits are going to be reduced dramatically and unsure of when they'll get back to work, Ramirez and her husband are living frugally. To save money on groceries, they wake up at 5 a.m. about once a week to get in line at a nearby food bank.
Ramirez will likely have reduced hours if she gets her job back in August, her manager told her. The hotel that employed her husband is still shut down. 
""We need to have a backup,"" said Ramirez, whose daughters are ages 1 and 5. ""I have children to feed.""
For Finchum in Nashville, there is no prospect of a return to her old job. Her employers were nearing retirement so decided to close the business down when the pandemic struck.

""The stimulus package has been a life saver,"" she said.

Johnson said he would double down on his plans to increase investment and said his government - which has already announced emergency spending and tax measures worth an estimated 133 billion pounds - would continue to help people and businesses.
""This is the moment for a Rooseveltian approach to the UK,"" Johnson told Times Radio on Monday.
Former U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's ""New Deal"" programme, which included a raft of job-creating public works projects, helped the United States recover from the Great Depression.
""I do think the investment will pay off because this is a very, very dynamic, very productive economy,"" Johnson said, promising a platform that would encourage companies to invest in capital and in skills training.

The updated figure from the Debt Management Office on Monday represented a 50 billion-pound increase from its previous estimate for the April-to-July period.
Britain's government has ramped up its bond issuance to pay for a surge in borrowing caused by a collapse in economic output during the coronavirus lockdown.
The DMO said it would keep up the current pace of debt sales until the end of August, having already raised more than 181 billion pounds in bond sales since April.
The plan to raise at least 275 billion pounds in the first five months of the 2020/21 financial year is more than double the 136.8 billion pounds remit for the entire 2019/20 financial year.
An emergency public spending surge and tax cuts, combined with a slump in tax revenues, will blow a nearly 300 billion-pound hole in the budget in the current financial year, the country's fiscal watchdog has said, taking deficit to wartime levels.
The DMO said it planned 33 auctions of gilts in July and August and they would be of a similar size to sales in recent months. It will publish details of planned debt sales for September to November before the end of July.

769,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 03:25AM ET</span>",Coronavirus rekindles global trade disputes,"By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - At the start of the year, U.S.-China tensions were easing after their Phase I trade deal, while Washington, Brussels and Tokyo agreed on new global trading rules to curb subsidies. A relative calm had set in.
Then the new coronavirus struck.
Countries across the world imposed 222 exports curbs on medical supplies and medicines and in some cases food, according to Global Trade Alert, a Swiss monitoring group. For medical products, it was more than 20 times the usual level.
Those curbs are now being lifted, but the pandemic has reinforced protectionist arguments by highlighting how global supply chains can deprive people of essential medical protection and disrupt food supplies, as well as threaten jobs.
U.S. President Donald Trump has said he wants to cut ties with China, the European Union is planning barriers to state-backed investment from China and elsewhere and China is demanding declarations that food imports are virus-free.
Former EU trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom said there was a ""worrying"" tendency towards protectionism in the world and the re-emergence of trade conflicts briefly paused by the health crisis.
""Trade-wise we should be concerned,"" she told a seminar on Wednesday.
The World Trade Organization said on Tuesday that global trade in goods was set for a record fall this year and that wider restrictions could see a 2021 rebound falling short.
In the past fortnight, the United States has withdrawn from negotiations with European countries over a tax on digital firms and pledged a ""broad reset"" of its set of tariffs agreed with World Trade Organization partners.
It has also threatened tariffs on a new range of European products, including fresh olives, bakery items and gin, to maintain pressure in a 16-year dispute over aircraft subsidies.
RHETORIC VS REALITY
To some extent, political rhetoric is running ahead of reality: U.S. China trade rose in April after COVID-19-related falls and U.S. officials have said China is committed to buying more U.S. goods in line with the Phase 1 deal.
Chinese leaders and EU chiefs met virtually last Monday, although Brussels told China to make good on its promise to allow greater access for European companies and criticised its actions on the coronavirus and Hong Kong.
China offered deeper cooperation on COVID-19 and urged the EU to relax export controls. On Wednesday, Beijing said it was opening up seven more sectors to foreign investors.
Beijing and Brussels are keeping up contacts with Washington and some progress has been made in limited EU-U.S. talks on food standards and technology cooperation.
Senior EU and U.S. trade officers are holding talks every three weeks, officials say. China's most senior diplomat Yang Jiechi also met with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Hawaii on Wednesday, although Trump renewed his threat to cut ties with Beijing the next day.
BIDEN
Trade is a bellwhether for the cooperation and trust needed to help economies recover, particulary those of smaller countries, said Rohinton Medhora, president of Canada-based think tank the Centre for International Governance Innovation.
Both China and Europe are bracing for rocky relations in the leadup to the U.S. presidential election, but see some hope if Trump's Democrat challenger Joe Biden wins.
""Biden as president is the only chance for China-U.S. relations to regain rationality,"" said Zhu Feng, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Shanghai's Fudan University.
But he did not expect relations to change dramatically in the short term. There is broad bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress for being tough on China, and European optimism over more cooperation with Washington is also tempered.
Reinhard Buetikofer, a trade expert of the Greens in the European Parliament, did not envisage a return to the ""golden years"" of the Clinton or Obama administrations if Biden won.
""I don't expect Biden to be soft on Europe... The mood has changed to a huge degree, not only in Washington, even more so in the U.S. states,"" he said, although he did envisage an approach more tuned to creating alliances.
U.S. figures show a trade deficit with the EU in goods and services of $109 billion in 2018.
Rebalancing the relationship with Europe, including on trade, was a core U.S. national interest, according to Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of trade think-tank ECIPE. 
""The difference between the current administration, or the next or previous is really more about table manners,"" he said.

770,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 02:50AM ET</span>",Yield curve control a double-edged sword for BOJ as low rates strain banks,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan's push to keep borrowing costs low to cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus is coming at the expense of the country's lenders, which are already buckling under the strain of decades of ultra-low interest rates.
Rising credit costs are hurting financial institutions of all sizes. But the hit has been particularly hard for the smaller regional banks, which make up about half the lending extended in Japan and are already reeling from a shrinking economy and margins that have sunk to a meagre 0.2%.
Their plight highlights the BOJ's policy dilemma - the more it flattens the yield curve, the more it squeezes the very lenders it needs to help revive the economy.
The BOJ's experience underscores the inherent difficulty in managing yield curve control (YCC) at the very time the policy - long a tool in Japan - is gaining more attention from central banks around the world as a way to fight the pandemic-sparked downturn.
It also highlights the BOJ's struggle in figuring out the appropriate shape of the yield curve – one that would help finance the government's huge stimulus package at low cost, without crushing yields of longer-dated debt too much.
""COVID-19 has transformed YCC into a tool to help government issue debt smoothly,"" said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research. ""The tricky part is that in doing so, the BOJ inflicts huge damage to banks and weakens their ability to lend.""
Banks typically earn profits by procuring cheap short-term funds and lending long-term at higher rates. The BOJ's policies have squeezed long-term yields, narrowing margins to the extent of stoking concerns over the viability of some weaker banks.
Japan has over 100 regional banks which focus on lending to companies in the areas they are based in. With close and long relationships with borrowers, they can play a key role in revitalising regional economies.
Over 70% of Japan's regional banks suffered a fall in profit or chalked up losses in the year that ended in March. Their combined bad loans were worth 3.7 trillion yen ($34.5 billion), up 2% from a year ago and nearly four times the profit from core operations.
Their bad loans could spike in coming months as they respond to government requests to boost lending to pandemic-hit firms and as Japan's recession deepens, analysts say.
The BOJ itself warned in April the pandemic, if prolonged, could destabilise Japan's banking system as years of ultra-low rates have prodded lenders to take on more risk.
""It's been tough for us under negative rates, so it would be really, really nice if the BOJ helps steepen the yield curve,"" Tetsuya Kan, head of Kansai Mirai Bank, a regional lender based in Osaka, western Japan, told Reuters.
For a graphic on central bank balance sheets, click https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-CENTRALBANKS/010041ZQ4B7/index.html
UP OR DOWN?
The BOJ adopted YCC in 2016, pairing a below-zero short-term rate with a pledge to guide 10-year bond yields around zero.
While YCC aimed to spur growth by capping borrowing costs, it also intended to ensure a sliver of a lending margin for banks by preventing longer-term yields from sliding into negative territory.
Mindful of the rising cost of prolonged easing, the BOJ sought to raise rates when the economy was improving in 2018.
The attempt failed, and now leaves the central bank having to choose between supporting borrowers and banks - and forced to choose the former to boost the economy.
A recent rise in super-long yields to a more than one-month high has drawn renewed market attention on the BOJ.
While the BOJ has kept a tight grip on 10-year yields, it has allowed yields for longer-dated bonds to move more flexibly.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said earlier this month there was no change to his view that excessive falls in super-long yields were undesirable as they hurt bank profits.
But he also said the BOJ wants a ""stably low"" yield curve, causing some confusion in the market as to whether the bank wanted to push super-long yields up, or down.
Masahiko Loo, portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) in Tokyo, said the BOJ was trying to find a ""sweet spot"" where the curve isn't too steep - but not entirely flat. ""I think they're still looking for the balance here,"" he said.
Investors will get some clues on the BOJ's thinking on Tuesday, when it announces its bond-buying plans for July.
With the government planning to ramp up bond sales by more than 30% from July to fund a huge stimulus package, some investors expect the central bank to increase purchases.
An increase in buying of super-long bonds would reverse more than three years of slow tapering the BOJ had undertaken to ease the strain of a flat yield curve on financial institutions.
""The BOJ probably isn't ruling out an increase"" in purchases of super-long bonds with the economy in bad shape, said a source familiar with its thinking, a view echoed by another source.
""In times like this, it's important to keep borrowing costs low and stable,"" the source said.

771,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 02:50AM ET</span>","China's factory activity likely slowed in June on subdued global demand, Reuters poll shows","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity likely grew for the fourth month June but the pace may be waning, as global demand stayed subdued while a fresh coronavirus outbreak in the Chinese capital and rising worldwide cases threaten to undermine a gradual domestic recovery.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI), due for release on Tuesday, is expected to ease to 50.4 in June, from 50.6 in May, according to the median forecast of 29 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity.
With travel bans finally lifted in April in Wuhan, the epicentre of the country's coronavirus crisis, China has largely managed to recover from strict lockdowns that had led to weeks of economic paralysis.
Yet export demand has remained weak with infections steadily rising across the world. Some fear a worldwide recession might turn out to be more pronounced than expected in the event a second wave of coronavirus cases force many countries to reimpose strict lockdowns.
Earlier this month a cluster that has steadily grown to more than 200 cases associated with a food market emerged in Beijing, underscoring the ever present economic threat posed by the virus. 
""We received a stark reminder this week that the fight against COVID-19 is not over, as new cases globally thrice reached new highs,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note Monday.
'NOT MUCH ROOM'
The fallout from the global pandemic has left factories in China, and elsewhere, operating below strength amid slack demand.
""China's work resumption has become stable. There is not so much room (for a rebound) compared to the previous months,"" said Hu Yanhong, a researcher at Yingda Securities. 
In May, China's exports beat expectations with a 3.3% fall thanks to pandemic-related medical supply demand. However, Capital Economics noted this boost is ""unlikely to last as the transition to working-from-home reverses and stockpiling of masks and other protective equipment slows"". 
Underscoring persistent pressure on the manufacturing sector, China's producer prices fell by the sharpest rate in more than four years in May.
Beijing has announced a range of measures to bolster the economy and support jobs. The state cabinet this month flagged plans to further use monetary tools such as bank reserve ratio (RRR) cuts and relending to help firms secure cheaper loans. 

The private-sector Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI, which analysts say focuses more on smaller export-driven firms, is expected to have also eased in June, slowing to 50.5 from the previous month's 50.7. The private PMI survey is due on Wednesday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Tetsuya Kan, head of a major regional bank in Osaka, said it will take two more years for the western Japan prefecture to recover from the damage caused by COVID-19, which has crushed the city's once thriving tourism and retail sectors.
The vast number of Asian tourists who had flocked to Osaka's shopping arcades disappeared after Japan banned entry for most overseas visitors, hitting hotels, restaurants and drug stores.
""The fate of the region's economy depends on how long the pandemic will persist, and whether the restaurants and hotels can bounce back,"" said Kan, president of Kansai Mirai Bank, the fourth largest lender in Osaka prefecture.
""The damage from the pandemic (on the region's economy) will probably last for about two years,"" he told Reuters on Friday.
The pandemic has added pains to regional banks like Kansai Mirai, already reeling from narrowing margins due to decades of ultra-low interest rates and a shrinking domestic market.
Kansai Mirai and its smaller merged partner Minato Bank expect combined credit costs to nearly triple from year-before levels to 12.5 billion yen ($116.6 million) in the fiscal year that began in April.
""This is a conservative amount that took account future potential risks, so I don't think actual costs will exceed this sum. But we can't be complacent,"" Kan said.
 Kansai Mirai Financial  Group (T:7321), to which Kansai Mirai Bank belongs, saw net profit from core business operations fall 7% to 25.7 billion yen in the year ended in March. It expects profits to fall to 21 billion yen in the current fiscal year.
The number of bankruptcies in Osaka stood at 71 in May and may nearly triple in June, according to private think-tank Tokyo Shoko Research.
Osaka's unique food culture and proximity to ancient cities like Kyoto had made it among the most popular destinations for foreign tourists until COVID-19 hit.
The prefecture attracted over 12 million overseas visitors in 2019. While there is no data available on Osaka this year, total overseas visitors to Japan fell to a record low 1,700 in May, down 99.9% from a year ago.

774,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 28, 2020 08:09PM ET</span>",South Korea’s Finance Minister Rules Out Further Extra Budgets,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korean Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki ruled out the need for a fourth extra budget this year and said that the economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic may have bottomed.
South Korea’s economy can still avoid its first annual contraction in more than two decades if stimulus measures including a third supplementary budget submitted to parliament get carried out quickly enough to build on the momentum of improving exports and consumer confidence, Hong said in an interview with Bloomberg on Friday.
“We are seeing signs of consumption and exports recovering from May,” Hong said in his Seoul office. “What’s more important than pouring out more measures and money is ensuring that the third extra budget and the series of measures taken in the first half feed through.”
The government has so far pledged more than 270 trillion won ($225 billion), or roughly 14% of its gross domestic product, to support businesses and families hit by the pandemic. Though most economists expect South Korea’s GDP to contract this year for the first time since the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, Hong reiterated that the government’s 0.1% projection isn’t out of reach if policy efforts are swiftly implemented.
Exports may show surprising strength toward the end of the year as major trading partners reopen their economies, Hong said, with chips, ships and medical supplies leading the recovery.
South Korea’s exports slumped more than 20% in April and May, but early trade data point to a more moderate fall this month amid resilient chip demand and more purchases from China.
“The atmosphere for an improvement of exports is turning more favorable,” he said, while adding that overall shipments will still likely contract for the year.
The Bank of Korea has also done its part to avert a deeper downturn, cutting rates to a record 0.5% and providing unlimited liquidity via repurchase agreements. While pledging to keep monetary policy accommodative until the economy recovers, Governor Lee Ju-yeol recently flagged the need to prepare for an eventual policy normalization to prevent financial distortions.
Hong said he understands Lee’s concerns from a monetary policy perspective, but added that the focus must stay on economic recovery for now.
“The timing is too early to talk about normalizing the supply of liquidity as many companies are still complaining about a lack of liquidity,” Hong said.
The government’s stimulus measures are expected to push up South Korea’s debt-to-GDP ratio to about 43%, but that’s still very low compared with the OECD average of around 110%, Hong said.
South Korea still has fiscal room for further action, though the pace of debt increase could be a concern, he said. The government is looking to propose rules limiting debt accumulation in late August, he added.
As for ongoing minimum wage discussions for next year, Hong said the economic situation under the coronavirus should be considered by the committee that sets the rate of increase, as well as the welfare of workers.
The minimum wage rose by double digits in 2018 and 2019 after President Moon Jae-in took office vowing better living standards for workers. The pace slowed to 2.9% for this year amid a backlash from businesses.
“I’m keeping a close eye on this because the decision would have a large impact on the economy,” Hong said.

Germany's Constitutional Court ruled in May that the ECB overstepped its mandate with over 2 trillion euros of government bond purchases, ordering the Bundesbank to quit the scheme unless the ECB can prove proportionality within three months.
Peter Huber, a conservative judge at the court who drafted the ruling, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that the court was no longer involved and the decision on whether to quit rested with Germany's central bank.
""The Bundesbank is bound by our decision, but it must determine on its own responsibility whether the ECB's statement of reasons fulfils our requirements or not,"" Huber said. ""The Federal Constitutional Court is no longer involved.""
The ruling set off an unprecedented legal conflict with a national court looking to exert jurisdiction over an institution of the European Union and trying to curtail its policy framework, seen as an encroachment on ECB independence.
In a compromise deal, the ECB agreed last week to give vital documents underpinning its policy decisions to Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, who can then present them to the German parliament and government, as demanded by the court ruling.
Astrid Wallrabenstein, a judge-designate at the court, told a newspaper last week she was optimistic a solution to the row over the ECB's bond purchases can be found.

Wallrabenstein, who was nominated by the pro-European Greens, is expected to make the Constitutional Court, widely seen as having a narrow Eurosceptic majority, less confrontational toward the ECB.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Coronavirus has done to Australia what even the global financial crisis couldn't: abruptly end a record growth run and help trigger a deep recession from which the country will take time to recover.
While Australia has had great success so far in heading off the pandemic, with just over 100 deaths, the cure of shutting out the rest of the world means massive hits to three key growth drivers - tourism, education and immigration.
Fiona Gulin was 18 when the last recession hit Australia in the early 1990s. Back then, she managed to keep a part-time job at a music publication, before moving on to full-time work and a lucrative career in the entertainment industry. 
This time, she hasn't been so lucky.
""I have been hit hard in this recession,"" said Gulin, who was laid off in April as the marketing director of the ANZ Stadium in Sydney, prompting her to ditch her rented house in the city and move back to her home in Melbourne. 
Gulin is among the hundreds of thousands who have lost their livelihoods overnight to the COVID-19 pandemic as Australia suffers its first recession in 30 years and its unemployment rate hits a 19-year high of 7.1%.
Even though Australia's economy was among the first to reopen after lockdowns worldwide and earlier than the government expected, it contracted 0.3% in the first quarter and a new wave of coronavirus cases could put a recovery at risk.
Women have been particularly hard hit. 
The unemployment rate for females looking for full-time work surged to 8.3% in May from 5.4% in February before coronavirus-driven shutdowns kicked in. That compares with 7% for men from 4.8% in February.
""Australia is known as the lucky country but I am not very lucky at the moment,"" Gulin, who is receiving government welfare payments, told Reuters.
""I have been talking to a few people about some opportunities but nothing has come up yet.""

VULNERABLE SERVICES
During the unprecedented run of growth, Australia transformed into an open, services-driven economy, feeding China's rise with its mineral and commodity wealth and shedding much of its manufacturing capability.
The services sector accounts for almost two-thirds of Australia's A$2 trillion ($1.4 trillion) annual economic output - but is now particularly vulnerable to the closure of national borders and social distancing measures to tame coronavirus.
""The tourism-dependent economies are the ones we worry about the most,"" said Citi's global chief economist, Catherine Mann.
Mann sees a V-shaped rebound for manufacturing generally but for the services or consumer discretionary sector, ""it is absolutely an L-shaped recovery,"" she said, meaning it could take a while for growth to fully recover.
""What was lost in the early part of this year will never be recovered from the standpoint of revenues for a company.""
VIRUS SHADOW
Policymakers, too, are worried about the long road back to economic health. 
(GRAPHIC: Australia consumer confidence sinks, jobless rate surges - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvgoomnvq/Pasted%20image%201593141836115.png)
The Reserve Bank of Australia has pledged to keep its benchmark cash rate at a record low 0.25% until there is progress in achieving its employment and inflation goals. 
""We're going to have low interest rates for a long period of time,"" central bank Governor Philip Lowe said last week, adding that there would be ""a shadow from the virus for quite a few years.""
""People will be more risk averse, they won't want to borrow. In Australia, we're going to have lower population dynamics,"" Lowe said, referring to the idea that fewer foreigners entering the country would lead to lower consumer demand and a tighter labour market.
Puja Basnet, an international student from Nepal, is reconsidering her options in Australia after losing her part-time job as a waitress.
""I was at home for two months without work and I have almost run out of my savings. As a non-Australian I don't even have access to Centrelink,"" she said, referring to government welfare payments.
For Basnet, the future is even more challenging as more people are now jostling for each job. 
An L-shaped recovery also means the unemployment rate will stay higher for longer.

""I am really worried about the future. I have been applying for 30-40 jobs a week but there has been zero responses.""

Widespread confinement measures in place since late March have dealt a major blow to Latin America's second-biggest economy, as it suffers through its deepest recession in decades.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said in an eight-minute recorded video message on Sunday that he expects a ""fast recovery,"" noting that after the workforce shed about 900,000 formal jobs in April and May, he expects to lose only 70,000 in June.
""We will stop the fall,"" he said, seated behind his desk at the ornate national palace and wearing a casual guayabera shirt.
If the economy does not add formal jobs in July, Lopez Obrador predicted there will be such gains in August, referring to jobs registered with social security institute IMSS.
Formal jobs stem from contracts and include defined pay and tax obligations, while informal jobs mostly operate in cash and outside the law.
Slightly more than half of Mexico's workforce is thought to be informal.
The government has previously announced a gradual economic reopening from June 1, allowing ""essential"" industries including carmaking and mining to resume operations, but increasing novel coronavirus infections and deaths could dampen the recovery.
Lopez Obrador, a leftist populist in his second year in office, also heralded a reworked North American trade pact with Canada and the United States set to go into effect on July 1.
""This will mean more investments, this will mean more jobs, more well-being for Mexico,"" said Lopez Obrador.
He added that he expects remittances this year through June from Mexicans in the United States to relatives back home to have grown by 10%.

The budget airline also said in a statement that despite undergoing a ""deep restructuring"" it has been able to maintain its 6,000-strong workforce thanks in part to unspecified support for its workers' union.
Since March, lockdowns have kept legions of would-be travelers at home, which have starved airlines of cash and led to bankruptcy filings for carriers including Chile-based LATAM and Colombia's Avianca.
Mexico's tourism industry has been especially hard hit by the fallout from the pandemic.
Interjet said in its statement that it had already begun restarting some routes from June 16.
It said in July it plans to restart routes to seven domestic destinations from its hub in Mexico City, including the second and third biggest cities, Guadalajara and Monterrey, respectively, as well as Cancun beach resort. 
International service to Dallas and Houston will also restart in July, and routes to Los Angeles and Chicago in August.

""This will continue in a gradual way,"" the company's statement said, adding that reopening national routes will be first priority and re-launching international flights will depend on each country's reopening rules.

780,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2020 01:55PM ET</span>","Big tobacco, big oil and Buffett join Fed's portfolio","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve bought $428 million in bonds of individual companies through mid-June, making investments in household names like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and AT&T as well as in major oil firms, tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM), and a utility subsidiary of billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) holding company.
The transactions disclosed Sunday are the first individual company bond purchases made by the Fed under new programs set up to nurse the economy through the coronavirus pandemic. The Fed also added $5.3 billion in 16 corporate bond exchange traded funds, including a newly added sixth high yield fund.
The initial round of purchases included some 86 issuers, about half of them contractually settled as of June 18 and some still underway, all bought on the secondary market.
That is a small slice of the more than 790 issuers whose bonds the Fed has said in a separate release were eligible for purchase.
But it was still a first foray into corporate bond purchases that spread broadly across the economy, touching firms like Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) that are involved in developing treatments for the COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus, as well as major automakers. That included Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co., whose credit was downgraded to junk status after the Fed announced its intent to buy corporate debt.
Both the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank have programs to buy individual corporate bonds, but the Fed only added that to its arsenal in light of the Depression level risks posed by the pandemic. The aim is to ensure companies can continue to finance themselves, and not be forced out of business due to problems raising cash during a pandemic. The program is backed by investment capital from the U.S. Treasury to absorb any losses should corporations default.
The largest purchases were of bonds issued by AT&T and the United Health Group, with the Fed buying around $16.4 million of bonds from each.
Issuers in the energy industry accounted for about 8.45% of the bonds purchased, about a percentage point less than their representation in a broad market index that the Fed says its purchases are intended to track over time. 
The Fed's bond purchases and other emergency programs will be scrutinized by lawmakers at a Tuesday hearing before the House Financial Services committee with Fed chair Jerome Powell. Questions may focus on the individual bonds purchased, but also on the fact that support for the bond markets used by major firms is now up and running and getting billions of Fed support, while the Fed's Main Street Lending Program for smaller companies has yet to make a loan.

The central bank's programs overall have so far seen modest use. The central bank's overall balance sheet has declined for the past two weeks, falling to $7.08 trillion more recently as foreign governments made less use of Fed dollar swap lines.

781,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2020 01:30PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Facebook ad boycott campaign to go global, organizers say","By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) - Organizers of a  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) advertising boycott campaign that has drawn support from a rapidly expanding list of major companies are now preparing to take the battle global to increase pressure on the social media company to remove hate speech.
The ""Stop Hate for Profit"" campaign will begin calling on major companies in Europe to join the boycott, Jim Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, said in an interview with Reuters on Saturday. Since the campaign launched earlier this month, more than 160 companies, including  Verizon Communications  (N:VZ) and  Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR), have signed on to stop buying ads on the world’s largest social media platform for the month of July.
Free Press and Common Sense, along with U.S. civil rights groups Color of Change and the Anti-Defamation League, launched the campaign following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man killed by Minneapolis police. 
""The next frontier is global pressure,"" Steyer said, adding the campaign hopes to embolden regulators in Europe to take a harder stance on Facebook. The European Commission in June announced new guidelines for tech companies including Facebook to submit monthly reports on how they are handling coronavirus misinformation.
The outrage in the United States over the death of Floyd has led to an unprecedented reaction from corporations around the world. Its impact has been felt beyond U.S. borders. Unilever, for example, changed the name of a skin-lightening product popular in India called Fair and Lovely.
The global campaign will proceed as organizers continue to urge more U.S. companies to participate. Jessica Gonzalez, co-chief executive of Free Press, said she has contacted major U.S. telecommunications and media companies to ask them to join the campaign.
Responding to demands for more action, Facebook on Sunday acknowledged it has more work to do and is teaming up with civil rights groups and experts to develop more tools to fight hate speech. Facebook said its investments in artificial intelligence have allowed it to find 90% of hate speech before users report it. 
Expanding the campaign outside the United States will take a bigger slice off of Facebook’s advertising revenue but is not likely have major financial impact. Unilever, for instance, on Friday committed to pausing its U.S. spending on Facebook for the rest of the year. That only accounts for about 10% of its overall estimated $250 million it spends on Facebook advertising annually, according to Richard Greenfield of LightShed Partners, a media and tech research firm.
Steyer said they will urge global advertisers such as Unilever and Honda, which have only committed to pausing U.S. ads, to pull their Facebook ads globally.
Annually, Facebook generates $70 billion in advertising sales and about a quarter of it comes from big companies such as Unilever with the vast majority of its revenue derived from small businesses.
But the publicity around its hate speech policies have hurt its perception and stock. On Friday, Facebook's 8.3% decline in stock price wiped out $56 billion in market capitalization. 
The renewed push to urge more companies outside of the United States to join demonstrates the level of frustration felt by social justice groups and the companies that support them over Facebook’s lack of action on misinformation and hate speech, Steyer said. 
He and Gonzalez said Facebook’s efforts on Friday to introduce new measures to ban ads and label hate speech from politicians to appease boycotters fell short of the campaign’s demands.
“If they think they are done based on Friday, they are sorely mistaken,” Gonzalez said. “We don't need a one-off policy here and there. We need comprehensive policy.”
Stop Hate for Profit has outlined a set of demands, which include a separate moderation process to help users who are targeted by race and other identifiers, more transparency on how many incidents of hate speech are reported and to stop generating ad revenue from harmful content.
Moreover, Facebook did not address demands that it refund companies whose ads are displayed next to content that is later removed for policy violations, said Ian Orekondy, chief executive of AdComplyRx, an advertising tech company that helps pharmaceutical brands with their digital ads, which has joined the boycott.

The boycott has accelerated to include other digital advertising platforms such as Twitter. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) said Sunday it would pause advertising on all social media platforms while it works with civil rights organizations to ""stop the spread of hate speech.""

Inflation in Europe's single currency bloc is at its weakest in four years, standing at 0.1% in May and forecast to average 0.3% in 2020, far below the ECB's target of close to but less than 2%.
""We will need a very loose monetary policy until that objective is in plain sight,"" Villeroy said in the interview. 
Villeroy, who is also the governor of France's central bank, said the coronavirus crisis was increasing the deflationary risks weighing on the euro zones' economies, mainly because demand was recovering more slowly than supply.
He said it was out of the question to ""give in to fiscal domination"" and distort monetary policy so as to lighten the burden of public debt.
But he said the inflation objective could be clarified during a strategic review on being symmetric, meaning an equal tolerance of undershooting the target as of overshooting it.
Villeroy said the review would bring more credibility to the target.
He also expressed optimism a solution would be found following a ruling by Germany's Constitutional Court over ECB bond purchases that sent shockwaves around Europe. 
In its May ruling, the court gave the ECB three months to justify bond purchases under its stimulus programme or lose the Bundesbank as a participant.
""There is now hope that a solution to respond to Karlsruhe is close,"" Villeroy said, referring to the top court.

Asked if the ECB should buy junk debt as part of its bond purchases, Villeroy said: ""I exclude that we buy bonds that were 'junk' before the crisis.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson will launch a plan this week to get Britain ""moving again"" after the coronavirus lockdown, when the government will set out measures to boost infrastructure construction, interior minister Priti Patel said on Sunday.
Johnson will make a speech on Tuesday to set out plans to fast-track building projects such as hospitals, schools, housing, and road and rail infrastructure, part of efforts to try to stem a fall in support for his government.
The British leader has been criticised for his response to the coronavirus crisis, with opposition parties and some scientists saying the government was too slow to bring in a lockdown, too slow to carry out widespread testing and not clear in its messaging.
But Johnson, who won a large majority at last year's election, hopes to revive his fortunes by returning to his pledges to ""level up"" Britain by focusing spending on traditional Labour-supporting areas that backed his Conservative Party.
""It's an important plan ... As we move out of this awful, awful period of coronavirus, this dreadful disease, we want to get Britain moving again,"" Patel told Sky News.
""We are building now very much a road to recovery, a roadmap, focusing on infrastructure right now ... focused on roads, broadband, the type of things that effectively help to create jobs but also provide services and economic growth and opportunity around the country.""
Despite the likely questions over the bill for such works, Johnson repeated that his government would not return to the austerity policies seen under Conservative former prime minister, David Cameron. He told the Mail on Sunday newspaper that he was going to act fast ""to build our way back to health"".
According to pollster Opinium, more of the public favour opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer as prime minister over Johnson, although the Conservatives still hold a lead in terms of voting intention.
PARTIES
Some scientists fear that Britain is on course for a second wave of coronavirus, not helped by some people holding parties and large gatherings after Johnson announced a further easing of England's lockdown in early July, when pubs and restaurants can reopen.
""My concerns with the UK government are sometimes less with the substance ... I'm more concerned that the messaging ... seems much more that it's all over and you can go back to doing everything as you did before,"" Mark Drakeford, the first minister of Wales, told Sky News.
Patel said people should still follow the guidelines.

""It's important that the public realise that this virus has not disappeared at all,"" she said. ""We are still in a health emergency ... People need to follow the guidance.""

787,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 28, 2020 06:22AM ET</span>",Economic Calendar - Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,"By Noreen Burke 
Investing.com -- The surge in virus cases in the U.S. South and West will continue to be a major driver of risk sentiment this week. The main event on the economic calendar will be the June jobs report, due out on Thursday, a day earlier than usual because of the Independence Day holiday. Investors will be watching the employment figures along with other economic data for signs that the rebound remains in effect. There will be a host of Federal Reserve speakers along with the minutes of the Fed’s June meeting. Investors will also be monitoring simmering geopolitical tensions and appearances by Bank of England officials, who could hint at shifting monetary policy preferences. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
Five U.S. states, including Florida and Arizona hit record daily highs for coronavirus cases on Saturday and the number of confirmed U.S. cases of the virus rose to more than 2.5 million, a quarter of the world’s total, according to Reuters. The surge in cases has been most pronounced in a handful of Southern and Western states that were among the first to lift lockdowns.
The resurgence in cases is preventing economic activity from fully resuming, prompting investors to weigh expectations of further stimulus in the coming weeks.
One element of Congress' fiscal aid, a $600 per week supplement to unemployment insurance payments, is set to expire at the end of July.
“Our outlook for the economy is probably going to have to change"" without further stimulus said Michael Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.
Economists are forecasting that the U.S. economy will add three million jobs in June after a shock 2.5 million gain a month earlier. But the two months of gains would still pale in comparison to the approximately 22 million jobs that were lost in in March and April.
The ISM manufacturing index, out Wednesday, is expected to rebound sharply, but even if it rises back to the 50 level that separates growth from contraction the level of activity will still be down sharply from were it was at the start of the year.
Consumer confidence figures are due out on Tuesday and the weekly report on initial jobless claims will be released Thursday at the same time as the nonfarm payrolls data.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are due to testify before the House Financial Services Committee Tuesday about the economic stimulus unleashed in response to the virus.
The Fed will publish the minutes of its June rate-setting meeting on Wednesday. Before that, New York Fed President John Williams will be speaking Tuesday on a panel with the International Monetary Fund while Fed Governor Lael Brainard is due to speak about the Dodd-Frank Act at a webinar co-hosted by the Brookings Institution and the University of Michigan.
This week could see a potential flare-up in U.S.- China tensions with Beijing due to pass new national security laws for Hong Kong.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday Washington was imposing visa restrictions on Chinese officials responsible for restricting freedoms in Hong Kong.
Last month, President Donald Trump responded to China's plans by saying he was initiating a process to eliminate special economic treatment that has allowed Hong Kong to remain a global financial center since its handover by Britain in 1997.
Concerns that an escalation in tensions between Washington and Beijing could jeopardize Chinese purchases under a Phase 1 trade deal Trump agreed with China in January have spooked investors already worried about a surge in coronavirus cases.
Investors will be closely watching appearances by Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and Chief Economist Andrew Haldane this week for any indications of a shift in monetary policy guidance after a surprise decision to taper the bank’s bond buying stimulus program.
The BoE bolstered its firepower by a further 100 billion pounds -- as predicted by most economists -- but surprised financial markets by saying it expected the increase to see it through to the end of the year.
The BoE’s decision to slow the pace of its huge bond buying program was accompanied by a comment from Bailey that he’d prefer to unwind the balance sheet ahead of raising interest rates -- a break from the Carney-era guidance that this process wouldn’t occur until interest rates hit 2%.

Germany's Constitutional Court ruled last month that the ECB overstepped its mandate with 2 trillion euros worth of government bond buys over the past five years and ordered the Bundesbank to quit the programme, unless the ECB could prove within three month that the purchases were proportional. 
But Schnabel said that ECB bond buys - sharply increased since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic - were vital in holding the bloc together and actually protect ordinary savers, contrary to the Court's view and much of the criticism from Germany.
""For the average saver, the additional losses arising from our new policy measures are very small,"" Schnabel said. ""The measures taken by the ECB in response to the crisis have been necessary, suitable and proportionate to ensure price stability in the euro area.""
The ECB has agreed to around 1.5 trillion euros worth of additional government bond buys since the outset of the crisis, and to get the same accommodation with rate cuts alone it would need to cut the deposit rate to minus 1.7% percent, Schnabel argued. 
""Had we instead cut the rate on the deposit facility to counter the current crisis, the estimated losses (for savers)would have been almost as large as the total losses accumulated over the course of the past six years,"" she said.
Schnabel also pushed back on the idea that keeping borrowing costs down for indebted euro zone members was beyond the ECB's mandate and created moral hazard for governments.

""It would go against the very idea behind the common currency if we were to stand idly by and watch the pandemic carve a rift into the euro area and produce deep divisions that would endanger the return to a single monetary policy in the long run,"" she said.

Billionaire Leon Cooperman recently warned that the rise in Robinhood trading will ""end in tears"" as according to him many of these day-traders are unaware of the risks.

Bank Indonesia (BI) Governor Perry Warjiyo said he and Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati had agreed to accelerate budget deficit financing and for the central bank ""to ease the government's burden"" of responding to the outbreak.
""The point is BI is ready to provide financing for the state budget and share the burden,"" Warjiyo told a seminar hosted by the IPB School of Business.
The central bank and the finance ministry are in their final stage of agreement for the deficit financing scheme and they would work with parliament's finance commission and the Audit Board of Indonesia to ensure accountability, Warjiyo said.
Lawmakers last week pressured BI to step up its bond buying and purchase zero coupon government debt in a bid to help combat the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, even after the central bank made its third interest rate cut this year.
Warjiyo reiterated in the seminar that BI has scope to trim its main policy rate further.
BI has so far in 2020 bought 40 trillion rupiah ($2.83 billion) of government bonds directly in auctions, as a non-competitive bidder, with pricing determined by the market. It has also purchased 166.2 trillion rupiah of bonds in the secondary market.
In total it has injected 614.8 trillion rupiah of liquidity into the financial system, including via bond buying operations, the governor said.
The fiscal deficit this year is expected to be 6.3% of GDP, up from an initial plan of 1.8%, with the government forecasting a 10% drop in revenue and allocating nearly $50 billion for the COVID-19 budget.
Indonesia recorded a total of 51,427 coronavirus cases as of Friday, with 2,683 deaths.

(Reuters) - U.S. food and feed exporters are shipping goods to China with letters assuring the safety of their cargo in lieu of official declarations requested by Chinese authorities that guarantee coronavirus-free shipments, a U.S. agricultural export group said on Friday.
The commitment statements, drafted by the Agriculture Transportation Coalition (AgTC), are meant only to assure importers that shipments have been harvested, processed and handled consistent with industry safety standards and guidelines from medical experts.
The move comes after China's customs authority last week asked food exporters to the country to sign official declarations their produce is not contaminated by the novel coronavirus.
Chinese demands for the guarantees have roiled the food and agriculture sector and are causing some shippers to forego the China trade, U.S. produce growers group said on Friday.
""You're not signing your name to a guarantee that they have no coronavirus. Nobody can do that. Coronavirus does not live on food or plants,"" said Peter Friedmann, executive director of AgTC, which represents mostly exporters of U.S. agricultural products in shipping containers.
Exporters cannot guarantee that cargo will remain free of the virus after it leaves their facilities, Friedmann said.
""If a Chinese customs inspector has the virus and he handles something, someone can come back later and say that shipment has coronavirus,"" he said.
Chinese customs officials have not confirmed that the commitment statements are acceptable replacements for their official declarations, but no AgTC members have reported any related shipping issues to date.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The piercing boom of illegal fireworks in New York is music to the ears of Joe VanOudenhove, who runs a legal fireworks business in Pennsylvania.
VanOudenhove is by no means the only source of the nighttime explosions that have drawn a raft of complaints in New York, but his stores are enjoying an unprecedented pyrotechnics craze in a country constrained by the coronavirus.
""It's a banner year for the fireworks industry,"" he said. ""The uptick in demand and sales of fireworks is coast to coast.”
VanOudenhove, the managing partner of Sky King Fireworks whose 20 stores in four states make it one of the largest purveyors of fireworks on the East Coast, estimates that recent sales are up from 50% to 200% from last year, more than anything he has seen in 25 years.
A ""perfect storm"" of forces is behind the burst of demand for the sky rockets, roman candles and other glittering and exploding consumer grade fireworks Sky King sells, VanOudenhove said. 
But much of it has to do with families being starved for entertainment in a locked-down world without concerts or sporting events, he said.
""A few weeks ago, we had a family drive to Erie, Pennsylvania, from either New Jersey or New York somewhere and spend $150 on fireworks because they just wanted to get out of the house,” he said.
The fireworks rage has shattered the evening quiet of many a U.S. neighborhood, prompting a flood of complaints, especially in New York where calls to police about fireworks in the first half of June jumped one-hundredfold from last year.
VanOudenhove said on Friday he has not seen any out-of-state police around his stores since New York officials launched a fireworks crackdown on Tuesday.
Customers are asked to sign forms saying that they understand the rules of the fireworks' final destination, he said.
And they keep coming.
“I don't think we'll see this again,"" he said. ""I think is a one-time deal.”

HOUSTON/MIAMI (Reuters) - Bar and restaurant owners in Texas and Florida were fuming on Friday after state officials abruptly slapped new restrictions on their businesses due to a spike in new COVID-19 cases. 
Owners warned the sudden reversals, just weeks after accelerated reopenings, will drive some out of business.
""You can't turn a bar into an UberEats,"" said Jeff Kaplan, co-owner of Houston's Axelrad Beer Garden. He said businesses could not stay afloat relying on the new rules that provide to-go sales but not alcohol consumption on the premises. 
Houston officials advised residents to stay home, and Texas ordered doctors to end elective surgeries as new coronavirus cases set records on three consecutive days. Florida reported nearly 9,000 new infections on Friday, also a record high. 
Houston restaurant owner Peter Mitchell said his revenue has been running a third of normal and fell further as virus cases soared in the region.
""It'll be a close call as to whether we stay open,"" he said. 
""I wish we had tougher restrictions for another month when we did the 25% occupancy (phase),"" said Mitchell. He said his business never has exceeded 25% occupancy, but noted that no regulators have ever checked. 
Florida owners also complained that counties and cities in the state had inconsistent operating rules.
“The level of ambiguity that we’ve run into every step of the way has been really challenging,” said Will Thompson, owner of Miami’s Jaguar Sun. ""It comes back to the lack of clarity from officials.” 
Gabriel Orta, whose company runs hotel food and beverage operations in Miami, said rules are inconsistent. ""We don’t have the leadership that we need when we go into a catastrophe,"" he added. 
Anthony Wegmann, who ran four bars and restaurants in Texas, closed two after a landlord would not grant a reprieve on rent. ""There's no way a business can pay 100% of their bills on 25% of their revenue,"" he said. 

Some are willing to accept the loss of business for the public good. ""It was a little unexpected,"" said Sara Murray, manager of the Cheers Pub in Friendswood, Texas. ""In the end we all have to do what we have to do to keep everyone safe.

""We have to think that there may be some real pain that might be on the horizon,"" he said, adding that cities should try to reserve funds to help renters and homeowners who could lose their housing.

(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Friday said U.S. President Donald Trump was wrong to divert $2.5 billion meant for the Pentagon to build part of his long-sought wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
In a pair of 2-1 decisions, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the White House lacked constitutional authority for the transfer, noting that Congress had denied the funding and finding no ""unforeseen military requirement"" to justify it.
The court also said California and New Mexico, which share a border with Mexico and were among 20 states suing the government, had legal standing to pursue their claims.
Trump had declared a national emergency at the border in February 2019 to access the funds.
Writing for the majority, however, Chief Judge Sidney Thomas said ""the Executive Branch's failure to show, in concrete terms, that the public interest favors a border wall is particularly significant given that Congress determined fencing to be a lower budgetary priority and the Department of Justice's own data points to a contrary conclusion.""
The Justice Department had no immediate comment.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra praised the San Francisco-based appeals court for halting Trump's ""unlawful money grab,"" and said taxpayers deserve to know their money goes where Congress intends.
The appeals court also ruled that the Sierra Club and Southern Border Communities Coalition could sue over the diversion and deserved an injunction.
That ruling may be symbolic, after the U.S. Supreme Court said last July the nonprofits likely had no legal right to sue.
The Supreme Court also let the $2.5 billion be spent while litigation continued.
That blunts the likely impact of Friday's decisions, which totaled 184 pages and upheld lower court rulings.
Both judges in Friday's majority were appointed by President Bill Clinton, while the dissenting judge is a Trump appointee.

The cases are California et al v Trump et al, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 19-16299 and 19-16336; and Sierra Club et al v Trump et al in the same court, Nos. 19-16102 and 19-16300.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's economic activity likely plunged by over one-fifth in April, according to a Reuters poll of analysts, underscoring the economic impact from a nationwide lockdown imposed in mid-March to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South American grains producer is headed for an annual economic contraction estimated at around 10% because of the pandemic, deepening an already two-year recession and hammering families, industry and government income.
""Economic activity hit rock bottom in April. Construction, manufacturing and commerce showed the biggest collapses, but no sector managed to escape the overall crisis,"" said consultancy Orlando Ferreres & Asociados.
The five local and overseas analysts polled by Reuters predicted an average drop of 20.8% for the month, with a median contraction of 21%. Estimates ranged from a minimum monthly fall of 18.8% to a maximum drop of 23%.
""For the next few months, the main concern lies in the closure of companies and the possible permanent reduction of the 'capital stock' that it will entail,"" Argentine consultancy Ecolatina said in a written response to Reuters.
""Likewise, even when the quarantine passes, there will be greater precautionary savings due to the fears it will have caused ... Consequently, the crisis and the collapse of economic activity will extend beyond the lockdown."" 
Argentina's government is expected to extend a lockdown in and around capital city Buenos Aires beyond the end of June, and to tighten rules about movement after a recent spike in cases.

Argentina's official INDEC statistics agency is set to release the official economic activity data on Monday.

800,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2020 12:30PM ET</span>","A quick reopening, a surge in infections, and a U.S. recovery at risk","By Howard Schneider
ROCK HILL, S.C. (Reuters) - When Texas reopened bars for the Memorial Day weekend last month, cooped-up millennials and Gen Zers took full advantage, flouting social distancing rules to pack clubs and pushing their credit card spending in the next two weeks back to 2019 levels.
That brief fling with a more fulsome economic reopening, replicated in southern states like Florida and South Carolina, has boomeranged in a resurgence of novel coronavirus cases that is now changing the nature of the pandemic and likely to test the strength of any broader economic rebound.
The reports of widening outbreaks in places like Florida and Texas have noted that it is now younger adults who are getting infected with COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus. That could temper the death rate since young adults are less likely to die from the disease, but could also upend the country's patchwork economic reopening.
Already fitful, the situation may become murkier as some localities backtrack on reopening plans, stores re-shutter, and Americans sort themselves into those willing to risk more exposure and those still abiding by health guidelines. 
It's a recipe, economists and epidemiologists warn, for a muted recovery that could turn recent good news into little more than a head fake. A recent drop in daily deaths may also prove fleeting. Hospitalizations are increasing in Texas, and health experts warn that the spread of the virus among those at lower risk of serious illness, like young adults, will eventually spill over to those more at risk of serious complications.
""There is an inevitable mixing,"" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. ""You will likely see an uptick in deaths.""
And that dynamic could prove poisonous to any economic recovery. 
""If you add in the risk-tolerant going maskless to indoor parties, then the virus will be prevalent ... and the risk-averse will still be afraid to go back to shopping,"" said James Stock, a Harvard University economics professor. ""Thus, the recession lengthens and maybe deepens.""
Stock, along with other researchers, has proposed ways to balance reopening the economy with measures to control the spread of the virus. Yet there's little sense of national agreement on any sort of system like that, or what happens if COVID-19 begins to spread more uncontrollably.
DIFFERENT TRAJECTORY
Top economists are struggling with what the recent surge in cases might mean. 
Does it show, as Evercore ISI Vice Chairman Krishna Guha recently noted, the fragility of the U.S. market if people are scared to cross state lines? Or, as suggested by St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, are varying judgments about risk and risk management among different people, firms and regions simply how the recovery will proceed to some new balance?
Republican-governed states, particularly in the South, were hesitant to crack down early in the pandemic and were quicker to relax restrictions. They are now seeing record growth in COVID-19 cases, and their residents have been singled out for quarantines imposed by states, including New York, that were hardest hit early in the crisis but have made the most progress in suppressing the virus.
West Virginia Governor Jim Justice, a Republican, has cautioned against travel to Myrtle Beach, after cases in his state were linked to infections at the popular South Carolina resort, and some quick-to-reopen politicians have changed tack. 
Within the course of a week, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, went from just encouraging people to ""stay home"" to issuing an edict on Friday that shut down bars, scaled back restaurants' capacity, and curbed other activities.
Authorities in Florida also announced on Friday that bars in the state must immediately stop serving alcohol on premises.
Speaking to the Florida Chamber of Commerce on Thursday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said if significant numbers of people returned to public life without following health rules, it would put the economy ""on a different kind of trajectory.""
""Even though it won't be everyone at once, people might just throw up their hands, say 'you know what, it is not worth it,'"" Bostic said. ""'I will just do my take-out. I will do Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) instead of going to the movies.'""
SLOWER PHASE
There have been positive surprises. U.S. employment unexpectedly rose in May and retail sales rebounded sharply from a historic collapse.
But that may prove a false dawn if states where activity was rebounding more quickly prove to have given the pandemic a new foothold.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economist Jesse Edgerton has charted a rough correlation between rising visits to restaurants in some states and growth of infections two weeks later.
""Even if we move into a new normal where young people were willing to go out and spend again, there will be a drag from older people staying home - not traveling, not going to restaurants,"" Edgerton said. In addition ""we don't know for sure if the people who are going back out and spending now are going to keep doing that."" 
An Oxford Economics ""recovery tracker"" combining 20 economic, health and social metrics began growing steadily in early April but flattened in June. It may slow further if cases continue growing, said Gregory Daco, Oxford's chief U.S. economist.

""Following a strong first phase of recovery – one in which robust growth data from depressed levels give the false impression of an immediate return to pre-Covid economic dynamism – the economy appears to be entering the slower, second phase,"" Daco wrote in a recent analysis. ""The foundation to this recovery is an improving health outlook. If that measure continues to deteriorate, confidence will follow suit.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank more than 620 points as Abbott issued an executive order rolling back plans to reopen the economy against a backdrop of soaring hospitalizations. Bars must close by 12:00 PM local time Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Friday that the global economic crisis spurred by the coronavirus could ultimately test the Fund's $1 trillion in total resources, ""but we're not there yet.""
Georgieva told a Reuters Newsmaker webcast event that it was now clear that an economic recovery would have to get underway without a medical breakthrough and the virus' presence still widespread throughout the world. IMF member countries were standing by to provide more support to the Fund if necessary, she said.
The IMF on Tuesday forecast a deeper global recession than initially anticipated, as business closures, travel restrictions and social distancing measures persist in most countries. It now anticipates a global GDP contraction of 4.9% this year and a total output loss of $12 trillion through the end of 2021. 
""We still have about three quarters of our lending capacity available,"" Georgieva said. ""I wouldn’t put it beyond us that we might be in a place where the IMF resources are being tested, but we’re not there yet.""
Regarding the possibility of additional resources, she said: ""Our members are telling us, 'Everything is on the table. You come to us if you need to do more of something, we are there for you.'""

804,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 26, 2020 09:54AM ET</span>",Banks on ‘Much Shorter Leash’ With Fed’s New Payout Rules,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest U.S. banks face stricter oversight in the wake of this year’s stress tests, after the Federal Reserve added new rules that could limit dividends and stock buybacks in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
While the industry fared well in the central bank’s annual review, policy makers said Thursday they would require firms to re-submit capital plans later this year, a step they’ve never taken before that again raises the possibility of smaller shareholder payouts.
“Banks will be on a much shorter leash going forward,” Adam Crisafulli, who left JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. last year to found Vital Knowledge Media, wrote in a note. “The industry will essentially be forced to resubmit their capital plans later this year and there will be updates conducted quarterly by the Fed to determine if adjustments are needed.”
Bank shares declined in New York, with  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). down 3.8% and JPMorgan off 3.3%.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co., whose recent earnings slide puts it most squarely in the Fed’s crosshairs for payout cuts, fell 4.1%.
The Fed said late Thursday it was capping dividends at second-quarter levels and would limit future payouts based on a formula linked to recent earnings. Banks can’t increase dividends or end a buyback freeze through at least the third quarter.
“Investor concerns around dividend sustainability are likely to persist,” Richard Ramsden, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said in a note. “Results were in line with expectations, but re-submission creates near-term uncertainty.”
The Fed didn’t say when new capital plans would be required or how they would be judged. Some analysts said the requirement was akin to an entirely new stress test.
“The Fed is reasserting itself in the capital-distribution process after having become more hands-off in recent years,” said Adam Gilbert, regulatory leader of the financial-services advisory practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers. “The new regime was going to allow the banks to do their own decisions on capital, but now we have Covid-19, and the Fed is back.”
Goldman’s Ramsden estimated that Wells Fargo,  Capital One  Financial Corp (NYSE:COF). and Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) would be the most likely to cut dividends under the Fed’s new rule. But if the central bank continues its restrictions beyond the third quarter, more dividends would be at risk as income levels drop.
The Fed added a new “sensitivity analysis” to the review that sought to capture how well firms are prepared to handle financial pressure caused by the pandemic. Those results were released only in aggregate form, showing how all the banks being tested would fare under more severe scenarios.
Policy makers considered three potential scenarios: a quick V-shaped recovery, a slower U-shaped bounce-back and a worst-case W-shaped scenario, which assumes a second wave of coronavirus containment measures. In that review, industry capital levels are expected to slump 4.3 percentage points.
Brainard Dissents
Given the significant declines in capital, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said it was a mistake to let banks keep paying dividends. She said there was a “substantial likelihood” that banks will need larger capital buffers to absorb future losses.
Under the new rule, a bank’s dividend can’t exceed average quarterly earnings for the previous four quarters. That new emphasis on earnings power could be a problem for Wells Fargo, where profits slumped 89% in the first quarter. Unlike many of its rivals, Wells Fargo doesn’t have a sizable trading operation benefiting from market volatility.
Goldman Sachs and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) fared the worst among U.S.-based banks in the regular portion of the stress tests, with their capital levels declining 6.4 and 5.5 percentage points, respectively, under a hypothetical economic crisis devised by the Fed.
Both firms were expected to do worse than other banks because their businesses are more reliant on capital markets, which take a heavier beating in the regulator’s crisis scenario.
The Fed previously asked banks to refrain from making announcements on buybacks and dividends until Monday."

Firms have been reincorporating tens of thousands of workers each day during the past weeks.
The government covers part of employers’ social security contributions for workers who have returned and those who remain temporarily suspended.
The furlough program, known in Spanish as ERTE, “has decisively contributed to stemming what would have been a hemorrhaging in our labor market,” government spokeswoman Maria Jesus Montero said in a press conference on Friday. “Jobs are our priority.”The decision underscores how the economic damage from the coronavirus crisis is deeper than officials in Spain had anticipated when the pandemic struck -- forcing them to prolong a plan that they had expected to last only a few months. Around the world economists continue to slash their forecasts, compelling policy makers to keep doubling down on their emergency measures.
The furlough scheme was already extended once in May and the current iteration was set to expire on June 30. Social Security Minister Jose Luis Escriva and Labor Minister Yolanda Diaz had been intensely negotiating during the past two weeks with union leaders and business associations to reach a deal.
Disagreements over the additional duration and generosity of the scheme had pushed a final agreement to the last minute.
Some industry leaders were calling for an extension through Dec. 30. They ultimately settled on Sept. 30."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A clutch of powerful U.S. Senators is pushing back against a bid by the Trump administration's Treasury Department to weaken a watchdog panel involved with overseeing $2.4 trillion in pandemic aid, according to three congressional aides.
The effort to reinforce the authority of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC) is the latest sign of tension between lawmakers and watchdogs tasked with safeguarding COVID funds on one hand, and on the other, a Trump administration that has resisted calls for full transparency for the taxpayer-funded relief programs.
At issue is a determination by Treasury officials last month that calls into question whether the accountability committee has oversight of a section of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) that includes more than $1 trillion of funds. The act and its overall more than $2 trillion in taxpayer-funded aid was passed in March and designed to keep workers employed and stabilize an economy reeling from the pandemic.
Those mounting a defense of the PRAC panel, which was created by the same CARES legislation, include members of Trump's own party.
Among them, Republican Senator Richard Shelby, who leads the Appropriations Committee which allocates federal funding and has said he would support the PRAC panel.
""American taxpayers have a right to know how their money is being spent. Neither the letter nor the spirit of the law limit the accountability committee's purview in that regard,"" a spokesman for Shelby said.
Several lawmakers and non-profits say the Treasury's interpretation is at odds with Congress' intention that the PRAC panel have oversight of all COVID bailout funds, including those passed in previous and subsequent spending packages. 
A Treasury spokeswoman said the agency is committed to transparency and is complying with the law. 
Senator Gary Peters, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee which was involved in drafting the CARES Act language creating the watchdog, is working on a fix to clarify its full remit, an aide from the committee said. 
Peters said in a statement that he and the Republican chair of the committee, Ron Johnson, had worked for ""strong transparency and accountability measures"" in the CARES Act and that ""strong oversight of these programs prevents waste, fraud and abuse.""
Johnson's office did not respond to requests for comment.
Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee which also helped write CARES, said he would seek to clarify the PRAC's powers when the Republican-led Senate moves on the next stimulus package. The tentative timeline for that is mid to late July. 
""The convoluted Treasury General Counsel legal opinion that attempts to limit the oversight of the (PRAC) can only be read as an effort to evade the transparency and accountability that the American people deserve,"" said Leahy.
The homeland security committee aide said Senate Democrats are also considering language to clarify which inspectors general could serve on the PRAC, after President Donald Trump removed three inspectors general from the committee, including Glenn Fine, the acting Pentagon inspector general who had been appointed as its chair. 
Last month, Treasury's general counsel issued an internal legal analysis concluding that a part of the CARES Act known as ""Division A"" -- with funding that totals more than $1 trillion -- was not subject to data reporting oversight by the PRAC, according to a letter the PRAC sent to lawmakers on June 11.
In the letter, PRAC said that opinion raised ""potentially significant transparency and oversight issues"" because it implied the PRAC may not have any oversight of that section of the act. The section in question includes the Small Business Administration's $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program and Treasury's $500 billion Economic Stabilization Fund. 
A Senate Appropriations Committee source said there was no question Congress intended PRAC to have full oversight and added that Treasury's legal interpretation was too narrow. 

The Treasury says its programs are already subject to scrutiny by Congress and other agencies, and that duplication by the accountability committee would not enhance oversight.

""The bar for companies accessing taxpayers' support in a bespoke and significant way is extraordinarily high and should be extremely rare,"" he said, adding that any such support would come with ""significant strings attached"".

Investing.com -- The U.S. posted a new record high for Covid-19 infections, prompting Texas and Florida to pause their reopenings. ECB President Christine Lagarde said the worst of the pandemic was over in Europe but warned the recovery would be uneven. U.K. markets rose as the country abandoned its plans to quarantine people arriving from abroad. The Fed said banks could face $700 billion of loan losses from the pandemic and told them not to buy back stock for another three months. Stocks are set to open mixed, with the spreading row over Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and its advertisers in focus. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, June 26th.
1. Fed caps bank payouts
The Federal Reserve warned that a prolonged downturn caused by the Coronavirus pandemic could leave the banking sector sitting on $700 billion of losses on bad loans.
Announcing the results of its annual stress test, the Fed said that while banks were well-enough capitalized to absorb such losses, it wanted to ensure they stayed that way.
As a result, it ordered banks not to buy back stock in the third quarter (the banks themselves chose not to buy back stock during the last three months). The Fed also capped the dividends they can pay out at the level of their average quarterly profit over the last four quarters.
Banking stocks fell in after-hours trading and are set to open between 1.2% and 2.7% lower, with  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) – the bank most exposed to the dividend cap as formulated – being the worst hit.
2. Record infections halt reopening
The U.S. posted 37,000 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, a new daily record, as the outbreaks in California, Texas, Florida and Arizona continued to spread.
Texas and Florida put the reopening of their economies on hold in response to the surge in new infections of Covid-19 over the last few days. However, neither state – the second and fourth-largest in the U.S. by population – has tightened restrictions on activity yet.
Texas healthcare CEOs played down reports of local hospitals, notably in Houston, reaching their maximum capacity for intensive care, saying that there are options available to increase it. Governor Greg Abbott mandated hospitals in Harris and three other counties to postpone elective surgery to free up resources. The loss of high-margin elective surgery is increasingly cropping up as a factor hitting hospitals’ financial performance.
Elsewhere, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to strike down the Obama-era Affordable Care Act.
3. Stocks set to open mixed, Facebook, Amazon eyed
U.S. stock markets are set to open mixed and are still on course for a weekly loss amid fears of new restrictions on the economy to contain the virus. White House officials and state governors remain publicly opposed to a new round of lockdowns, however.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 futures contract was down 55 points or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was flat and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.2%.
Stocks in focus later are likely to include Facebook, after Verizon (NYSE:VZ) joined a list of companies intending to boycott its social media networks in protest at its hands-off approach to hate speech and disinformation.  Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) will also be of interest, after agreeing to buy autonomous driving startup Zoox for $1.2 billion.
4. Lagarde says the worst is over
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde told an online conference that the worst of the pandemic is probably over, at least in Europe, which has reported stable infection rates for over a month since starting to lift its lockdown measure in May.
However, she warned that the recovery is likely to be uneven and ‘transformational’, noting that the pandemic could kill off companies whose businesses were already in long-term decline. European governments have generally not discriminated in handing out subsidies to all parts of their economies since March, hence Lagarde’s words imply a warning against pumping endless money into ‘zombie’ companies.
The euro was largely unchanged against the dollar at $1.1227.
The ECB said earlier that eurozone M3 money supply and bank lending grew faster than expected in May, as banks pushed out the ECB’s monetary stimulus into the real economy.
5. U.K. abandons quarantine plan
The U.K. abandoned its plan to impose a 14-day quarantine on visitors arriving from abroad as part of its strategy to tackle the coronavirus epidemic.
The government’s decision came under pressure from the travel industry, which had threatened legal action to stop the plan, which it said would cause thousands of job losses, not least across the tourism sector.
It’s the latest in a series of decisions that have shown the British government tending to relax its pandemic measures with an eye to minimizing the harm to the economy. The OECD and International Monetary Fund both expect the U.K. to be the worst-hit of all G7 economies this year.
The pound pared earlier gains to be flat against the dollar, while the FTSE 100 rose 1.6%, the best performer among major European markets on Friday."

EU leaders agreed in April to build a trillion-euro emergency fund to help the 27-nation bloc rebound from the pandemic, but the final details have yet to be agreed.
""We really need to act quickly now if we want the funds to be available on January 1, 2021,"" Kukies told an online event.
It is not possible to ""sugar-coat"" the severity of the economic crisis being faced by Europe, and things could get worse before they get better, he said.
But there are signs that the crisis is ""bottoming out"" with strong credit expansion in Germany, the EU's largest economy, during the height of the crisis, Kukies added.
Germany will drive the bloc's agenda over the next six months and Kukies said that in financial services there was a need for a harmonised approach to anti-money laundering moves.
""We need a European supervisor for AML,"" Kukies said.
He also wants the EU to move ahead with improving its capital market, such as by digitalising the issuance, trading and settlement of bonds to encourage companies to raise more funds and cut fragmentation in markets.

The May survey by accounting firm Deloitte and German industry association BDI of 248 German companies with interests in Britain found that 25% expected talks to be extended.
About 26% said they expected the two sides to reach a free trade deal by the end of the year and 18% said they believed the EU and Britain will reach a basic framework agreement that will be finalised next year.
Britain and the EU, which remain far apart with only a few months until a deal must be reached, have intensified talks on a trade deal that would replace ties severed by Brexit.

A transition period, during which Britain remains in the EU single market and customs union, expires at the end of the year. A no deal is a scenario feared by many firms as it would translate into high tariffs on products and services and cause major disruptions to the movement of people and goods.

With millions of people in stuck at home and much of the bloc's economy mothballed, activity came to a standstill in March and only started to remerge in May, forcing firms to find emergency cash to survive.
Lending growth to non-financial corporations accelerated to 7.3% in May from 6.6% a month earlier, its best rate since early 2009. Household lending growth meanwhile held steady at 3.0%.
Although banks initially appeared to tighten access to credit, a raft of government and central bank measures, from public guarantees to easier collateral rules, has supported lending.
Indeed, the ECB loaned 1.3 trillion euros to banks last week for at a rate as low at minus 1% provided banks at least maintain their stock of lending to the real economy. 

The annual growth rate of the M3 measure of money supply accelerated to 8.9% from 8.2%, beating expectations for 8.6% in a Reuters poll.

Renold Plc, a Manchester-based maker of vehicle chains and gearboxes, is among them. It’s planning to fast-track deliveries to customers in the coming months to ensure they aren’t caught up in any potential border disruption due to Brexit in January, according to Chief Executive Officer Robert Purcell.
“We’re going to assume it’s going to be difficult,” Purcell said in a phone interview. “You can never count on the way you think it’s going to go.”
Johnson is still optimistic that a deal will be done with the EU, despite months of stumbling trade talks. But even if negotiations do make progress in the weeks ahead -- with extra sessions agreed for July and August -- firms are having to make hard choices now to reduce the risks to their operations.
For manufacturers, this includes rebuilding stockpiles. Luxury automaker Bentley, the U.K.-based unit of Germany’s Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), has doubled its warehousing capacity and is carrying between five and 10 days of parts compared with around two previously, Chief Executive Officer Adrian Hallmark said Tuesday. Bentley imports about 45% of the parts that go into its cars, with 90% of those coming from continental Europe.
“It has cost us millions per year,” he said, referring to the stockpiling expense. “We see a significant hit from a hard Brexit.”
Getting Ready
Fellow carmaker Vauxhall, owned by Groupe PSA, has major U.K. production facilities in Luton and Ellesmere Port and is preparing for both a deal and a no-deal scenario.
It’s preparing to file new customs documentation for when the U.K. leaves the EU’s customs union, according to Helen Foord, the company’s head of government relations. It’s also getting ready to submit extra paperwork to prove so-called rules of origin, showing the eligibility of its cars to receive tariff-free treatment under any potential trade agreement.
Yet the risk of a 10% tariff on the export of cars to the EU from Britain under a no-deal scenario, which is the duty that would apply without a trade accord, means it is postponing a final call on expanding in the U.K.
“It’s no secret that we are due to make an investment at our plant in Ellesmere Port,” Foord said to a parliamentary committee earlier this month. “Until we have the clarity over what Brexit looks like, then we will make a decision.”
Wall Street’s Best-Laid Brexit Plans in Disarray Amid Virus (1)
The U.K. and the EU are hoping to have a trade deal hammered out by October, at the latest, because the bloc needs time to receive necessary approvals from member nations before the Jan. 1 exit date. However, the longer the negotiations go on, the more costs businesses will have to incur to protect themselves from the cliff edge of no deal.
The top concerns for businesses remain tariffs and disruption to the flow of goods crossing the U.K.-EU border. Without a free-trade agreement, Britain and the bloc will default to trade on World Trade Organization terms, which can impose steep levies such as an 8% tariff on chocolate and 30% on orange juice.
At the same time, the government is worried that businesses won’t be ready for the wave of new post-Brexit paperwork, which will lead to trucks being stopped at ports. Earlier this month, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said he was concerned by the lack of preparatory action taken by firms, and the government is planning a “shock and awe” information campaign in the second half of this year to jolt companies into action.
Many companies are still reluctant to conduct any major reorganizations of supply chains to avoid tariffs while there is still hope of a U.K.-EU trade deal, said Stephen Adams, senior director at Global Counsel, which advises firms on their Brexit planning.
“Strategy teams are reluctant to bake into their spreadsheets the worst case scenario,” he said. “That can create a whole cascade of choices that are hard and costly to reverse.”

813,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 08:50PM ET</span>",No breakthrough yet from plodding global recovery outlook: Reuters poll,"By Shrutee Sarkar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The outlook for a global economic recovery over the past month has worsened or at best stayed about the same, according to a firm majority of economists in Reuters polls, with the ongoing recession expected to be deeper than predicted only last month.
World stocks fell to their lowest in over a week on Thursday, as recovery doubts have crept in, driven by a surge in coronavirus cases in many countries. 
That includes the United States, which appeared to have gained some control over the pandemic in May, leading to several states lifting restrictions.
Along with increasing trade tensions, prospects of a second wave of the virus and the latest warning from the International Monetary Fund of a near 5% plunge in the global economy this year has raised fears the V-shaped recovery expected by financial markets is in jeopardy.
Reuters polls of over 250 economists taken this month showed ongoing recessions in most major developed economies would be deeper than predicted last month, leaving unemployment rates well above pre-COVID levels even by the end of next year.
When asked how the global economic recovery outlook had changed over the past month, 80% or 71 of nearly 90 economists said it had worsened or at best stayed the same. 
The remaining respondents said it had improved, despite global gross domestic product forecasts for this year in the wider poll down from a month ago and roughly the same in a worst case scenario.
""We see three kinds of risks going forward. The first is that the virus comes back. That could trigger a reversal of the reopening process. The second risk is monetary and/or fiscal fatigue,"" said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at BofA.
""Governments have been very aggressive in countering the shock. However, monetary policy is now scraping the bottom of the policy barrel. More fiscal stimulus is likely to come in major developed economies, but it could be slower and smaller. The third risk is the second-round shock could be even worse than we assume.""
The world economy was forecast to shrink 3.7% this year and grow 5.4% next year, compared to a contraction of 3.2% and growth of 5.4%, respectively, in the previous poll.
(GRAPHIC - Reuters Poll: How has the outlook for the global economic recovery changed? - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/gjnpwwweqpw/GG%20EQ.PNG)
While that median consensus for this year is less pessimistic than the IMF's projection of -4.9%, in a worst case scenario in the latest poll the global economy was forecast to shrink 6.0%.
""Even with recent bright signs, the initial drop is much deeper than post-2008. While tens of millions of new jobs will likely be created between now and year-end, a quicker jobs recovery is not a V,"" noted Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of macro research at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""We expect global GDP to surpass pre-COVID levels only in late 2021, and later still for advanced economies. And much could still go wrong, especially if the virus has a second wave.""
(GRAPHIC - Reuters poll: Global economic outlook - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/ygdpzwwyxvw/Global%20economic%20outlook.PNG)
At the same time, the world's biggest central banks were not expected to achieve their inflation targets even within three years.
Indeed, if anything, the bigger threat is disinflation or deflation once the pandemic subsides rather than higher prices, according to a separate Reuters survey of economists on the global inflation outlook, run alongside the latest poll.
That raises the question of what options policymakers have left.
""As the COVID-19 crisis has unfolded, talk has turned to 'helicopter money' and 'debt monetization',"" noted David Mackie, economist at JP Morgan.

""In our view, much of this commentary is misconceived, not because of a lack of a legal mandate for central banks to do this, or because of the logistical challenges involved, but rather because it is inconsistent with the way that the modern monetary system works.""

814,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 08:40PM ET</span>",Hong Kong pro-democracy shops fear China's new security law,"By Carol Mang and Yanni Chow
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Daniel Lee says a surge of new customers came to his Hong Kong Reader Bookstore after pro-democracy demonstrations erupted in the Chinese-ruled territory last summer, looking for books on political protest.
Now he fears he will have to take some bestsellers - such as Václav Havel's ""The Power of the Powerless"" and a collection of eye-witness accounts of the Tiananmen Square crackdown of 1989 - off his shelves, as China prepares to introduce new national security legislation for Hong Kong. 
""If one day they identify uncensored books as attempts to subvert state power, we would have little chance of continuing our business,"" Lee told Reuters in the shop he opened 13 years ago.
The new law, designed to prohibit what China calls secession, subversion and external interference in Hong Kong, is set to be passed by China's top legislative body next week, on the eve of the 23rd anniversary of China taking back control of the former British colony.
Beijing has not made public a draft of the legislation, but many in Hong Kong fear it will be used to silence dissent. 
Lee believes his small business and more than 4,500 others identified on activist sites as ""yellow"" - meaning they support the pro-democracy movement and vice-versa - will be targeted. 
He is not alone. 
""They can interpret the law themselves, they can arrest whoever they want, and we are afraid that we will be arrested too,"" said Dave Lee, one of the founders of HK Protect, which sells helmets, respirators and other gear for street protesters. ""If things really go that far, we will either close down or leave.""
Asked about such concerns, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam's office told Reuters in an email that the city's residents will keep their rights and freedoms under the new law: ""The vast majority of Hong Kong people who abide by the law and do not participate in acts or activities that undermine national security will not be affected.""
China's State Council Information Office, its Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the National People's Congress Standing Committee, the body that will pass the new law, did not reply to requests for comment. 
There are signs that yellow businesses are a concern for China. The Hong Kong Liaison Office, Beijing’s top representative office in the city, said in May that such businesses violated free market principles and were ""kidnapping"" the economy for political ends. The Liaison Office did not reply to a request for comment on this story. 
YELLOW CIRCLE
Lee and his bookshop became part of what is known as Hong Kong's 'yellow economic circle' last year by shutting his shop several times as part of city-wide strikes in support of the protests and donating to legal aid funds to help people who were arrested. 
Other businesses have joined the circle by employing activists who have been convicted of protest-related offences, offering shelter to protesters during clashes, or by donating water and snacks for long rallies in the heat. Some businesses are listed as yellow on activist sites for having protest paraphernalia on their walls or for their social media activity.
In return, pro-democracy supporters favour such shops over others. A campaign to support the yellow economy in May gave a shot in the arm to many small businesses battered by the new coronavirus.
Ivan Ng, whose Onestep Printing shop sells protest-themed paintings, posters and flags, said he will wait to see how strictly the law is implemented.
""We may need to stop selling these products, but we don't want to give up immediately,"" said Ng, who estimates he makes 90% of sales to pro-democracy protesters. ""If someone gets arrested – or I am the first one to be arrested – I will give it up."" 
According to Sandra Leung at Wefund.hk, which sells protest-themed artwork, clothing and accessories, some customers may avoid buying products with slogans on them after the law is passed. ""What scares me the most is self-censorship,"" she said.
Other yellow businesses such as the Fong Waa Parlour restaurant, Hair Guys Salon and egg waffle shop Ice Puff told Reuters they may take down protest-related decorations because of the new law.
Cartoonist Cuson Lo said he is worried that publishers may start rejecting his drawings unless he censors himself. Veteran pro-democracy activist Lee Cheuk-Yan said he is working on a website commemorating the Tiananmen Square crackdown in case the brick-and-mortar museum he helped set up is closed.
Last week Herbert Chow, the owner of a Hong Kong children's clothes shop called Chickeeduck, refused a request by his landlord to remove a statue of a protester from one of his stores.

""What I am doing today potentially is going to be treason,"" said Chow, once the law is passed.

815,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 07:20PM ET</span>","UK VAT cut would bring mixed benefits, IFS think-tank says","LONDON (Reuters) - The boost to Britain's economy from a temporary cut in value-added tax (VAT) would be smaller than in 2008, and any reduction needs to be timed carefully, a leading think-tank warned after media reports that a cut is likely next month.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak is due to make a statement on the public finances in July, as Britain lifts coronavirus restrictions and begins to recover from its sharpest economic shock in centuries.
A one-year reduction in the rate of VAT last took place in 2008 to soften the immediate impact of the global financial crisis, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the arguments for doing so again were ""mixed"".
""There is little point introducing a VAT cut if continued fear of the virus, or continued social distancing restrictions, mean that firms are unwilling to cut prices or consumers are simply unwilling to spend,"" IFS researcher Peter Levell said.
Unlike in 2008, businesses' capacity to meet higher consumer demand is limited by coronavirus restrictions, and people's incomes have been boosted by a government job support programme, the IFS said.
Any cut would need to be timed carefully to boost demand only when businesses could cope with it, and risked subsidising a rise in spending that would take place anyway.
""The government is perhaps better off ... waiting to see how quickly consumer spending recovers over the coming weeks as fears of the virus recede before deciding whether and how to implement it,"" the IFS said.
Shops selling non-essential goods reopened on June 15, and pubs and restaurants will be able to restart operations on July 4.
Official data showed a partial rebound in retail sales in May after they collapsed by nearly 20% in April, though many retailers are pessimistic about the chances of a full recovery.
Restricting a VAT cut to the hardest-hit sectors such as hospitality was an option, but would favour richer households who spent more on non-essential services and who were also likely to save money rather than spend it again, the IFS said.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 05:40PM ET</span>",Fed balance sheet down again as currency swaps fall further,"(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's stash of assets shrank for a second straight week as foreign central banks once again sharply cut their use of currency swaps and U.S. banks further dialed back their use of Fed repurchase agreements.
The size of the Fed's balance sheet - composed of assets ranging from U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to loans to banks and state governments - fell to $7.13 trillion on June 24 from $7.14 trillion a week earlier, data released by the Fed showed on Thursday.
Thursday's data also showed the Fed has yet to extend any credit under its Main Street Lending Program, designed to give small and mid-sized businesses a funding backstop during the coronavirus crisis. While the facility's balance rose to $37.5 billion from $31.9 billion a week before, the change entirely reflected additional seed capital from the U.S. Treasury.
As was the case a week earlier, when the Fed's balance sheet shrank for the first time since February, the main culprit in the overall drop was another big reduction in foreign exchange swaps with other central banks as the dollar-funding crunch that had triggered their heavy use starting in March continued to ease.
The balance outstanding fell to just under $275 billion on June 24 from $352.4 billion a week earlier. It was the lowest level since March 25 and is now nearly 40% below its peak usage in late May.
Related data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which executes the swaps, showed the balance on Thursday was lower still at $228.7 billion. The two biggest users of the facilities - the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank - have sharply curtailed their use, allowing a number of 3-month swaps initiated in March to mature without rolling the full balance into new agreements.

The Fed's repo facilities are also seeing far less use. At $70.2 billion outstanding on Wednesday, down from $79.1 billion a week before, it was the lowest since mid-September when the Fed was forced to start injecting cash into the banking system to alleviate funding stress caused by its then-shrinking balance sheet.

817,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 05:36PM ET</span>",India’s Animal Spirits in Deep Slumber Despite Economy Reopening,"(Bloomberg) -- A downturn in business and investment activity in India deepened in May despite parts of the economy exiting the world’s strictest stay-at-home measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
The needle on a dial measuring so-called animal spirits swung to the left last month, reflecting weakness in the majority of eight high-frequency indicators compiled by Bloomberg News. The gauge uses the three-month weighted average to smooth out volatility in single-month readings.
The reading mirrors double-digit declines in a cross-section of indicators from infrastructure output to exports, and supports some of the grim economic forecasts for India. The International Monetary Fund predicts Asia’s third-largest economy to contract 4.5% this year -- it’s first in more than four decades -- compared with an April projection of 1.9% growth. That’s only slightly better than  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s forecast of a 5% decline, while Bloomberg Economics sees a 10.6% plunge.
Here are details of the dashboard:
Business Activity
Activity in India’s dominant services sector showed a mild improvement in May from a month ago, but that’s hardly to be read as a sign of recovery. The main services index rose to 12.6 from a record low of 5.4, while manufacturing was at 30.8. These together weighed on the composite index, which came in at 14.8. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.
Output sank sharply due to extended business shutdowns and very weak demand conditions, according to the IHS Markit survey. It also pointed to a substantial decline in new work orders and price pressures, indicating deflationary trends in both input and output costs for the services sector.
Exports
Exports in May plunged 36.5% from a year ago to $19.1 billion, a slight improvement from a month earlier thanks to a gradual lifting of global lockdowns. Nevertheless, non-oil exports fell 30.1% from a year earlier, while shipments of gems and jewelry along with textiles dropped sharply.
A sharper contraction in imports relative to exports was also indicative of the weak state of the domestic economy, according to economists, including Bloomberg Economics’s Abhishek Gupta.
Consumer Activity
Consumers -- the bedrock of the Indian economy -- kept their purse strings tight amid fear about loss of income and jobs. While ShopperTrac data showed footfalls at retail stores fell nearly 30% in May, a central bank survey pointed to consumer confidence collapsing to a historic low.
Auto sales -- a key sign of demand in the economy -- remained tepid after registering zero sales in April.
Bank credit growth slowed to 5.5% year-on-year from 6.8% in April and 13.5% a year ago, while outstanding bank credit dropped to 102.2 trillion rupees in May from 102.7 trillion rupees in April. That was despite ample liquidity as the central bank kept pumping cash to keep financial conditions accommodative.
Industrial Activity
The Index of Industrial Production fell sharply in April -- the peak of the virus-related lockdown -- when a majority of industrial sectors were shut. Many units that responded to the survey reported no production, the government said, while adding that the numbers weren’t comparable with earlier months.
Meanwhile, India’s infrastructure industries output shrank by a record 38.1% in April from a year ago. The sectors, which make up 40% of the industrial production index, had contracted by 9% in March. Both data are published with a one-month lag.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Appearing before U.S. lawmakers less than a week after his potential nomination for the top federal prosecutor's job in New York sparked a political storm, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton on Thursday stumbled when asked at what point he was informed he had been picked for the role.
Clayton, who has come under severe criticism from Democrats for becoming embroiled in the removal of Geoffrey Berman as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, initially said ""last weekend"" in reference to June 19, before later correcting himself to say it was a week before.
""It was the weekend of June 12 and was entirely my idea. This is something I had been thinking about for several months as a possible continuation of public service,"" Clayton said in a hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee.
The hearing came after Attorney General William Barr announced https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sec-analysis/ousting-of-u-s-prosecutor-thrusts-low-profile-markets-regulator-into-unwelcome-spotlight-idUSKBN23R0S1 on Friday that Berman was stepping down and would be replaced by Clayton.
Berman's office, which is known for prosecuting the most high-profile terrorism cases, Wall Street financial crimes and government corruption, has not shied from taking on figures in President Donald Trump’s orbit.
Only after Barr backtracked from his plan to handpick Berman's temporary replacement, allowing Deputy U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss to take the reins, did Berman agree to step down on Saturday.
In an email earlier this week to his staff, Clayton said he had pursued the New York prosecutor's job because he had a ""strong desire to continue in public service"" while returning to the city where his family is based.
Republican lawmakers on Thursday praised Clayton, one of the Trump administration's more low-profile officials, for his ""integrity"" in his current role. Some wished him well in potential future positions.
But the saga has sparked concerns among Democrats of possible White House interference at the SEC.
""I am deeply concerned that while your nomination to this important post is pending, President Trump and Attorney General Barr may try to interfere with your ability to independently and effectively oversee the Securities and Exchange Commission,"" ,"" said Representative Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT), the Democratic chairwoman of the House committee.
Clayton told lawmakers he would seek to maintain his independence from carrying out any political favors while in his current role. He said he would not comment on any details regarding his potential nomination.
In the meantime, he also said he is fully committed to serving as SEC chairman.

""Whether in my current position or in any other position, I commit to doing it independently,"" Clayton said.

(Reuters) - The possibility of a surge in COVID-19 infections is likely to remain a threat to the U.S. economy until a vaccine is developed, and a full recovery is still far off, Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George said Thursday.
The shutdowns enacted to control the virus disproportionately hit hospitality, education, health and retail, and it will take a while for the economy to recover fully, George said in remarks prepared for a virtual event organized by the Economic Club of Kansas City. 
""While we saw strong job gains in these industries in May, with employment increasing by 2 million jobs, a full recovery is still far off,"" she said. 
The Fed's efforts to boost market liquidity and improve market functioning through asset purchases and a slate of emergency lending facilities seem to have worked, George said. But economic activity may not fully rebound, and the possibility of a new surge of infections is likely to remain a ""persistent risk"" until a vaccine is developed, she cautioned.
State and local governments, in particular, are struggling to balance their budgets after the pandemic led to a sharp drop in tax revenues, she said.

824,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 01:55PM ET</span>","U.S. watchdog finds flaws in virus testing data, chews out Transport Dept, SBA","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. government watchdog gave a blunt review of the shortcomings in the government's response to the pandemic on Thursday that included the sending of nearly $1.4 billion to deceased Americans, and the collection of incomplete and inconsistent virus-testing data.
The report issued by the Government Accountability Office marked the first review of the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic, and made recommendations to lawmakers how to improve the fight to come out of the crisis.
The watchdog noted amongst other shortfalls that the U.S. government had sent nearly $1.4 billion worth of stimulus checks to dead Americans as of the end of April, underlining challenges the government faces in ensuring funds are properly spent.
""The number of economic impact payments going to decedents highlights the importance of consistently using key safeguards in providing government assistance to individuals,"" the watchdog said.
Some of its harshest criticism was reserved for the Small Business Administration (SBA), which oversees a $670 billion emergency loan program to help companies survive the pandemic, and the lack of a plan from the Department of Transportation to improve the aviation sector's response to outbreaks.
Detailing its findings on the coronavirus testing data, the GAO said the data that was collected at times included antibody tests that detect prior infections, and sometimes included counts on the number of samples tested, which could include multiple tests for one person.
""The absence of complete and consistent COVID-19 testing data reported through May 31, 2020, has made it more difficult to track and know the infection rate, mitigate the effect of infections, and inform decisions on reopening communities,"" the watchdog said.
It said the United States is also missing a national aviation-preparedness plan for infectious diseases.
""While the Department of Transportation agreed that a plan is needed, as of May 2020, no such plan had been developed,"" the watchdog said. It said the Transportation Department has maintained that other U.S. agencies should take the lead in planning for outbreaks.
As part of its recommendations to U.S. lawmakers, the watchdog said it is urging them to take legislative action to require the Transportation Department to work with others to develop a national plan.
It criticized the SBA for failing to give detailed descriptions of loans made in its data, and not outlining plans to review loans worth less than $2 million. 
""We encountered the most difficulty trying to obtain information from the Small Business Administration (SBA),"" said the watchdog,. ""SBA to date has failed to provide information critical to our review.""
The SBA did not respond to a request for comment. 
The level of transparency around U.S. government spending to fight the pandemic has been a contentious issue between various watchdogs and government agencies.
According to the watchdog, the U.S. government has set aside $2.6 trillion worth of spending to fight the pandemic, but spending so far is unknown as all agencies are not required to report their expenditures until July 2020.
Some U.S. lawmakers responded to the report on Thursday by calling for greater transparency over how stimulus funds are being spent.
""GAO found that more than $1 trillion in taxpayer funds have already been obligated with little transparency into how that money is being spent,"" U.S. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney said in a statement. 

""The American people deserve to know whether those funds are being misused.""

825,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>",Calls to defund police on collision course with U.S. city budget gaps,"By Karen Pierog
CHICAGO (Reuters) - A movement in the United States to defund local police departments, sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, is colliding with a grim budget reality facing cities. 
After weeks of protests over police treatment of minorities, some cities are considering redirecting a portion of the money they spend on police to mental health, housing and other social services that proponents of the defunding movement say will help prevent crime.
Calls to defund the police come as the coronavirus outbreak has wreaked economic havoc on cities across the United States and punched holes in their budgets, with the National League of Cities projecting a three-year revenue loss of $360 billion. As a result, there is a lot less money to go around for everything. 
Floyd died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes while detaining him on May 25. His death triggered worldwide protests against racism and police brutality.
Michael Belsky, executive director of the Center for Municipal Finance at the University of Chicago, said personnel costs make up 70% to 80% of most city budgets and that 60% of that usually is for public safety. 
He said unless cities get an influx of federal dollars to replace lost revenue, a move that remains uncertain in the U.S. Congress, budget cuts, even to programs that would benefit from a redirection of police resources, will happen. 
""If you don't get some revenue replacement, the flexibility to do any of this is really hampered,"" Belsky said, noting that ""you still need public safety.""
Supporters of the defund movement recognize that social services are more likely candidates for cuts during tough budget times than police, which have typically been immune to reductions even during economic downturns, according to Rashawn Ray, David M. Rubenstein Fellow at the Brookings Institution. 
""I think they would say ... 'Instead, reallocate funding away from police to the social services that are needed badly,'"" he said, adding that police budgets can be shrunk by reducing officer tasks like paperwork and responses to non-emergency calls. 
SPENDING CUTS AHEAD 
As revenue drops and expenses spike, local governments and states will have to cut spending by 5% to 7%, which will produce a drag on the U.S. economic recovery, according to a recent Oxford Economics report. 
New York City, once the U.S. epicenter of the virus outbreak, is projected to lose at least $9 billion in revenue. With a June 30 budget deadline looming, there are several proposals to reduce the police operating budget, which totaled $5.6 billion in fiscal 2020, and redirect the money elsewhere.
In San Francisco, which faces a projected $1.5 billion shortfall in its upcoming two-year budget, Mayor London Breed announced a plan earlier this month to move money from the police department to support the city's African-American community. 
Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan on Tuesday called for $69 million in budget cuts for city departments, with the largest earmarked for police at about $20 million, as part of a plan to plug a budget gap and cover increased virus-related expenses.
Lori Lightfoot, the mayor of Chicago, which is staring down a $700 million shortfall, has resisted calls for defunding, saying that residents want more police protection. 

There were about 468,000 full-time sworn officers in local police departments in 2016, according to U.S. Justice Department data released in October.

826,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 12:17PM ET</span>",India's auto and pharma sectors not ready to wean off China,"By Aditi Shah, Neha Arora and Zeba Siddiqui
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Days after a border clash with China this month in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed, New Delhi told firms to find ways to cut imports from China. But two big industries, automobiles and pharmaceuticals, say this is easier said than done.
Like many countries, India relies on China for products such as electronic components and drug ingredients because it cannot make them or source them elsewhere as cheaply, company and industry figures say.
Thus any moves to curb imports or make them costlier without developing alternatives will hurt local businesses.
""We don't import because we like to, but because we have no choice,"" said R.C. Bhargava, chairman of  Maruti Suzuki India  Ltd (NS:MRTI), the country's biggest carmaker.
""To attract companies to produce locally, we need to be more competitive and lower our costs compared with other countries.""
India imported around $70.3 billion of goods from China in the fiscal year to March 2019, and exported just $16.7 billion - its widest trade deficit with any country. 
The government is now consulting with companies on tightening curbs on 1,173 non-essential products, a trade body official said on condition of anonymity. They include toys, plastics, steel items, electronics and specific auto components - which feed vehicle manufacturing.
This is on top of plans to raise trade barriers and import duties on around 300 products from China and elsewhere, as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's self-reliance campaign.
In April, India also tightened rules for investments from neighbouring countries, including China, to prevent opportunistic takeovers after the pandemic. 
""If things do escalate, then India stands to lose a lot more than China,"" said the chief of corporate strategy at one of India's top 10 drugmakers. ""We cannot afford this.""
""NO KNEE-JERK REACTION""
Over a quarter of India's auto part imports - $4.2 billion - came from China in 2019, including engine and transmission parts, according to data from the Auto Component Manufacturers' Association of India (ACMA).
Some of these components are critical and hard to source elsewhere immediately, said Vinnie Mehta, director general at ACMA, whose members include companies such as  Bosch  (NS:BOSH),  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and Minda Industries (NS:MNDA). 
""We cannot have a knee-jerk reaction, especially when we are emerging from the disruption caused by the pandemic,"" he said.
Chinese supplies have also been a key factor in India's booming drug industry, which exports cheap generic medicines. 
Some of India's largest drug companies, such as Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (NS:SUN),  Lupin  (NS:LUPN) and IPCA Labs (NS:IPCA), rely on China, and India overall gets about 70% of its supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) from there, industry officials said.
""In the immediate future, we are going to continue to be reliant on China,"" said Sudarshan Jain, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, which represents major drug makers, although he believed there was only ""a very low likelihood"" of API supplies being cut off.
However, this still leaves manufacturers dependent on low Chinese prices to be able to meet price controls on the home market and stay competitive abroad.
This month, China increased prices of the common pain reliever paracetamol and of ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic used to fight respiratory infections, by 25%-27%, one senior industry executive said.

""This is an important antibacterial drug. If we don't buy from the Chinese, there will be shortages,"" the executive said. ""Ramping up capacity in India is a gradual, long-drawn process.""

(Reuters) - If April was the month Americans hunkered down at home to fight the coronavirus pandemic, June may prove the month they officially lost patience, venturing back to restaurants, beauty salons and other socially dense activities that hinted at an economic rebound but may also be contributing to a new viral surge.
Data from cellphones, time clocks, and top economic forecasters all pointed toward a steady rebound in economic activity last week, and one that began to include sectors initially left out as too risky because of the proximity among customers and staff and the patchy enforcement of mask-wearing and other safety measures.
GRAPHIC: The ""social sector"" sees life inline - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/xlbpgoogopq/eikon.png
Cellphone data from Unacast showed restaurants at nearly half of U.S states passed 2019 levels of activity last week, with beauty salons and, to a lesser degree, gyms and wellness centers also showing improvement.
Nationally, data from Unacast and Safegraph both showed foot traffic at retail locations continuing to climb toward pre-shutdown or year-ago levels. A retail scorecard maintained by Unacast showed 23 states where visits to retail stores overall were above 2019 levels.
While not indicative of sales, those measures mesh with higher levels of credit card spending reported by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and with a recent surprise jump in retail consumption - possible evidence that stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits were for now having their intended impact.
GRAPHIC: The U.S. reopening inline - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/yxmvjoxakpr/eikon.png 
Time management firms Homebase and Kronos, covering a sample of small businesses and a swath of firms across industries, both pointed to more employees on the job.
Broader metrics from the New York Fed, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Oxford Economics also showed the economy continuing to recover, though Oxford's ""recovery tracker"" suggested caution.
The index combines a variety of economic, social and health measures into a single metric, and suggested the recovery may be at a plateau -- with coronavirus cases reaching a record in states like Texas that had been seeing a quicker rebound.
Joblessness remains perhaps the prime concern. Another 1.48 million people filed for unemployment insurance last week, and nearly 20 million remain on benefit rolls.

829,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 11:50AM ET</span>",Rainy day hastens sovereign wealth funds' refocus to home,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Famed for snapping up glitzy real estate and stakes in troubled international banks during the global financial crisis, sovereign wealth funds are investing more at home, a trend set to accelerate in the wake of the economic carnage wrought by COVID-19.
Some of these state-owned entities, such as Singapore's Temasek Holdings, already acted more as development funds aimed at supporting their countries' economies, but many of them are considered ""rainy day"" funds - meaning they will have a big role in helping governments to manage the fallout from the pandemic.
There has been a flurry of recent domestic deals, such as Turkey's fund injecting 21 billion lira ($3.1 billion) into three state banks and Temasek supporting a $1.5 billion rights issue by Sembcorp Marine.
That's in addition to withdrawals from the Nigerian and Norwegian funds to help their governments deal with the economic impact of the virus.
While the lion's share of sovereign fund investments is still overseas, domestic deals are on the rise. They accounted for 21% of private equity deals in 2019 - already a doubling from 2015 levels, according to the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF).
GRAPHIC: Sovereign wealth fund direct investments - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprrrolpe/swf.png 
""I'd expect greater levels of investment in domestic economies going forward,"" said Will Jackson-Moore, global private equity, real assets and sovereign funds leader, PwC. 
""That said, the best opportunities in international markets are going to be in the next 18 months. If there's demand for short-term emergency funding (from governments) then that could be more of a conflict and it will come down to how governments and sovereign wealth funds balance that.""
Analysts say returns at home may not necessarily be poorer, particularly if funds can cherry pick deals. Also, many are located in emerging markets, where expected gains can be larger. The rub comes if their remit also includes aiding the development of local economies, in which case some of the payback can flow to the economy as well as the fund.
Qatar made its name more than a decade ago in the aftermath of the global financial crisis when its sovereign fund vehicles snapped up stakes in  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) at a time when illiquidity meant many asset prices were low.
This year, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), which manages over $300 billion in assets, is making similar waves, last month disclosing stakes in  Boeing Co  (N:BA),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and Marriott.
Still, the PIF is redoubling its domestic focus, said a source familiar with the fund. Its aim is to ensure its portfolio of local assets under management sits at 75% by the end of 2020. PIF did not respond to a request about its current weighting. 
It's a not dissimilar story for other funds. 
""Many sovereign wealth funds will support national budgets to finance the recovery or support healthcare systems,"" said Javier Capape, director of sovereign wealth research at the IE Center for the Governance of Change, pointing to the examples of the sovereign funds of Iran, Kuwait and PIF.
Ireland's fund formed a rescue package for small and medium-sized enterprises, while Temasek has helped accelerate the production of a vaccine. Abu Dhabi's Mubadala was set to play a key role in propping up neighbouring Dubai's economy by linking up assets in the two emirates, sources said last month.
Mubadala declined comment at the time.
RAINY DAY
While the financial pain caused by the virus is undoubtedly the rainy day sovereign funds have been built for, governments are having to weigh their use of resources now against the prospect of providing windfalls for future generations. That dilemma is especially stark in the case of oil wealth funds as hydrocarbon revenues are expected to wane in future years.
Even before the coronavirus and the plunge in oil prices, drawdowns from Kuwait's General Reserve Fund, managed by the country's sovereign fund, meant its assets are estimated by Fitch Ratings to have fallen for the sixth year in a row.
The Kuwait Investment Authority didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Hong Kong Monetary Authority, not an oil-based fund, will raise the liquidity of its portfolio to ensure it can provide funds for maintaining Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability, while meeting the government's needs in withdrawing fiscal reserve deposits to deal with the epidemic, a spokesperson said.
A recent IFSWF survey of oil and non-oil sovereign funds found only two out of 10 said their governments had sought funds, with the same number saying they had received requests to support additional government projects.
Instead of tapping their rainy day funds, several governments including Gulf states and Kazakhstan have tapped debt capital markets to cover budget shortfalls. Mubadala last month raised $4 billion in bonds.
""It is interesting the use of leverage to finance the buying spree, it makes sense that sovereign wealth funds prefer to go to the debt markets than withdrawing private equity valuable positions at a loss nowadays,"" said Capape.

830,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",EU is 'very concerned' by delayed WTO decision on tariffs vs U.S.,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A delay to a decision on whether the European Union can impose tariffs against the United States over subsidies for Boeing (N:BA) is unjustified and harms the bloc's right to retaliate, the European Commission said on Thursday.
The World Trade Organization has pushed back the decision, originally expected in May or June, to at least September due to the impact that recent coronavirus lockdowns are having on its work, people familiar with the case told Reuters on Wednesday.
""The EU is very concerned about this and we have communicated this to the WTO,"" a Commission spokesman said.
""We believe that the delay would not be justified, even in the context of COVID-19 and that it would be detrimental to the EU's retaliatory rights under WTO rules,"" he continued.    
The United States already won the right last October to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU goods in a related case over subsidies for European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR).
The European Union says it wants to reach an agreement with Washington over plane subsidies to set aside the dispute. However, observers do not believe that will happen until the WTO awards the EU the right to impose tariffs.
The U.S. tariffs target planes, olives, tools and whisky from Airbus-producing countries Britain, France, Germany and Spain and cheese, wine and pork from across the bloc.

It increased the tariff rates in February and is now looking at an additional list of $3.1 billion worth of products such as bakery goods, beer, gin and vodka from the four countries that it could impose duties on next.

Britain and the EU have intensified talks to find a trade deal that will replace the ties severed by Brexit, but with only a few months until a deal needs to be reached, the two sides remain far apart. A transition arrangement expires at the end of the year.
The next round of talks begins on Monday and will be held face to face for the first time since the coronavirus epidemic. Frost said they would be focused on whether ""genuine and rapid progress"" could be made.
""The government will not agree to ideas like the one currently circulating giving the EU a new right to retaliate with tariffs if we chose to make laws suiting our interests,"" he tweeted.
""We could not leave ourselves open to such unforeseeable economic risk.""
Brussels has in recent days floated the possibility that existing regulations on state aid could be used as the benchmark for future common standards.
That idea has been interpreted by some as a signal that if Britain deviated from those standards, the EU could retaliate with tariffs, although an EU official dealing with Brexit dismissed the idea of such tariffs.

833,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>",Central banks have thrown many tools at coronavirus. What do they have left?,"By Dhara Ranasinghe and Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - To kick-start a world economy devastated by coronavirus, central banks have delved deep into their toolboxes and unleashed trillions of dollars in stimulus. So what instruments do they have left, should they need to do more?
Imminent pressure has eased after central banks in the United States, euro zone, UK, China and Japan flung around $5 billion at the problem. But the debate on future policy options remains prescient.
""This was the kitchen sink thrown left, right and centre from central banks across the globe. But what's next is super relevant because clearly there is a limit to how much markets can rise without a more structural, longer lasting recovery path in the economy,"" said Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, chief investment officer at  NN  (NASDAQ:NNBR) Investment Partners.
Another ""big moment"" could soon test policymakers' ability to do more, he predicted.
Here are some tools at their disposal:
1. QE AD NAUSEAM
Quantitative easing, first adopted in many countries during the 2008-9 crisis, is bigger and bolder than ever before.
The Federal Reserve could expand its balance sheet to $10 trillion by the end of 2021, from $7 trillion now, a Reuters poll found. The European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan may further expand QE too, while more emerging markets could embark on it.
And after the Fed broke the taboo of buying junk-rated corporate bonds, could central banks add equities or emulate the Fed's high-street lending schemes? New Zealand's central bank is even looking at adding foreign asset purchases to its list of ""deployable"" tools.
Graphic: Reuters Poll: U.S. economy, jobless rate, Fed balance sheet - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/xegpbmkynvq/U.S.%20economy%20and%20balance%20sheet.PNG
2. CONTROL THAT CURVE
In 2016, the BOJ committed itself to pegging 10-year government bond yields around 0%. In March, as coronavirus panic gripped markets, Australia set a target around 0.25% for three-year yields.
Used by the Fed during World War II, yield curve control can complement QE in holding down borrowing costs as governments issue more debt. The Fed will likely re-engage that strategy, said 70% of investors surveyed by Russell Investments.
Doubters within the Fed point out that it has yet to prove itself in boosting inflation. It may be more palatable however, than cutting rates below 0%.
Graphic: Yield curve control - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkplxwrzpb/ycc.png
3. NIRP TO ZIRP
With interest rates in several countries, including the United States and Britain, at or near 0%, negative rates may seem the logical next step.
New Zealand has flagged that shift, instructing banks to be ready for it by year-end. Sweden, which recently ended five years of negative rates, says going back would be a ""big step"" but not an ""impossible"" one. 
The Fed and BOE have pushed back against going sub-zero, and Chinese officials too oppose it. And negative rates haven't exactly boosted growth or inflation in Europe or Japan. But don't rule it out yet.
Graphic: Major central bank policy rates - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjpqejxmpx/Pasted%20image%201593072596707.png
4. HEY BIG LENDER 
The ECB's targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) programme currently gives banks cash at rates as low as minus 1%, versus the official minus 0.5%. Last week, the scheme saw banks borrow a record 1.31 trillion euros.
Central banks opposing negative policy rates could adopt this targeted lending route, Sarah Hewin, chief Europe economist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), said, adding: ""So you could go for the bank rate minus 50 bps as a way to stimulate lending. Potentially the Fed might go down that way.""
Graphic: ECB Long-Term Refinancing Operations - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgporblkvd/ecbTLTRO2406.PNG
5. HELICOPTERS
For central banks that already print money to buy assets, so-called helicopter drops could follow -- directly funding state spending with newly created money that's not offset by government IOUs, or even by feeding cash direct to households. 
Such options remain taboo to some extent but policymakers have come mighty close to them during the latest shock. The idea isn't new; it was coined back in the 1960s by Milton Friedman as an option to battle deflation, and sounds like a plausible option given stubbornly low inflation.
Then there's the middle ground of modern monetary theory which some say we are already unofficially experiencing. Proponents posit governments should just spend on healthcare, education or infrastructure without worrying about debt levels, as long as low inflation allows central banks to keep borrowing costs low.
""Currently the linkage between the fiscal and monetary side is not explicit,"" said Guy Miller, chief market strategist at Zurich Insurance Group (OTC:ZFSVF). ""(But) this is the direction we are moving in.""

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina is still working with its creditors to reach a debt restructuring deal after talks stalled, though there is still distance to cover in economic and legal terms, Economy Minister Martin Guzman said on Thursday. 
Guzman said the government is in negotiations with two main creditor groups, though the ""biggest differences"" remain with the Ad Hoc Bondholder Group, which includes AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB), BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Ashmore and others. 
""It takes a lot of dialogue, we remain hopeful that it will be able to in some point reach an agreement, but clearly there is more work to do and there is a distance to cover in economic terms and in legal terms as well,"" Guzman said at the webinar, hosted by Bloomberg. 
Argentina last week extended a deadline for $65 billion debt restructuring talks to July 24 after negotiations with creditors reached an impasse. Creditor groups want Argentina to improve its offer, but the government has said it cannot cede ground after raising its proposal to around 50 cents on the dollar, plus an additional export-linked sweetener.
Guzman said ongoing talks with the Argentina Creditor Committee had been constructive, though issues remained to be resolved with the Ad-Hoc bondholders group, specifically around collective action clauses. 
""One of the proposals we received asked Argentina to go back in time and undo the progress that has been done over the last few years, the enhanced collective action clauses endorsed by ICMA (International Capital Markets Association), the G20 and the IMF (International Monetary Fund), and that is not something that Argentina can do,"" Guzman said. 

A deal with creditors is key for avoiding a messy standoff with Argentina, which in May defaulted for a ninth time.

835,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>","Hitting back at German court challenge, ECB defends bond buys","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymakers, fending off a German court challenge to their money-printing scheme, insist that bond buys help prop up the economy and their benefits outweigh the side effects, minutes of their June 4 meeting showed on Thursday. 
Germany's Constitutional Court ruled last month that the ECB overstepped its mandate with over 2 trillion euros ($2.24 trillion) of government bond purchases. The court ordered the Bundesbank to quit the scheme unless the ECB can prove it is needed within three months.
In an indirect response to the ruling, ECB rate-setters said at their latest meeting that a volume of evidence had been amassed to prove that bond buys are a necessity at the moment, crediting them with keeping borrowing costs down while the European Union recovered from its recent debt crisis.
""There was broad agreement among members that while different weights might be attached to the benefits and side effects of asset purchases, the negative side effects had so far been clearly outweighed by the positive effects of asset purchases on the economy in the pursuit of price stability,"" the ECB said in its minutes of the meeting seen by Reuters.
The ECB agreed on Wednesday to give documents to German authorities to prove the proportionality of its bond purchases but the ECB will not directly engage in the process, leaving the Bundesbank to spearhead the process.
In parallel, the ECB has been drawing up contingency plans to carry out its multi-trillion-euro bond-buying programme without the Bundesbank and launch an unprecedented legal action against the German central bank.
Still, ECB policymakers acknowledged the risks and side effects of low rates, including the drain on savings and drag on bank earnings. They also noted that high government debt could pressure the ECB to keep rates low since higher borrowing costs could quickly raise debt sustainability concerns. 
But these risks could be mitigated by self-imposed limits on the bond purchases, such as national quotas determined by how much capital each country paid into ECB coffers, the rate-setters argued at their June 4 meeting.
""Using the ECB’s capital key as the benchmark was one of the safeguards helping to maintain incentives for sound fiscal policies,"" the ECB said in its minutes.
Facing the biggest European economic contraction in generations, policymakers at the June 4 meeting extended emergency bond purchases until mid-2021 and increased them by 600 billion euros to 1.35 trillion euros to help member state governments finance their crisis response.
While there was broad agreement on the package, the minutes showed some disagreement over both the timing and the size of the increase.
Reuters reported after the meeting that policymakers had debated increases of between 500 billion and 750 billion euros.

836,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 08:40AM ET</span>",IMF warns markets at risk of correction after run-up,"By Megan Davies
(Reuters) - Markets for stocks and other risky assets could suffer a second swoon if the coronavirus spreads more widely, lockdowns are reimposed or trade tensions surge again, the International Monetary Fund warned on Thursday.
Equity markets tailspinned into bear market territory in record time earlier this year as the virus and related lockdowns pounded sentiment, but they have broadly rallied from their March 23 low.
The S&P, which fell 34% in just 23 trading days, has been boosted by central bank support, and is now roughly 10% off its record high. Stocks were, however, rocked on Wednesday as infections spiked in a number of U.S. states.
""A disconnect between financial market optimism and the evolution of the global economy has emerged,"" said the IMF in its Global Financial Stability Update. The disconnect ""raises the risk of another correction in risk asset prices,"" the IMF said, adding that valuations across many equity and corporate bond markets appear ""stretched."" 
The warning came just a day after the IMF slashed its 2020 global economic forecasts further.
A correction could be prompted by a deeper and longer recession than currently anticipated, a second wave of the virus, reinstated containment methods or a resurgence of trade tensions, the IMF said.
A broadening of global social unrest in response to rising economic inequality could also damage investor sentiment, the IMF said.
""Bear market rallies have occurred before, during periods of significant economic pressure, often only to unwind subsequently,"" it said.
The IMF also pointed to risks from aggregate corporate debt at historically high levels relative to GDP and increased household debt. 
""This means that there are now many economies with high levels of debt that are expected to face an extremely sharp economic slowdown,"" the IMF said. 

While banks entered the crisis with higher liquidity and capital buffers, insolvencies will test the resilience of the sector, the IMF said.

837,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 08:09AM ET</span>",Unrest Is Changing the Way Americans Spend Money,"(Bloomberg) -- The back-to-back shocks of a deadly virus, lockdowns and civil unrest have a growing number of Americans reevaluating not just their life priorities, but also how — or even, if — they’ll spend their money.
Good.Must.Grow, a Los Angeles-based firm, said its Conscious Consumer Spending Index, which tracks expected purchases of socially responsible brands, suddenly rebounded after trending down since 2017, jumping 15% in May from the previous study in November. Asked what criteria would influence their post-pandemic spending, almost 70% of respondents cited a company’s ability to make a positive impact on society and the environment. The firm polled more than 1,000 Americans. 
“The environmental crisis has become better understood by more people in recent years,” said the consultancy’s founder, Heath Shackleford. “You layer on what’s happening with Covid, with George Floyd and all these things — I think we’re going to see a bigger piece of the economy taken up by companies that are purpose-driven.”
In another survey this month of 1,000 young Americans, marketing research firm Morning Consult reported that two-thirds of people between the ages of 13 and 23 would base future buying decisions on how businesses respond to social issues such as Black Lives Matter. Adults responding to the poll rated that movement, along with the coronavirus, as the two most-impactful events of their lives, surpassing even the election of President Donald Trump.

Molly Graham (NYSE:GHM), a 20-year-old Rhodes College junior studying to become a teacher, said she’s directing what little money she’s spending to local stores where she’s adding to books featuring people of color for her future classroom library. Beyond that, she said, “I’ve kind of put a halt on buying.”
These kinds of shifts already are affecting consumer spending, which accounts for almost 70% of the U.S. economy, although hard data tracking behavior changes are only now starting to trickle out.
But early studies show a clear impact on consumers, and anecdotes back this up. For example, Ricky Steele, a 67-year-old Atlanta technology executive, said he’s never made a conscious decision to boycott a restaurant until now. But after a Fifties-style local diner hung a cryptic banner that appeared to criticize the Black Lives Matter movement earlier this month, Steele publicly vowed to take his cash elsewhere. He estimates he’s spent more than $200,000 over the years at the restaurant and said dozens of his social-media contacts — the majority of them White — indicated they’ll join the boycott.
“Spending power has power, and we don’t always appreciate it,” said attorney Yendelela Neely Holston, who also pledged to spurn the popular Atlanta eatery and instead seek out Black-owned businesses.
Some of them, such as ShearShare in McKinney, Texas, are seeing a surge in customers past pre-Covid-19 levels since states began reopening. Revenue generated by the beauty-tech app, which allows hairstylists and other industry professionals to book spaces in salons, jumped 76% this month from a year ago, according to founders Courtney and Tye Caldwell.
“I think that Covid-19 ushered in that change, unbeknownst to any of us,” Courtney Caldwell said. 
Frank Warren, the Black owner of Brooklyn’s Breukelen Coffee House, agrees: “We’ve all been forced to live simply, so it gives us lots of time to think.” Sales jumped 30% the week following the Floyd protests, he said. 
Last month’s Conscious Consumer Spending Index also found that almost half of respondents said they plan to work harder on their health going forward. That trend, combined with growing interest in socially conscious enterprises, is steering new customers to businesses including White Oak Pastures in Bluffton, Georgia, which raises grass-fed livestock and grows organic vegetables.
The vast majority of its $20 million in annual revenue historically has come from wholesalers such as  Sysco Corp  (NYSE:SYY). and retailers like Whole Foods Market, but during the coronavirus lockdown, online consumer orders soared sixfold, owner Will Harris said.
Most of that increase was due to people replacing grocery-store visits with e-commerce, he said. Even so, he expects the online-consumer business to roughly double from its pre-pandemic level of about $2.5 million a year. Almost a third of White Oak’s new customers placed a second order after states reopened, according to Jenni Harris, his daughter and the farm’s marketing director.
“We’re not the cheapest, quickest place out there,” she said. So along with enjoying the products they bought while sheltering in place, the new customers likely “have an interest in animal welfare, land regeneration or rural economics.”
Early data and consumer polling also show that more Americans are less inclined to part with their dollars. While the U.S. savings rate hit an all-time high of 33% in April thanks mostly to Covid-19-induced business closures, some of that frugality seems to be persisting. A June survey of 876 Americans by Acupoll Precision Research found that almost half of even affluent households had cut back on nonessential spending.
Carol Stanford, a longtime San Diego-area Realtor, falls into that category. She’d always been an “avid shopper” in the past, she said, often meeting friends for lunch and then spending the afternoon at favorite stores such as Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) and Bloomingdale’s. But while sheltering in place, she had “a complete change of outlook” about shopping and invited a friend over to help clean out her closet and donate numerous items to charity.

The account of the Governing Council’s June 3-4 teleconference showed that Chief Economist Philip Lane argued that both an older and more recent asset-purchase programs “were proportionate measures under the current conditions for pursuing the price stability objective, with sufficient safeguards having been built into the design of these programs to limit potential adverse side effects.”

839,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 07:50AM ET</span>","Spanish economy may have shrunk near 20% in second quarter, says central bank","MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's coronavirus-battered economy may have shrunk close to 20% in the second quarter from the previous quarter, in what would be the sharpest such decline on record, the Bank of Spain said on Thursday.
""The fall in Spanish GDP looks to have accelerated significantly in the second quarter to a range whose midpoint would be a decline of around 20% quarter-on-quarter,"" it said as part of its quarterly economic report.
Earlier in June, the Spanish central bank said the impact of a lockdown that started in mid-March would be fully felt in the second quarter, with a contraction likely around 16%-21.8%.
On Tuesday, the Bank of Spain's governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos said the economy would begin recovering in the second half and, in a best-case scenario, could grow 16% in the third quarter versus the previous three months.
In its report, the Spanish central bank reiterated on Thursday the economy could overall contract by 9%-11.6% in 2020, without ruling out an even sharper contraction of 15.1% due to the possibility of a new wave of coronavirus.

On Wednesday, the International Monetary Fund published a forecast of an 12.8% economic slump for Spain this year due to the coronavirus.

840,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>",Spanish Technocrat Starts as Front-Runner in Eurogroup Race,"(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez named his economy minister, Nadia Calvino, as Spain’s candidate to lead meetings of the euro-area finance chiefs, confirming her position as the front-runner and officially launching the race for an informal but powerful post at a critical juncture for the region.
Calvino, 51, emerged as a leading candidate after Mario Centeno resigned as Portugal’s finance minister earlier this month. She has a curriculum that’s well-suited to the post, authorities in Spain say, as a moderate Socialist who spent nearly a decade as a senior official at the European Commission in Brussels before returning to Madrid when Sanchez took power in 2018. She would be the first woman to hold the post.
During the coronavirus crisis, Calvino has worked to bridge the differences between Spain’s business leaders and the minority coalition government which includes the far-left group Podemos, earning plaudits from executives and some economists. She’ll likely to face a challenge from Ireland’s Paschal Donohoe, according to a person familiar with the matter. Donohoe may attract support from the more fiscally conservative countries of northern Europe, with Ireland having sought to build links with nations such as the Netherlands and seeking new allies after Brexit.
Calvino has a fiscally conservative streak too, that has sometimes made her reluctant to support the government’s massive injection of coronavirus-crisis funds to bolster the floundering economy. But she has also been a strong backer of a euro-area budget and common insurance for bank deposits that may stir up opposition in the North.
Whoever is selected to head the Eurogroup will be leading efforts to rebuild the European economy and seize on the expected influx of crisis funds to brighten the outlook by making progress on the region’s weakpoints, such as digitalization and the competitive edge of major companies.
While officials in Madrid say they are cautiously optimistic about Calvino’s chances, they acknowledge that she faces some hurdles.
Spain already holds several top posts in the EU for starters.
Calvino’s predecessor Luis de Guindos is vice president of the European Central Bank. Former foreign minister Josep Borrell is the High Representative of the EU. And Spaniard Jose Manuel Campa is chair of the European Banking Authority.
Also, Spain’s economy has been one of the hardest-hit by the coronavirus crisis and the country is poised to be one of the single biggest recipients of financial aid from a package of funds that’s still being negotiated in Brussels. With so much at stake for Spain in the coming years, some countries might want a more neutral leader for the Eurogroup.
“Today I presented my candidacy to lead the Eurogroup, with the willingness to continue working for a strong and prosperous euro zone, for the benefit of all European citizens,” Calvino said on Twitter. The deadline for nominations is Thursday.
Potential Rival
Donohoe decided to make a bid for the role after consulting with counterparts around Europe to gauge his support.
His plans had been complicated by Ireland’s ongoing government talks with his party, Fine Gael, seeking to form the country’s first ever grand coalition. Donohoe’s decision to run is a clear signal he expects to remain as finance minister.
The Green Party on Friday will announce the results of a ballot by members on joining a coalition with the country’s two traditional parties of government, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail. If they vote against, Ireland could be facing another election.
While less prominent than during the euro-zone sovereign debt crisis, the Eurogroup presidency has been a sought-after post, giving its holder seats at the table at all the important and exclusive international fora. Originally designed as an informal meeting for finance ministers to exchange views, the group morphed into one of the most closely watched decision-making bodies in Europe.
While the president of the Eurogroup has no decision-making powers, the role calls for a skilled mediator who can broker agreements when the bloc faces major challenges.

LONDON (Reuters) - Volatility in markets during the COVID-19 shock point to underlying issues in the non-bank financial sector and steps may be taken to tighten the rules governing it, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Thursday.
The BoE's Financial Policy Committee will publish preliminary findings from its assessment of risks from non-banks in early August, Bailey told Britain's finance minister Rishi Sunak in a letter made available to the media.
Non-banks can include investment funds and money market funds.
""Where appropriate, the assessment will identify gaps in resilience in the non-bank financial sector and the potential measures that may be taken to increase resilience,"" the letter said.
Money market funds came under severe stress during bouts of heavy market volatility in March and were helped by broader central bank interventions to boost liquidity in markets. Many UK retail property funds were suspended as they were unable to value their assets.
The assessment will set out a list of possible indicators that the FPC could publish regularly to monitor risks from non-banks, Bailey said.
The BoE had already begun working on reducing risks in open-ended funds after the suspension of retail property funds in the aftermath of the June 2016 vote to leave the European Union, and later on the shuttering of a flagship fund run by then star stockpicker Neil Woodford.
Bailey said the FPC will have ""regards to opportunities"" in financial services from Britain's departure from the EU in relation to competition, innovation and competitiveness where it does not threaten financial stability.
Backers of Brexit have said that leaving the EU is an opportunity be more flexible with regulation to help London remain a globally competitive financial centre.

The BoE said it was committed to robust financial rules irrespective of Britain's future EU relationship.

844,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 06:28AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday, June 25th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- A surge in new cases of coronavirus in the U.S. leads to New York imposing a quarantine on out-of-state arrivals, while a closely-watched academic model raises its forecast for the U.S. death toll to 180,000 by October. That's putting the skids under stocks, which are struggling to bounce from Wednesday's sell-off, the worst in two weeks. Markets face a challenge from the release of the weekly jobless claims reports and first-quarter GDP. It's also putting the skids under oil and even gold. Meanwhile in Europe, payments company Wirecard becomes the first-ever DAX member to file for bankruptcy, but Lufthansa averts the same fate after shareholders accept the terms of a government bailout. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, June 25th.
1. U.S. epidemic spirals out of control again
The U.S. recorded over 34,000 new cases of Covid-19, approaching levels last seen at the high point of the epidemic in April.
New York, Connecticut and New Jersey to impose a 14-day quarantine on visitors arriving from the worst-affected states, a new development given that the U.S. had only previously imposed such restrictions on arrivals from abroad.
Florida and Texas both reported record new case numbers, while officials in Houston said that the city’s intensive care facilities would be maxed out today.
The University of Washington in Seattle raised its forecast for the U.S. death toll to 180,000 by October from around 122,000 currently.
2. Jobless claims, GDP, Durable Goods data all due
The U.S. will present its weekly figures for initial and continuing jobless claims at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with the number of new claims again expected to have fallen only marginally to 1.30 million, from 1.508 million a week earlier.
Continuing claims are expected to have fallen below 20 million for the first time since April – but that was also true ahead of the previous week’s report.   
The government will also announce revisions to its estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product. The number is of largely historical interest, given that the coronavirus barely touched the U.S. economy in March. Durable goods orders for May, to be released at the same time, will be more up-to-date information on the state of the economy, but will also be subject to high short-term volatility.
3. Stocks set to open mixed; Fed stress tests eyed
U.S. stock markets are set to open mixed after suffering their worst day since June 11 in response to the surge in Covid-19 cases across much of the country.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 futures contract was down 106 points or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was outperforming modestly, being up less than 0.1%.
Stocks in focus on Thursday will include the banks, who face the results of the Fed’s annual stress tests later in the day. The open question is whether the likelihood of a rise in bad loans due to the pandemic leads the Fed to impose restrictions on shareholder payouts and staff bonuses.
There will also be quarterly updates from JC Penney (OTC:JCPNQ), currently negotiating its way through Chapter 11 proceedings, and – after the closing bell –  Nike  (NYSE:NKE).
4. Wirecard succumbs, while Lufthansa accepts bailout
German payments company Wirecard said it had filed for bankruptcy protection, three days after admitting to a $2.1 billion hole in its accounts.  
The move anticipated the likely cancellations of key partnerships with companies such as Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and JCB after the exposure of what appears to have been massive fraud. Former CEO Markus Braun was arrested and released on bail earlier this week.
Wirecard, once a darling of both retail and institutional investors, had joined the benchmark DAX index in 2018, forcing out Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in a what struck many as a sign of the times. It’s the first sitting member of the DAX to file for bankruptcy.   
Another German ‘champion’, however, avoided the same fate on Wednesday as Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) shareholders swung behind a 9 billion euro government-sponsored bailout.
5. Risk-aversion pushes dollar high, commodities lower
The rise in risk-aversion prompted by the fears of a new wave of lockdowns pushed the dollar higher and commodities lower.
By 6:30 AM, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of developed-market peers, was up 0.2% at 97.34, only 0.2% away from what would be its high for the month. However, its biggest gains came as bounces from oversold levels against the safe haven yen and Swiss franc.
U.S. crude oil prices, by contrast, fell 1.0% to $37.61 a barrel and are down some 7.5% from the highs they hit earlier in the week on hopes that the physical crude market is rebalancing. Brent futures fell 0.7% to hold just above the $40 a barrel mark.
Gold futures, meanwhile, fell 0.4% to $1,768.50, again underlining a higher correlation to risk assets as it assumes a greater part in leveraged retail portfolios that are susceptible to short-term pressure in equities."
845,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 06:18AM ET</span>","Turkey’s Rate Cutting Cycle May Be Near an End, Banks Say","(Bloomberg) --
Turkey’s central bank will probably cut borrowing costs one more time this year, according to economists at some of the world’s biggest banks, amid a worsening inflation outlook and a shrinking rate of return for investors.
An uninterrupted easing cycle started almost a year ago when Turkey’s key interest rate was at 24% following a currency crash. All but two of the 20 analysts in a Bloomberg survey predict the central bank will lower its benchmark again on Thursday, with more than half seeing a quarter-percentage point cut to 8%.
Analysts at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc believe this will likely be the final reduction of 2020, while  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and Oxford Economics are warning of a risk that rates may soon have to rise.
Complementing the monetary easing delivered since Governor Murat Uysal’s abrupt appointment last July, the central bank has also been pumping money into the economy at the fastest pace in over a decade to contain the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. After nine straight rate decreases, Turkey has one of the lowest yields in the world when adjusted for prices.
Even with a recent upswing inflation, the central bank has suggested the acceleration is likely temporary, a sign for  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) that nothing stands in the way of additional rate cuts.
“We think that the inflation print would not discourage Turkey’s central bank from further easing,” Morgan Stanley economists Alina Slyusarchuk, Andrea Masia and Georgi Deyanov said in a report to clients.
Interrupting the easing cycle would carry risks for Uysal, whose predecessor was fired by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for not reducing rates. Contrary to the thinking of most economists and central banks, Erdogan believes lower borrowing costs are more effective at slowing prices.
The central bank, which says it still provides a “reasonable” real rate of return based on projected price growth, lowered its inflation expectations for the end of this year to 7.4% in April, less than a previous forecast of 8.2%.
A rebound in energy markets now “adds upward pressure from here,” according to Barclays economists including Ercan Erguzel, who expect a 50 basis-point rate cut on Thursday to conclude the easing cycle.
The price outlook has started to show signs of deterioration. Turkey’s consumer inflation unexpectedly quickened to an annual 11.4% in May, snapping two months of declines, as elevated food costs offset some of the impact from weaker demand.
Now that real rates are at their lowest since 1913, according to JPMorgan, the central bank may be ready to call time on its easing cycle. With a “final” cut of 25 basis points this week, policy makers could “signal the beginning of a wait-and-see period with no imminent rate changes,” JPMorgan analysts including Yarkin Cebeci said in a report to clients.
“Along with rapid loan growth, such low rates constitute significant support for domestic demand and if sustained could jeopardize the disinflation,” they said. “Lower yields hurt the lira’s attractiveness and prevent the capital inflows that are needed for sustainable economic growth.”

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A boycott of goods from China may not be feasible as India is dependent on such imports, although New Delhi should try to cut its dependence on them, India's top export promotion grouping said on Thursday.
As calls have grown in India for Chinese products to be shunned after a border clash between the neighbours killed 20 Indian soldiers, customs officials at the key port of Chennai have held shipments originating from China for extra checks.
""We extend our support to the government to make India self-reliant in the face of the recent tiff with China, but we should also keep in mind that we depend on China for a lot of key raw materials,"" said Sharad Kumar Saraf, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO).
The government should ask Indians to stop buying Chinese items that are also made by Indian companies, but a ban or boycott of all Chinese products would hurt Indian manufacturers, Saraf told reporters.
Greater scrutiny of shipments from China at the southern port of Chennai, one of India's biggest, handling cargo ranging from automobiles and auto components to fertiliser and petroleum products, could disrupt supply chains.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been vocal about promoting domestic manufacturing and protecting small firms. Last month Modi launched ""Atmanirbhar Bharat"", a campaign for a self-reliant India, in addition to his ""Make in India"" programme.
""Our companies import a lot of raw materials that are critical for making the goods that we export,"" said Ajay Sahai, director general of FIEO.
""We should avoid a knee-jerk reaction.""
Two-way trade was worth $88 billion in the fiscal year to March 2019, with a deficit of $53.5 billion in China’s favour, India's widest with any country.
The most recent data shows India's trade deficit with China was $46.8 billion between April 2019 and February 2020.

The sanctions restrict the bank's access to some financial transactions and to capital markets in the EU.

Proposals for the new chair must be submitted by the end of the day ahead of a confirmation vote planned for July 9, a government source said. 
Calvino, who is also a deputy prime minister in Spain's left-wing coalition government, has been tipped as a front-runner to take on the role by officials in Brussels.
The post has been vacant since Portuguese Finance Minister Mario Centeno announced earlier in June that he would not seek a second 2 1/2 year term.
Madrid has long held ambitions of chairing the group but with designs on leadership of the World Trade Organisation for Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya, the government may have to choose between which post it wants to lobby for most. 

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said it would be an honour for Calvino to head the group and noted she would be the first woman to hold the role.

850,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 02:46AM ET</span>",Coronavirus and Merkel's quest for legacy speed up German rebalancing,"By Michael Nienaber and Rene Wagner
BERLIN (Reuters) - A coronavirus-induced plunge in German exports and a fiscal U-turn by Chancellor Angela Merkel as she seeks to cement her place in history are accelerating a long demanded rebalancing of Europe's largest economy.
For years, Germany's huge trade surpluses and its hesitancy to stimulate domestic demand with substantial infrastructure spending have frustrated international organizations and European allies who argue Berlin could do more at home to support growth elsewhere.
The trade surplus has also been used by U.S. President Donald Trump to underline his America First narrative that Germany was exploiting the United States, the world's largest economy.
But with the coronavirus pandemic disrupting trade across the globe and Merkel turning Germany's traditionally cautious fiscal policy upside down, its current account surplus - a wider measure of international flows - is shrinking fast, according to projections from its central bank and finance ministry.
There are signs that this shift could last. Merkel and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz are willing to suspend the debt brake - constitutionally enshrined rules which significantly curb German stimulus borrowing - again next year, three government officials told Reuters.
The conservative leader and the centre-left vice chancellor are also determined to strengthen the European Union at a time when its cohesion has been rocked by Britain's departure and challenges from the United States and China, the sources said.
After decades of German resistance, Merkel and Scholz are backing an unprecedented 500 billion euros of joint European debt issuance to aid member states worst hit by COVID-19 and tackle growing discrepancies in the bloc.
""Merkel is worried about two things: that a second wave of infections could force authorities to implement another lockdown and that Europe could break apart because of the crisis,"" said one of the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
After 15 years in power and with her chancellorship coming to a self-determined end with the general election next year, Merkel now has room to act more freely and think more about how history will judge her, a second senior official told Reuters.
""With Germany taking over the rotating EU presidency for six months from July, there was always the plan to breathe more life into the pledge of European solidarity,"" the official said.
""The coronavirus crisis accelerated this and underlined the urgency to act even more boldly now,"" the official added.
The German central bank expects the pandemic to slash exports by more than 13% in 2020 while imports are only predicted to fall by 7%.
""This together creates downward pressure on the trade surplus and with it the current account surplus,"" Bundesbank chief economist Jens Ulbrich told Reuters.
Graphic: Germany’s current account surplus shrinks, https://graphics.reuters.com/GERMANY-ECONOMY/rlgpdlkejpo/chart.png
The central bank expects the latter surplus to fall below 5% of economic output this year from above 7% in 2019. This would be the lowest level since 2005 and sharply down from a peak of 8.6% reached in 2015.
""With the recovery of the global economy, the balance will increase again by 2022, but without reaching the levels of previous years,"" Ulbrich said.
The European Commission, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) all expect the surplus to shrink too, though to a smaller extent.
They are also unsure if the German rebalancing will last beyond the pandemic.
""Whether the effect is temporary will depend in part on the rebound in global demand for capital goods. The Chinese economy is shifting towards a more consumption-led growth model, which will reduce the demand for German exports more permanently,"" Andrew Barker, head of the Germany desk at the OECD Economics Department, told Reuters.
Germany's large stimulus package, financed with record new borrowing of 218.5 billion euros this year, is having a clear effect this year, but the future budget path is not certain.
Nora Hesse, a Berlin-based economic advisor to the European Commission, said German savings were likely to remain high due to its ageing population while public and private sector investment were still subdued.
""That's why the European Commission continues to recommend Germany increase its investment in the green and digital transformation of its economy, in training and education, research and innovation, as well as in housing,"" Hesse said.
Shekhar Aiyar, the IMF's mission chief for Germany, cautioned that a drop in the current account surplus might be temporary and recommended Berlin continue its growth-oriented fiscal policy beyond the current crisis.
The IMF sees the surplus remaining above 6 percent of GDP in the medium term, supported by growing investment income flows from large net foreign assets, Aiyar said.
As striking as German fiscal efforts to tackle the coronavirus crisis have been, Berlin will remain under pressure from international bodies and its euro zone neighbours to stay the course.
""Germany's surplus in recent years borders on mercantilism and has been a blight on the world economy,"" Harvard University economist Dani Rodrik told Reuters, but he added that Berlin's fiscal response to the crisis was impressive.

""Especially during the pandemic, Germany should not be a contributor to recession in the rest of the world.""

(Reuters) - China is adding a new face to its trade negotiation team by appointing its chief representative at the World Bank to head the Finance Ministry's international cooperation department, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Yang Yingming, who has been Executive Director for China at the World Bank in Washington since 2016, returns to the finance ministry months after Beijing and Washington completed a Phase 1 agreement that brought a truce to their bitter trade war, although bilateral tensions remain at their worst in decades.
Yang, who is among a group of rising Chinese economic policymakers with international experience, told some of his colleagues recently in Washington that he was returning to China to work on G-20 coordination and Sino-U.S. trade talks, two of them said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Yang, the finance ministry, and the World Bank's Beijing office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Yang, who studied English literature at Beijing Foreign Studies University and development economics at the University of Manchester in Britain, was also executive director for China at the Asian Development Bank until 2012, before moving to the finance ministry.
Yang is a fluent English speaker known for openness and a sense of humour, two of the people said, declining to be named as they were not authorized to speak to media.
The appointment further reflects Beijing's keenness to maintain engagement and prevent ties worsening, said Li Mingjiang, associate professor at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. 
Beijing and Washington have had limited high-level engagement this year as they square off over a range of friction points, from the coronavirus to Hong Kong, although China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held talks in Hawaii earlier this month.

""Both sides still want to face their problems and resolve them through negotiation, instead of heading towards decoupling,"" said Li.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy is shrinking at its fastest pace in centuries as the devastation wrought by the coronavirus pandemic saps demand, but it's likely to bounce back to growth next quarter as more businesses reopen, a Reuters poll found.
An historic downturn pushed the Bank of England to unleash unprecedented amounts of stimulus, and while it has slowed the pace of purchases, it is likely to increase its total spending again, the June 19-24 poll predicted.
The coronavirus has infected around 9.3 million people globally and Britain has the highest related death toll in Europe, despite a government-imposed lockdown that forced businesses to close their doors and citizens to stay home.
Although the number of cases reported daily is dropping in Britain, a second wave of coronavirus infections was given as the biggest threat to the economic outlook, according to over three-quarters of respondents to an additional question in the poll.
As activity ground to a near-halt after the March 23 lockdown, the poll predicted the economy would contract 17.3% this quarter, not quite as bad as the 17.5% fall forecast in May. Forecasts ranged from to a 6.3% drop to 25.5%.
In a worst-case scenario it will shrink 19.0% this quarter, according to median forecasts.
But like other countries around the world, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has slowly started to ease lockdown restrictions and the economy was expected to bounce back and grow 10.5% next quarter as a result.
""April was undoubtedly the low point in activity. We'll probably see a more pronounced rebound during the third quarter as a broader range of businesses are expected to reopen,"" said James Smith at ING. 
""But even then, the economy will remain well below its pre-virus size, and we don't think it will be until late 2022 or 2023 until it has returned to those levels.""
This year, the economy will contract 8.7%, medians in the poll of nearly 80 economists showed, and then grow 5.5% next year.
To support the economy, the Bank of England has cut its key interest rate to a record low of 0.10% and restarted asset purchases, or quantitative easing (QE). Last week, it bolstered its firepower by a further 100 billion pounds ($125 billion).
Only one member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee - Chief Economist Andy Haldane - voted against the increase as he thought there was evidence a recovery was already taking shape.
While the Bank surprised financial markets by saying it expected the latest asset purchases increase to see it through to the end of the year, 26 of 35 respondents to an additional question said it was not yet done with easing. All of those said it would again add more QE.
""The MPC won't decide on more until November or December. By that point, we suspect Haldane's hopes will have been dashed, unemployment will be much higher, and inflation will still be well below the 2% target,"" said Andrew Wishart at Capital Economics.
""We suspect that the MPC will eventually increase the stock of QE from 745 billion pounds to a shade under 1 trillion pounds.""
No change in Bank Rate was predicted until 2023 at the earliest.
TRANSITIONING
Britain's transition period after leaving the European Union is due to expire at the end of December, and despite the havoc caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Britain has repeatedly said it would not ask for an extension.
But just over three-quarters, 26 of 34, of respondents to an additional question said it should be extended.
""Ruling out an extension to the transition period is a foolish move by a government that does not appear to be acting in the economy's interests,"" said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
Still, as has been consistent in Reuters polls since the June 2016 vote to leave the EU, economists expected the two sides to agree on a trade deal. 
""Without an extension of the transition period, the UK risks exiting the EU with only a bare bones deal at best,"" said Martin Weder at ZKB. ""In combination with the deep recession in the UK and the government's poor record in handling the pandemic, this results in a very bleak economic outlook.""

853,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 08:52PM ET</span>","Japan's izakayas, once a staple of after-work socialising, crippled by pandemic","By Leika Kihara and Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's after-work drinking scene has been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, forcing its often jam-packed ""izakaya"" dining bars to reinvent themselves to survive.
For decades, izakayas - a mainstay of Japanese working culture and late-night drinking - have thrived by offering cheap drinks to thirsty office workers in cozy settings.
Even though lockdown measures to contain the virus were lifted in late May, izakayas are facing an existential crisis as more people work from home and social-distancing rules force most eating and drinking outlets to halve their seating.
""I used to drink out about twice a week. Not anymore,"" said 26-year-old Erika Aoi. ""It was nice to hang out with colleagues after work, so it's sad the culture is shrinking.""
Hitoshi Yaosaka's shops are among those hit hard. The 10 izakayas he runs in Tokyo have seen customer numbers return to only a third of their pre-pandemic levels, with fewer workers commuting to nearby offices.
""If drinking out isn't considered welcome, izakayas will go under. There's a pretty good chance Japan's izakaya culture will die down,"" says Yaosaka, who warns that small izakayas like his aren't profitable if the already-tiny establishments cut counter seats by half.
The government hasn't given a timeframe for how long the restrictions will last. But officials warn they must stay in place until an effective vaccine is developed. That may prod more companies to allow employees to work from home and reduce opportunities for drinking outings with far-flung colleagues.
Restaurants make up 16% of coronavirus-related bankruptcies in Japan so far, according to data from think tank Tokyo Shoko Research.
The gloom could put a dent in consumption for months if not years, and prolong Japan's already deepening recession.
""Consumption may rebound somewhat in June but will take a very long time to return to pre-pandemic levels,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
The disappearance of social drinking has hit restaurant and izakaya chain operators like Colowide, which is shutting 7% of its 2,665 outlets. Rival Watami is also closing 13% of about 500 outlets.
Takeshi Niinami, a government adviser and head of Japanese beverage maker Suntory Holdings, warns that more than 20% of bars and restaurants could fail because of the pandemic.
""Given the current coronavirus situation, what I'd like to see is for them to make it through the next two to three years until we can allow for more noisy, intimate get-togethers,"" Niinami said.
Surviving that long is no easy task for many izakayas in a shrinking market. Some are rethinking their business models.
Watami will open new wagyu beef restaurants targeting families and launch a fried chicken delivery service.
Setouchi Lemon Shokudo, an izakaya near Tokyo's Nihonbashi business district, was packed with office workers before the pandemic.
Now, social-distancing policies have forced the shop to cut seats to 30 from 50. Sales and visitor numbers in June are still 30% of what they were a year ago.
To make up for lost sales, the shop bought a food truck to sell lunches to a wider range of customers. It also started selling take-out meals and food online.
Tadao Nakashima, CEO of Bears Corp, which owns Setouchi Lemon, does not expect business to recover this year.
""The pandemic has shaken the foundation of our business, which is to provide a venue for face-to-face communication,"" said Nakashima, who has been in the izakaya business for more than two decades.

""We may need to come up with a model that doesn't focus too much on alcohol.""

Weintraub, one of the loudest right-wing ideologues in President Jair Bolsonaro's government, resigned as education minister last week, saying he would join the World Bank. 
He became a target of a Supreme Court probe following the publication of a videotape of a cabinet meeting in which he called its judges ""bums"" who should be jailed. 
World Bank employees called on the bank's ethics committee to suspend Weintraub's nomination while reviewing whether his past statements were in line with the code of conduct for directors. Weintraub could not be immediately reached for comment. 
The World Bank employees cited Weintraub's comments on Twitter that mocked Chinese accents, blamed China for COVID-19, and accused China of seeking to dominate the world. 
Among other objections, the letter pointed to Weintraub's statements against the protection of minorities and his last act as minister to revoke some race-based quotas at universities.
In response to the staff's letter, the chair of the board's ethics committee, Guenther Schoenleitner, said the World Bank would not tolerate racist remarks by anyone serving there, including executive directors.
However, in his reply seen by Reuters, Schoenleitner said neither the bank's management nor the ethics committee had any influence on the nomination and election of an executive director, who would be subject to the board's code after becoming a member.
Brazil has a majority of the voting power in a group of nine countries that must fill a vacant position and so Weintraub could be elected to serve as executive director until the end of the current term on Oct. 31.

Weintraub is under investigation by Brazil's federal audit court on questions of whether he traveled to the United States on a diplomatic passport after leaving office.

855,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 08:20PM ET</span>",Global housing markets ensnared by pandemic's high unemployment,"By Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The outlook for major global housing markets looks subdued, with high unemployment from the coronavirus pandemic and lockdowns and low immigration the biggest hurdles over the coming year, according to a majority of analysts polled by Reuters.
The coronavirus has killed more than 480,000 people worldwide, infected about 9.3 million and left many millions jobless. It has also pushed the global economy into a deep recession with the rebound expected to be slow and long as the pandemic still spreads in stages. 
That comes despite an unprecedented amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus, sparking a rally in stock markets from late-March troughs, along with steady re-openings of many economies from lockdown.
While average home prices in a few countries polled were forecast to rise this year or next or both, fears of a prolonged drop in activity increased in the June 9-24 global poll of more than 100 property market experts compared with just three months ago.
With several risks still at play, house prices in Australia, India, Dubai, Britain, Canada and the United States were forecast to fall this year and next under a worst-case scenario. 
""Our general view is that prices across most major markets will fall, probably around 5%...and in some it could be more significant,"" said Liam Bailey, global head of research at Knight Frank in London. 
""The risks are to the downside. The big thing that we don't know is the potential for a second outbreak and lockdown. And if we get another significant lockdown, then there is every chance that prices would fall again.""
(GRAPHIC: Reuters Poll - Global housing market outlook: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/dgkvlxwqnvb/Housing%20market%20outlook.PNG)
The U.S. housing market, at the epicenter of the previous financial crisis that led to a global recession, was expected to remain a bright spot and defy the economic downturn, supported by record low mortgage rates and limited supply. 
While the availability of affordable homes has been a chronic problem there for several years, the main risk is unemployment, which has jumped from record lows to record highs within a couple of months and is expected to remain well above pre-COVID levels until at least 2022. 
High joblessness is the biggest hurdle housing markets will face over the coming year, according to two-thirds of more than 100 analysts across the countries surveyed. More than 10% said lower immigration will dampen housing markets.
""Rising unemployment and the risk of redundancies is likely to have a negative impact on the housing market over the coming months. Many people will choose to put off any major financial decisions, including buying or selling a house, until they are clearer on their income security and the economic outlook has improved,"" said Jamie Durham, economist at PwC in London.
""The impact on the housing market is likely to be felt disproportionately in areas with large hospitality and tourism sectors, which have been most affected by the virus.""
(GRAPHIC: Reuters Poll - U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, India and Dubai housing market outlook: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/nmovajkbxpa/Reuters%20housing%20wrap.png)
More than 80% of nearly 100 respondents said the recovery to pre-COVID-19 levels would be ""gradual,"" or ""slow and long."" The rest said it will be quick or it already has. 
Indian and Australian house prices were forecast to fall this year and next on higher unemployment, while weak consumer confidence and fears of a second wave of infections has dampened chances for a sustainable rebound in China. 
British home prices were forecast to fall this year. In Canada, they were expected to rise at a much slower pace than predicted three months ago and fall next year, with high household debt a real challenge. 
""Supply (of homes) will increase when public emergency payments end as certain households will face higher debt payments as a result of mortgage payment deferrals,"" said Marc Pinsonneault, senior economist at National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) in Montreal, noting an additional risk to outright job losses.
""Add to that those who used to list houses on the Airbnb platform and could not rent them because of international travel restrictions. Some might also (just) want to sell.""
Migration to the suburbs from city centers as more people accustomed to working from home and who can seek space and gardens might ease some housing shortage in major urban areas.
Just over half of 72 analysts who answered an additional question predicted a move out of major cities in the medium- to long-term.
""It will be fine-tuning rather than mass-exodus,"" said Miles Shipside, director at UK property website Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY). ""Cities are convenient as the commute is shorter, but access to outside space and space internally are bigger factors. That might mean finding that in cities, or moving further out.""

Britain is slowly reopening after more than three months of lockdown that has pushed some businesses to the brink and forced the government to borrow billions to support its economy.
The government will present legislation aimed at allowing pubs, cafes and restaurants more freedom to operate outside, where experts say the risk of COVID-19 transmission is lower.
The Business and Planning Bill will include changes to allow venues to spread out into pedestrianised areas, terraces and car parks, and temporarily allow them to sell alcohol that can be consumed off the premises, a government source said.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a broad outline of the next stage of Britain's return to business on Tuesday, saying he was looking forward to visiting a pub, eating in a restaurant and having his hair cut.
The legislation due to be published on Thursday builds on that, and is seen as a key step towards getting the hospitality sector, some of which has been forced to shut entirely, back on its feet. 

Once passed into law by parliament, the measures will apply to England, with rules in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland mostly determined by their own devolved governments.

(Reuters) - The United States needs a ""structural"" response to the lack of Black economic progress, St. Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard said Wednesday, noting that decades of efforts to improve outcomes had so far failed.
Citing the perhaps 10 to one gulf in white to Black wealth, Bullard said that early in his career he would have expected that to narrow over time as employment and educational opportunities expanded and Blacks gained more political representation. 
Decades later, ""what is very distressing and disturbing is that it does not seem to be getting much better...We are going to have to roll up our sleeves and get much better at this,"" Bullard said. ""And I think without putting words in their mouth that is what protesters are saying – this has been going on too long and the solutions we have tried are not working.”
His remarks, in a webcast to the Greater Louisville Chamber of Commerce in Kentucky, come amid a broad national conversation about racial equity sparked by recent killings of Blacks by police, including an incident in Louisville. 
Fed officials including Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the central bank's only Black policymaker, Atlanta Fed chief Raphael Bostic, have all spoken out on the issue recently.
“I am outraged and horrified by injustices toward the Black community. Racism has no place in our society, and each of us has a responsibility to combat it,” Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said in a separate event on Wednesday.
Bullard cast it in more structural economic terms, suggesting the need for a systemic response to match what are increasingly recognized as embedded, systemic problems.
He did not offer specific proposals. Fed officials have typically downplayed their ability to influence how wealth is distributed, arguing that the best thing they can do is set conditions to keep the unemployment rate as low as possible. 
But there has been a debate developing within the central bank over how its employment goals should be interpreted given the persistent gaps in the unemployment rate, with Black joblessness consistently twice that of whites, and even more in times of recession.
More broadly, some economists have proposed the need for reparations to offset decades of slavery and subsequent segregation.

""Structural and historical factors continue to suppress the ability of Black Americans to accumulate wealth,"" Bullard said. ""To promote racial economic equity we as a nation must consider structural or institutional responses.""

858,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 05:00PM ET</span>",France plans to pare terms of work scheme designed to boost activity,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French government laid out plans on Wednesday to rein in from October a reduced-time work scheme set up during the coronavirus crisis to prevent mass permanent layoffs.
The scheme's update comes as France and other European countries that set up furlough schemes to save jobs grapple with how to encourage firms to put workers back into their jobs despite a still-fragile economic outlook, while keeping down the cost to the public purse.
Companies had put 7.8 million workers on furloughs or reduced schedules as of the end of May, Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud said last week.
From Oct. 1, workers will get 60% of their normal gross wages under the scheme, down from 70% currently, President Emmanuel Macron told employers and unions. Meanwhile, the state will reimburse employers up to 60% of the cost, instead of 85% currently.
However, a company can tap the existing furlough arrangements for only up to six months. On Wednesday the government also outlined a new longer-term programme that is more generous for the employee and company but demands commitments to safeguarding jobs.
The programme will allow a company to reduce an employee's work by up to 40%. Workers will receive up to 70% of gross wages for the period out of work, with the state reimbursing firms up to 85% if the programme is tapped before October and 80% thereafter.
The government did not say how much the extended reduced-work scheme would cost the Treasury.
Unions broadly welcomed the new arrangement. But the hard-left CGT and Force Ouvriere said they regretted that job retention guarantees imposed during the period of reduced-work would not be binding beyond that.
""Even though they will benefit from financial support, companies will still be able to terminate jobs at the end of it, which is somewhat paradoxical,"" CGT boss Philippe Martinez told reporters.
Meanwhile, workers' time not spent on the job would have to be used for training, with the state taking on up to 80% of the cost.

“There’s a huge amount of uncertainty,” Prince, who helps manage the firm’s investment process alongside co-CIOs Ray Dalio and Greg Jensen, said Wednesday in an interview during the Bloomberg Invest Global virtual event.
Bridgewater’s hedge fund has suffered losses this year amid the market chaos surrounding the coronavirus pandemic. The firm’s flagship Pure Alpha II fund fell 20% in 2020 through May. Bridgewater got hit by the crisis at “the worst possible moment,” when its portfolios were positioned to profit from rising markets, Dalio wrote in mid-March. The Westport, Connecticut-based firm saw a 15% drop in assets during March and April, declining to $138 billion.
Bridgewater wasn’t alone in getting caught on the wrong side of a sell-off that began in late February. Several prominent names have stumbled as the spread of the pandemic halted the economy and put an end to Wall Street’s longest-ever bull run. But U.S. stocks have since defied initial gloomy expectations, rallying 37% since the March low, with stimulus from the Federal Reserve and the easing of lockdowns fueling hopes for a fast recovery.
Prince has previously said that the fund is exploring ways to capitalize on the resilience of basic goods and services as companies that sell household staples such as fruits and vegetables have seen cash flows steadily climb during the quarantine. He’s also said that there could be a “duration mismatch” between how long and deeply the pandemic hits in relation to how long fiscal and monetary spending can continue, and warned that fiscal policy is replacing missing income but not necessarily lost spending.

860,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>","Fed's Evans: U.S. recovery to take years, outbreaks to slow growth","By Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans on Wednesday said he expects the U.S. economy to take until late in 2022 to recover to its pre-crisis level of output, with some economic growth permanently lost to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. 
""Even after three years, my projected recovery places us below where the economy would have been had the virus not occurred,"" he told a Corridor Business Journal conference in Iowa, via videolink. ""The economic impact has been catastrophic for an extraordinarily large number of people and businesses, (and) sadly, the cost has fallen most heavily on some of our most vulnerable populations."" 
A surprise jump in payrolls in May likely signals stronger underlying demand than analysts had expected, he said. It also probably shows workers and consumers felt comfortable enough to return to stores sooner than anticipated.
And that return, he added, may have its downside. 
""My forecast assumes growth is held back by the response to intermittent localized outbreaks - which might be made worse by the faster-than-expected reopenings,"" he said.
The Fed earlier this month signaled it will keep interest rates low for years to support growth, and policymakers forecast the economy to shrink about 6.5% this year and unemployment to end the year at 9%. 
DOWNSIDE RISKS
With some 20 million Americans out of a job, a drop in spending and economic activity weighing on inflation, and the most uncertain outlook he's ever seen in his career, Evans said, risks are ""weighted to the downside"" for even that grim forecast. 
""Other forecasts with more severe effects on economic activity are almost equally as plausible in my view,"" Evans said adding that while fiscal and monetary policy support have helped, ""more may be necessary."" 
In particular need are local and state governments, even the most fiscally responsible of which could not have been expected to be prepared to withstand the drop in sales tax and other revenues that are forcing tens of billions of dollars of budget cuts across the country, he said.
""There is a role for the federal government to provide relief assistance of some magnitude,"" he said, noting the ""awful lot of employment in state and local government and the associated impact from the things that those employees buy or don't buy if they are laid off.""

“My forecast assumes growth is held back by the response to intermittent localized outbreaks -- which might be made worse by the faster-than-expected reopenings,” Evans said Wednesday in remarks prepared for a virtual event.
“In this environment, many resources will be devoted to health and safety. I assume health solutions become widely available as we move through 2022, and I allow for a return to more normal operations by late in the year,” Evans said.
The Chicago Fed chief pointed to the median of projections published by Fed policy makers on June 10, which showed the U.S. unemployment rate may still be 5.5% by the end of 2022. It surged from 3.5% in February to 14.7% in April, before dipping back down to 13.3% in May as many localities lifted stay-at-home orders.
Now, small businesses in emerging hot spots like Texas and Arizona are beginning to see a decline in foot traffic again as cases there surge, and some bars and restaurants are closing their doors for a second time.
“Until the virus is treatable or controlled through other measures, the return of economic activity hinges on the ability of businesses to provide safe workplaces and consumer environments,” Evans said. “How much these efforts will allow activity to recover is an open question.”

The IMF said it now expects 2020 global output to shrink by 4.9%, compared with a 3.0% contraction predicted in April, when it used data available as widespread business lockdowns were just getting into full swing.
A recovery in 2021 also will be weaker, with global growth forecast at 5.4% for the year compared to 5.8% in the April forecast. The Fund said, however, that a major new outbreak in 2021 could shrink the year's growth to a barely perceptible 0.5%.
Although many economies have begun to reopen, the Fund said that the unique characteristics of lockdowns and social distancing have conspired to hit both investment and consumption.
""We are definitely not out of the woods. We have not escaped the Great Lockdown,"" IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath told a news conference. ""Given this tremendous uncertainty, policymakers should remain vigilant."" 
The IMF views the current recession as the worst since the 1930s Great Depression, which saw global GDP shrink 10%, but Gopinath said that the $10 trillion in fiscal support and massive easing by central banks had so far prevented large-scale bankruptcies. More support will be needed, she added.
Advanced economies have been particularly hard-hit, with U.S. output now expected to shrink 8.0% and the euro zone 10.2% in 2020, both more than 2 percentage points worse than the April forecast, the IMF said.
Latin American economies, where infections are still rising, saw some of the largest downgrades, with Brazil's economy now expected to shrink 9.1%, Mexico's 10.5% and Argentina's 9.9% in 2020.

China, where businesses started reopening in April and new infections have been minimal, is the only major economy now expected to show positive growth in 2020, now forecast at 1.0% compared to 1.2% in the April forecast.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's economic growth and fiscal outlook this year are shaping up to be worse than official government forecasts, making a return to austerity and reforms next year all the more pressing, Treasury Secretary Mansueto Almeida said on Wednesday.
Almeida said the public sector primary deficit this year excluding interest payments could reach 800 billion reais ($152 billion), or more than 11% of gross domestic product, while the economy is set to shrink around 6-7%.
That compares with current government projections of a primary deficit of around 700 billion reais, or almost 10% of GDP, and the economy shrinking 4.7% due to the COVID-19 crisis.
Speaking in an online live event hosted by Citi, Almeida said that under these circumstances the nominal public sector deficit, which includes interest payments, could hit 17% of GDP.
""All the growth in public sector expenditure will start and finish in this fiscal year, which means we are not contaminating next year, except for the revenue side,"" Almeida said.
""I'm not worried now about debt sustainability. I could be worried, one or two years from now, if we fail to approve anything (on economic reforms) or for some reason we don't comply with the spending cap,"" he said.
Almeida insisted the government's agenda of cutting public spending, speeding up privatizations and concessions, and pushing ahead with tax reform will help the economy rebound and attract increased private-sector investment.
This will also show credit ratings agencies that ""we are doing our homework"" and keeping Brazil on track to regain its investment grade status at some point.
Still, Brazil's debt-to-GDP, set to hit a record 95% this year, might not peak and start falling until 2025 or 2026, Almeida said.

Britain left the European Union earlier this year and is now in the process of negotiating bilateral trade deals with major partners like the United States - something the government has cited as a major benefit of leaving the EU.
""We're not going to rush into a deal and there is no deadline. We will be tough in pressing our interests,"" Truss told a parliamentary committee. 
""The U.S. talk a good game about free trade and low tariffs. But the reality is that many UK products have been kept unfairly out of their markets,"" she added.
Earlier, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said talks were continuing at a good pace and that the current round was due to end this week. Truss said she expected a couple of chapters of the deal to be finalised during the next round, but did not specify which.
Nevertheless, she struck a combative tone, citing U.S. tariffs on British steel, the threat of further tariffs on cars and U.S.-centric procurement schemes which restrict access to government contracts. She said a U.S. ban on lamb exports amounted to protectionism. 

""Let me be clear. I am not going to strike a trade deal with the U.S., unless all these points are dealt with,"" she said. ""No deal is better than a bad deal.""

The idea, launched by the Allied Pilots Association (APA) representing American Airlines' (O:AAL) 15,000 pilots, is aimed at easing a return to pre-pandemic passenger levels while creating a level playing field across the airline industry.
As of now, some but not all U.S. airlines are blocking middle seats or capping the number of seats they are selling on each flight in order to allow for more space between passengers.
Air travel has dropped dramatically in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. 
In a statement, APA President Eric Ferguson said uniform social distancing would encourage passengers to fly more and airlines to operate more flights, thus preserving more jobs in the critical aviation industry.
Under the plan, the price of empty seats would be based on industry average costs for 2019, and as immunity to COVID-19 rose, the number of empty seats bought by the government would fall.

Nadia Calvino said that despite recent signs of more favourable data in labour market figures, the government would not change its prediction of 9.2% contraction in 2020 announced at the beginning of May.
""Our forecasts are prudent and our actions are right (...) if the recovery continues in Europe without any significant setbacks, the recovery will gradually accelerate during the second half of the year and throughout 2021,"" Calvino told parliament.
Calvino's comments came before the International Monetary Fund published a forecast of an 12.8% economic slump for Spain this year due to the coronavirus.

He also said Lebanon would not get a penny from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any donor state unless it carries out reforms, at the forefront of them accelerating an overhaul of its loss-making electricity sector.
The Lebanese pound has lost about 75% of its value since October, when long-brewing economic troubles mushroomed into a financial crisis regarded ass the biggest threat to Lebanon since its 1975-1990 civil war.
The pound, officially pegged at 1,507.5 to the dollar since 1997, traded at 6,300/6,500 on the parallel market Wednesday, a market participant said, weaker than levels of 6,000/6,200 cited by market participants on Tuesday.
With dollars scarce, the financial meltdown has frozen savers out of their deposits and forced up prices in the import-dependent economy.
""It is unacceptable that Lebanese be made hostages of black markets in currency, food, medicine and fuel,"" Berri said during an emergency meeting of the Amal Movement, the Shi'ite Muslim party he leads.
Donor states that have provided Lebanon with aid in the past have said it will not receive any until it undertakes reforms to fix the state corruption and waste that are at the root of the crisis. Lebanon began talks with the IMF in May.
""Any Lebanese official will be mistaken if he believes the IMF or any state or donor party can give us one penny of aid if we do not implement reforms,"" Berri said.

""Frankly, the world and international community believes Lebanon is a bottomless basket, and before this bottom is closed there will be no aid.""

LONDON (Reuters) - China's pledge to relieve the debt burden owed to it by some emerging market governments could ease near-term liquidity pressures in nations struggling with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, Fitch Ratings said on Wednesday.
Kenya, the Maldives, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Pakistan, Angola, Laos, Mozambique, Congo and Zambia are among countries with a significant share of their debt owed to China and eligible for debt relief, Fitch said.
The Chinese government has committed to participation in the group of 20 major nations' (G20) debt service suspension initiative (DSSI), which temporarily suspends debt repayments for 77 developing nations falling due between May and December.
Chinese financial institutions should consult with African countries to work out arrangements for loans with sovereign guarantees, President Xi Jinping said in a speech last week. Fitch said it viewed such loans as bilateral debt.
""China's involvement in the G20 initiative marks the first time it is participating in coordinated, multilateral global debt relief efforts,"" Fitch said in a note on Wednesday. ""Relief from debt service obligations owed to China could play a role in easing liquidity strains faced by a small subset of the countries eligible for the DSSI.""
China accounted for more than a quarter of the total external debt of DSSI-eligible countries, the International Institute of Finance (IIF) has estimated, making it the single largest bilateral creditor to those countries.
Some, including Kenya, have said they will not seek debt relief, fearing it could harm their ability to tap capital markets, while others, such as Angola, may agree more extensive relief than is envisaged under the initiative, Fitch said.

In the same speech last week, President Xi also said China will exempt some African countries from repaying zero-interest rate loans due by the end of 2020. Interest-free loans form only a small part of total bilateral debt owed to China for most countries, Fitch said.

This year, the coronavirus outbreak has brought those adventures in Kenya's Maasai Mara and Tanzania's Serengeti to a halt.
Like other African airlines, Safarilink Aviation grounded its planes in March after Kenya closed its borders and stopped air travel, part of efforts to curb the spread of the disease. 
""During this period, we carry, just going to the Mara, about 10,000 passengers per month,"" said Alex Avedi, Safarilink Aviation's CEO. ""As you can see all the aircraft are parked, there is no one going to see this magnificent spectacle.""
Safari lovers typically flock to the region hoping to witness hundreds of thousands of wildebeest that run the gauntlet of hungry crocodiles as they cross the Mara river in search of greener pastures on the Kenya-Tanzania border.
Across Africa, wildlife reserves and parks have closed their gates as tourists stay home, hitting the continent's multi-billion-dollar tourist industry and leading to job cuts and loss of income for thousands.
""There is a whole community around those conservancies that are definitely impacted and effected by (there being) no visitors. All the people who provide groceries, food, the guides, housekeeping, the barmen, its very unfortunate,"" Avedi told Reuters.
Many lodges outside Nairobi have been forced to close.
However, in the heart of Nairobi's National Park, one campsite run by safari company Gamewatchers reopened on June 12. The camp adheres to strict health guidelines, testing its staff for COVID-19 and checking visitors' temperature.
""The feeling that today we have opened up even with the conditions is great,"" said Joseph Lelenguya, the manager of Nairobi Tented Camp. 
Most of its visitors at the moment are people who live in Nairobi, like Pierre Chaumont, who moved to Kenya from France seven years ago. 
""We saw lions this morning, buffalo, wild ostrich,"" Chaumont told Reuters.

879,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 08:20AM ET</span>","High unemployment, lower immigration to restrain Canada housing market: Reuters poll","By Mumal Rathore
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Canadian house prices will rise at a much slower pace this year than predicted only three months ago and will fall in 2021 as the coronavirus pandemic pushes up unemployment, curtailing immigration and the demand for homes, a Reuters poll showed.
Lockdown restrictions to stop the spread of the virus, which has infected over 100,000 people in Canada, have disrupted supply chains in the resource-heavy economy.
Despite aggressive interest rate cuts from the Bank of Canada and emergency government spending, including help to furlough workers during lockdown, the economy is in its deepest recession on record.
While Canadian home prices rose 0.1% in the month of May, yielding the strongest annual gain in two years, the June 9-23 poll of 17 economists and housing market analysts showed average house prices across the country would rise just 1.5% this year compared with the 4.5% forecast in a March poll.
Buyers fearful for their economic future are less likely to make big-ticket purchases, pressuring sellers to lower prices. Unemployment hit a record high of 13.7% in May and may rise more as businesses plan their future.
""Hopefully unemployment will be low enough when most financial bridges and mortgage deferrals end,"" said Sebastien Lavoie in Montreal, chief economist at Laurentian Bank Securities, who expects that two-thirds of those currently jobless will be called back to work by the end of this year.
""A small but not negligible share of job losses recently will end up in long-term unemployment. Also, COVID-19 anxiety weighs down on labour market prospects, delaying housing purchases. A key risk specific for Canada is tied to the achievement of the federal immigration targets, which underpinned housing demand in recent years.""
In a worst-case scenario, Canadian house prices were forecast to tumble 8.0% this year, according to the poll. 
Next year, national house prices are forecast to fall 1.2%, compared with a 3.5% rise predicted in March.
Demand for housing this year is expected to fall across the country, including in Toronto and Vancouver, said more than three-quarters of respondents.
In Toronto, Canada's financial capital and largest city, house prices were expected to rise 3.0% this year compared with 6.4% predicted three months ago. In 2021, forecasts pointed to a fall of 3.1% versus a rise of 5.0% three months ago.
Vancouver house prices were expected to decline 1.8% this year compared with a 2.4% rise predicted in the last survey.
Asked how quickly Canadian housing market activity would recover to pre-COVID-19 levels, 12 of 17 analysts said it would be gradual. Three said it would be slow and long while the remaining two said activity had already recovered.
High employment was the biggest hurdle for the market over the coming year for most respondents, followed by low immigration, household debt levels, the lack of affordable housing and more stringent mortgage conditions.
""Employment ... will be influenced by our domestic handling of the pandemic, the quality of economic recovery among our key trading partners, and re-opening our borders to countries that are our primary sources of tourists and international students,"" said David Stroud, CEO at property advisory firm Mortgage Sandbox in Vancouver. 
""With so many conditions required to return to pre-COVID activity levels, it is likely the recovery will be slow, gradual, taking a few steps forward and sometimes a step back.""

880,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 08:09AM ET</span>","In Virus Hot Spots, Businesses Sweat Return of Consumer Jitters","(Bloomberg) -- The Wandering Tortoise taproom in Phoenix saw a flow of customers after the stay-at-home order ended last month. Then Covid-19 infections began to spike, turning the state into a new pandemic hot spot.
“You don’t see people out and about,” said Shay Gau, a co-owner of the 3 1/2-year-old business that also has a beer shop. “It was definitely busier right out of the gate. People were excited to get back out.”
In states from Arizona to Texas and Florida where Covid-19 is flaring up, small businesses like the Wandering Tortoise are seeing a slowdown, salons report that customers are getting more skittish, and some restaurants and bars had to shut down again after reopening. While evidence of a virus-sparked consumer pullback is largely anecdotal for now, it would be a setback for a U.S. economy that has just started to perk up, with retail sales jumping to a record in May.
Some states that reopened the earliest are now seeing thousands of new cases that threaten to overwhelm health systems. In Arizona, where President Donald Trump visited Tuesday, Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican, reversed his position on wearing face masks in public last week, allowing local governments to mandate them. In Texas, Governor Greg Abbott warned tougher actions will be required if hospitalizations continue to rise.
Some businesses in Florida, another hot spot, saw a sudden drop in activity.
Orlando hair salon owner Nadine Tarpley was personally handling as many as 20 clients a day after reopening last month. That has since declined to around five.“We have customers where they want to be the only person in the salon,” Tarpley said, adding that it isn’t sustainable. “We’re awful nervous that they could possibly close us back down again.”
That’s a stark turnaround for the owner of OhSoooJazzy Hair Salon, who was asked to host a salon reopening discussion last month with Ron DeSantis, the Republican Governor of Florida. Her business surged back after the state allowed barbershops and salons to reopen in mid-May, Tarpley said, briefly surpassing pre-pandemic levels as people starved for a cut or highlights rushed back.
Two hours to the west, Mark Ferguson operates Ferg’s Sports Bar in downtown St. Petersburg, a watering hole in the shadows of Tropicana Field, home of Major League Baseball’s Tampa Bay Rays. Months without live sports events on TV or at the nearby stadium have been a huge challenge, but his spacious outdoor patio at least has put some patrons at ease.
Things have trended down again after the recent spike in Florida, Ferguson said. St. Petersburg’s mayor has signed a new order requiring everyone to wear face coverings inside businesses in the city. Nearby, a popular outdoor music venue called Jannus Live shut down temporarily after a staffer got the virus.
“They were coming out, and all of a sudden about 10 days ago the news was saying everything was spiking in St. Pete,” Ferguson said.
A new survey by the National Federation of Independent Business underscored the improvement in demand for U.S. small businesses in May and early June: One-third of them reported sales volume that was greater than 75% of pre-recession levels.
Data from the OpenTable booking app also showed customers eager to get back to normal. Reservations in Arizona, Florida and Texas have rebounded to about 50% of their pre-pandemic levels, with restaurants in each state seeing a surge of business over the Father’s Day holiday. Each had been down to near zero from mid-March through April.
Little Greek Fresh Grill, a chain of fast-casual restaurants in Florida, Texas and the Midwest, is heavily geared toward take-out and has only seen a continuing rebound in recent months, company president Nick Vojnovic said. Meantime, economic indicators including the OpenTable booking data show little sign of softening so far, said Michael Skordeles, an economist at SunTrust Bank in Atlanta.
“I haven’t seen any data that looks like it’s hitting anything economically yet,” Skordeles said. “It’s a weird lot of mixed signals.”
But back in Yuma, Arizona, a border town that Trump visited Tuesday, restaurant manager Beverly Baker-DuBay has seen dwindling demand in recent days, out of concern about the spike in cases.
“When they first let us reopen, people were happy to come out,” she said. “In the last week or so, it has slowed down. People are scared.”The restaurant, Brownie’s Café, can accommodate 158 customers. It has been operating at half capacity, with only one of two cooks and reduced hours for hostesses. It has scrapped two daily specials and mostly does take-out.
“People are ordering food to go,” said Baker-DuBay. “They feel safer that way.”
Concerns are spreading across the nation as businesses are forced to close down again. On Tuesday, wine distributor Harry Root got word that six of his restaurant clients in Alabama were shutting because of the virus, although he was unclear whether employees had gotten sick or the restaurateurs feared for their workers’ health.
“For them, it’s awful,” said Root, whose business, Grassroots Wine, distributes in Alabama and South Carolina. “For us, it’s not good.”

""In connection with this review, the U.S. Trade Representative is considering modifying the list of products of certain current or former EU member States that currently are subject to additional duties,"" the filing posted late on Tuesday said. 
The review stems from the United States' dispute with the European Union involving Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) and U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA), it said.
The World Trade Organization previously found the world's two largest planemakers received billions of dollars of unfair subsidies, and last year allowed the United States to levy tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of EU goods, including aircraft, wines and cheese in response to Airbus subsidies deemed illegal. 
The notice, first reported by Bloomberg, was posted on the USTR website and is set to be formally published in the Federal Register on Friday.
The USTR said it said it may modify duties on a range of EU products, including maintaining current tariffs or increasing them, and was weighing tariffs on other products from Britain, France, Spain and Germany that have an approximate value of $3.1 billion.

The WTO is also considering granting the EU similar tariff rights regarding support it deemed illegal for Boeing.

882,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 06:31AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday, June 24th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- New infections of Covid-19 are running at record rates across a swath of the U.S., and markets are – belatedly, some would argue - reacting negatively. The International Monetary Fund is due to update its growth forecasts for the world later.  Stocks are set to open lower and gold is within touching distance of $1,800 an ounce for the first time in eight years, as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin talks up another extension to the 2019 tax deadline. And the government will publish its weekly report on the state of U.S. oil supplies after an industry survey suggested crude stockpiles rose again last week. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, June 24th.
1. Virus surge raises risk of fresh lockdowns; EU mulls ban on U.S. arrivals
The rise in new Covid-19 infections in many states across the U.S. is gathering pace, raising the risk of renewed lockdowns to bring it under control again.  Texas, Arizona and California all reported record numbers of new infections on Tuesday.
Some 29 U.S. states now have a reproduction rate (so-called R-number) of over 1, a level that ensures the virus spreads exponentially. Hospitalizations are also rising rapidly – a fact that undermines claims that rising infection rates are simply a result of broader testing.
In Europe later, ministers are expected to announce a ban on arrivals from the U.S.
The virus continues to spread rapidly across Latin America too, with Mexico also recording a record number of new infections and 793 deaths. The Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, meanwhile, has been hospitalized and is receiving oxygen, according to reports.
2. Mnuchin talks up new stimulus package, tax deadline extension
U.S. Treasury Secretary said the administration is “seriously considering” another package of economic support measures and may extend again the deadline for filing 2019 tax returns.
“We want to take our time because, number one, there’s a lot of money we still haven’t put out, and, number two, we want to make sure whatever we do…is much more targeted to the businesses that are most impacted” by the virus, Bloomberg quoted Mnuchin as saying at a conference it organized.
The tax deadline has already been pushed back once from April to the end of July.
3. Stocks set to open lower; Winnebago in the spotlight 
U.S. stocks are set to open lower, as investors finally take on board the threat of the rising tide of new infections.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract was down 270 points, or 1.0%, while the S&P 500 Futures was down 0.9% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 0.6%.
Of note later will be the latest update from Winnebago Industries (NYSE:WGO), whose stock has tripled on speculation that disruption to the travel business will spur demand for its recreational vehicles.
European stocks also turned sharply lower as fears that the U.S. could succumb to a second wave of infections outweighed a sharp rise in the German Ifo Business Climate index. The benchmark Stoxx 600 lost 1.7%.
With the exception of an isolated outbreak in the German meat-packing industry, infections have not risen noticeably in Europe since lockdown restrictions were lifted last month.
4. Gold hits 8-year high
The price of gold hit another eight-year high as the latest wave of coronavirus fears drove investors to place more bets on what is usually a haven asset.
By 6:30 AM, gold futures for delivery on the Comex exchange were up 0.7% at $1,794.80, after hitting an overnight high of $1,796.10 an ounce. Its latest rally has come at a time when other havens such as U.S. Treasury bonds have been relatively range-bound, reflecting the belief that gold is a better-value haven at a time when both nominal and real interest rates have tumbled.
Central banks around the world are still adding monetary stimulus where they can: the Bank of Japan, European Central Bank and Bank of England all increased their quantitative easing programs earlier this month against a backdrop of collapsing global growth.
The International Monetary Fund will later update its forecasts for the global economy in an update of its World Economic Outlook.
5. Crude gets the Covid-19 jitters; U.S. oil stocks eyed
U.S. crude oil prices caught the Covid-19 jitters, falling back below $40 on concerns that a new wave of infections will derail the current recovery in demand.
By 6:30, WTI futures were down 1.4% at $39.78, while the global benchmark Brent was down 1.0% at $42.19.
Prices have been under pressure since the American Petroleum Institute reported a 1.7 million barrel increase in U.S. crude stocks on Tuesday afternoon. The U.S. government’s official data are due at 10:30 AM. A rise of 300,000 barrels in crude inventories is expected.

883,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>","UK airports warn 20,000 jobs at risk as travel slump continues","LONDON (Reuters) - Up to 20,000 jobs could go at Britain's airports, an industry group warned, calling on the government to do more to help an aviation industry that was shut down by the COVID pandemic and is now struggling to restart due to quarantine rules. 
The Airport Operators Association (AOA), which represents more than 50 airports, said future passenger numbers at UK airports were expected to be significantly lower, and analysis of its members suggested up to 20,000 jobs were at risk.
The government should scrap its quarantine regime, provide relief from business rates, extend a job retention scheme, directly fund the sector regulator and suspend air passenger taxes to help save jobs, the AOA said.
""These jobs figures clearly show that a key component of the UK’s infrastructure is on its knees, with no relief to the current crisis expected,"" said AOA chief executive Karen Dee.
""Government needs to recognise the immense crisis facing the country’s airport communities and take action to support UK aviation and protect livelihoods.""
UK-based airlines British Airways (L:ICAG), Virgin Atlantic and easyJet (L:EZJ) have already announced close to 20,000 job losses between them. The country's biggest airport Heathrow has also started a voluntary redundancy scheme.
Britain has a 14-day quarantine policy in place for arrivals into the country from abroad, which airlines, airports and the hospitality sector have said is deterring international travel at a time when they had been hoping for it to recover. 

The rule is due to be reviewed on June 29, three weeks after it was introduced and could be replaced by ""air bridges"", which would allow restriction-free travel between countries with low infection rates.

884,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 05:54AM ET</span>","U.S. Eyes $3.1 Billion of EU, U.K. Imports for New Tariffs","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. is weighing new tariffs on $3.1 billion of exports from France, Germany, Spain and the U.K., adding to an arsenal the Trump administration is threatening to use against Europe that could spiral into a wider transatlantic trade fight later this summer.
The U.S. Trade Representative wants to impose new tariffs on European exports like olives, beer, gin and trucks, while increasing duties on products including aircrafts, cheese and yogurt, according to a notice published late Tuesday evening. The statement lays out a month-long public comment period ending July 26.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index, which tracks leading companies in the euro area, extended a decline on the news, slumping 2% at 11:26 a.m. in Brussels. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 hit intraday lows.
If the U.S. follows through with its plan, it could hammer European luxury brands like Givenchy and Hermes -- which produce leather goods -- and Remy Cointreau and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), which make cognac and champagne. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton would be particularly vulnerable because it produces a wide array of these products.
Tariffs on British gin could increase U.S. prices at peak season for gin-and-tonics, potentially hurting British spirits companies like  Diageo  (LON:DGE) Plc, the London-based maker of Tanqueray; James Burrough, the maker of Beefeater gin; and William Grant & Sons, the maker of Hendricks gin.
German Beer
New U.S. duties might also dampen demand for German beer ahead of any Oktoberfest celebrations that aren’t already canceled because of the coronavirus.
The addtional import taxes would already add to the 25% tariff the U.S. imposed last year on imports of Scotch and Irish Whisky and liqueurs and cordials from Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and U.K.
The Distilled Spirits Council in the U.S. said it opposed any additional spirits tariffs, which would “escalate trade tensions across the Atlantic and further jeopardize American companies and hospitality jobs already under duress as a result of COVID-19,” according to a statement.
The move is related to Europe and America’s 15-year-old World Trade Organization aircraft subsidy fight. A couple of years ago the Geneva-based trade arbiter said both the U.S. and the EU were guilty of illegally supporting their respective aircraft industries.
In October the U.S. gained the upper hand when the WTO authorized President Donald Trump to retaliate against $7.5 billion worth of EU exports in response to Europe’s illegal subsidies to Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY). Next month the WTO is expected to deliver a retaliation award to the EU in its separate but related case against U.S. subsidies to the Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.
Carousel of Pain
In the meantime, Trump’s top trade official, Robert Lighthizer, has sought to increase pressure on the Europeans by deploying a particularly damaging tactic called “carousel retaliation,” whereby a country periodically shifts tariffs on different groups of goods.
Tuesday’s USTR notice is a reminder that the U.S.’s tariff targets may shift or be subject to higher levies -- a strategy that spreads the sanctions pain across an array of industries, creating uncertainty for businesses and headaches for exporters and importers alike.
Earlier this year the U.S. deployed its carousel retaliation strategy to increase tariffs on exports of Airbus aircraft and parts from 10% to 15%. To date the U.S. has only deployed tariffs on goods worth about half of its permitted retaliation levels.
Lighthizer said his goal in increasing tariffs is to persuade the EU to agree to a settlement. But talks between the U.S. and the EU have floundered this year, and now the EU is preparing to retaliate with new tariffs against an array of politically sensitive U.S. industries.
Stalled Talks
“The U.S. has stepped back from the settlement talks in recent weeks,” EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan told European trade ministers on June 9. “If this remains the case, the EU will have little choice but to exercise its retaliation rights and impose our own sanctions.”
The EU has asked the WTO to give it the green light to place levies on as much as $11.2 billion worth of U.S. exports to Europe in retaliation for America’s illegal subsidies to Boeing. The Trump administration argues the WTO award will be much smaller, with only about $300 million at stake.
Regardless of the level of the WTO award, the U.S. is now preparing to hit more European products as a means to dissuade the EU from retaliating at all.
“There is no valid basis for the EU to retaliate against any U.S. goods,” Lighthizer said last month. “We will continue to press the EU to negotiate a resolution that respects the WTO’s findings.”

The three-month loans will be extended on Thursday through Dec. 25, the central bank said.
Wednesday's market operation was the first to be offered since the BOJ combined several facilities in May to create a single lending programme aimed at pumping money to pandemic-hit firms via financial institutions.
The central bank has said it expects the amount of money to be pumped out via the programme to eventually reach 110 trillion yen.
The BOJ eased monetary policy in March and April, pledging to buy more assets, gobble up unlimited amounts of government debt and create lending facilities to channel money to firms.
The number of participants surged to 180 from just 18 in March, after the BOJ decided to pay a 0.1% interest to financial institutions that tapped the programme - effectively subsidising them for taking up loans from the central bank.

886,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 04:50AM ET</span>","Don't get too excited by solid euro zone data, ECB's Lane says","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Solid data may not be a good guide to how the euro zone is recovering from its deepest economic crisis in living memory, European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane said on Wednesday, cooling expectations after some surprisingly strong figures.
Having bottomed out in April, the bloc's economy is reviving as restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus are gradually lifted. Unexpectedly strong PMI and Ifo numbers have raised hopes for a relatively quick, 'V shaped' recovery.
But Lane said that while ""substantial improvement"" in near-term indicators was normal given the depth of the contraction, this was not a good guide to the future, and activity would remain far below pre-crisis levels for an extended period given lingering restrictions.
""Income losses and precautionary savings continue to weigh on consumption,"" he said. ""Likewise, weak demand, continued supply constraints and ongoing social distancing restrictions are hampering the normalisation of economic activity.""
Still, Lane said he is getting more confident that a spill of negative inflation readings, expected by some because of crashing oil prices, could be avoided.
""The measures we’re taking and also the fiscal measures should keep inflation in positive territory,"" Lane said. ""We may be more optimistic that negative inflation can be avoided.""
Lane added fiscal measures, particularly talks over a 750 billion euro ($847 billion) EU recovery package, were also likely to have a major impact on how quickly confidence rebounded.
""The outcome of negotiations about the EU recovery fund will be an important factor in determining the future path for the euro area economy,"" Lane added.
The ECB was determined to support this recovery and it could even cut interest rates, though such a move might prove ineffective because longer-term sovereign yields become virtually unresponsive to rate cuts in stressed conditions.
""While we stand ready to cut policy rates in the future as market conditions normalise and if warranted by the medium-term inflation outlook, this evidence tilts the balance towards asset purchases as the more efficient tool in current circumstances,"" Lane added.

887,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2020 03:51AM ET</span>",Europe's emergency loan schemes stir fears of a debt trap,"By Valentina Za, Maya Nikolaeva and Jesús Aguado
MILAN/PARIS/MADRID (Reuters) - Michele Berteramo, owner of the Movida restaurant and cocktail bar on Milan's Naviglio Pavese canal, had been about to spend 40,000 euros ($45,270) on renovations when the new coronavirus pandemic struck northern Italy. 
Instead he burnt through the cash keeping his business afloat during lockdown. Movida reopened on May 18, but is struggling to break even as crowds stay away from the popular nightlife district.
""We've been able to skip rent payments, but it can't last forever ... we are going to need bank financing to operate,"" said the 46-year-old restaurateur. 
Berteramo has tapped Italy's emergency government guaranteed loan scheme to help pay his bills, but if he wants to press on with his renovation plans, he will need to take on even more debt, in a shrinking economy, to do so. 
His conundrum is a long-term concern for governments and banks across Europe, which are rushing to prop up struggling companies, but are worried that the increased debt levels will hinder their ability to invest in growth. 
Credit to non-financial companies in the euro zone hit an 11-year-high in April, European Central Bank (ECB) data show. According to Reuters calculations, more than 290 billion euros of loans in government-backed lending schemes have been granted across the European Union's four largest economies and Britain during the continuing coronavirus slump. 
""If European Union growth only returns to its pre-COVID growth rate, after today's sizeable shock, Europe will be left looking at a Japan-like future,"" said UBS credit strategist Stephen Caprio, referring to years of stagnation in Japan as surging debt combined with deflation to hobble the economy in the 1990s and 2000s.
""European firms already had too much leverage. This will naturally stifle business investment"".
Underscoring concerns that such a scenario might become reality, central bankers are already flagging the twin threat of debt and deflation. ""The high levels of public and private debt in the euro area as a whole ... could trigger a dangerous spiral between the fall in prices and that in aggregate demand,"" ECB Governing Council member Ignazio Visco said in a speech at the end of May.
Core debt to private non-financial companies in the euro area represented 165% of the region's gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of 2019 according to latest figures from the Bank for International Settlements, compared to 150% in the United States. The European ratio is set to climb still higher following this year's loan splurge.
The problem is particularly acute at small and medium enterprises (SME), which account for around two thirds of private sector jobs in the 27-nation European Union but lack the ability to directly access capital markets unlike their larger peers.
FROM DEBT TO EQUITY
Policymakers are discussing options for getting more equity, rather than debt, into businesses but few countries have ready-made vehicles for funnelling mass investment into SMEs.
While several governments have set aside funds for capital injections into large companies, they are having to think up innovative options for smaller firms. 
""The aid to businesses will need to be redirected from loans in Act One to part-equity ... the choices are complex, costly and part of the political debate,"" Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said in an opinion piece in Le Figaro newspaper on April 24.
The European Union has estimated that companies will need 720 billion euros in solvency support in 2020 alone and aims to activate around 300 billion euros of investment through guaranteeing and supplementing private sector investment. 
That could provide longer-term support for medium-sized businesses although there are caveats - priority will be given to companies that fit with the EU's broader goals of improving digital technology and shifting towards a greener economy.   
""It will be difficult to obtain these funds for traditional industries,"" said Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo, a former European Central Bank policymaker from Spain, adding that smaller businesses will be unlikely to attract much of this cash. 
It is only ""once they grow they're on the radar. You can't imagine a fund investing in bars for example"", he told Reuters. 
    
INCOMING CALLS
French investment company Tikehau Capital, which focuses on medium-sized companies, is eyeing opportunities.
""We are getting more and more calls, many from the 100% family-owned businesses in Spain, Germany, England,"" said Mathieu Chabran, Tikehau's co-founder. 
""They are worried their leverage levels could double so feel it now might not be such a bad idea to let in a financial investor with long-term capital.""
Tikehau manages around 25.4 billion euros in assets – but there are a limited number of investors of that scale operating in the small-to-medium sector. 
In Britain - which has one of the region's most developed capital markets - financial lobby group CityUK estimates the level of equity raised by small and medium businesses in the past two years is 7.2 billion pounds ($9.00 billion). The group also forecasts that 32-36 billion pounds worth of loans taken out by companies using the government's emergency loan schemes will be ""unsustainable"" by the end of the first quarter of 2021.
Backed by the Bank of England, CityUK launched a ""recapitalisation"" project to examine how private equity, insurers and pension funds could invest more into SMEs.
""This is a huge and complicated challenge,"" said CityUK chief executive Miles Celic. ""There won't be a one-size fits all solution. We need a range of viable options ... and many different types of investors."" 
It is examining new types of instruments for encouraging SME investment ranging from straight forward share purchases to ""profit participating debt"" - a type of loan that is treated more like equity on a balance sheet and whose repayments would be linked to profits. 
In France, central bank head Villeroy has said a similar instrument, known as 'prets participatifs', could be adapted to help SMEs. 
Italy is planning to offer tax breaks both to small firms that boost their capital and to investors who offer up their cash to help such companies.
Fondo Italiano d'Investimento - a fund backed by the state lender CDP - is preparing to launch an 800 million euro pot to take minority stakes in Italian firms with revenues of 20-250 million euros. 
Most such schemes and instruments will require a degree of government backing - although that in itself can be a problem.  
Germany has set aside 100 billion euros for equity investments in troubled companies, but it has barely been touched to date. Banks have blamed Berlin for attaching too onerous conditions - such as controls on salaries - saying it is encouraging businesses to turn instead to more debt.
With lockdowns only recently starting to ease across much of Europe, bankers also say many companies, particularly SMEs, are unlikely to be focused on capital raising yet. 
But as debt repayment holidays start to expire and the availability of emergency loans tails off, late 2020 and early 2021 is likely to be when companies will need the option of fresh capital. 
""We need programmes to be launched as soon as possible so funds arrive in time,"" said Carlos Torres, chairman of Spain's second biggest bank BBVA (MC:BBVA) at a conference put on by the country's main business lobby last week.  
""Coming late may, in many cases, mean not coming"". 
Milanese restaurant owner Berteramo has used up his first 25,000 euro state-backed loan and is awaiting a second tranche which will be underwritten by the local region. ""We’ve got nothing but debt right now ... I am beginning to get a bit worried,"" he said.
As things stand, the only simple way to raise more equity would be to take on a business partner, which doesn't appeal. ""The fewer people running a restaurant the better it is,"" he said.

The Washington D.C.-based lender agreed last week to spend $800 million on primary-school education and another $200 million on maternal and infant health in the country. President Felix Tshisekedi, who took over Congo last year after 18 years of rule by Joseph Kabila, has made free education his signature policy initiative.
Its implementation has been hampered by lower-than-expected revenue, due in part to the Covid-19 pandemic and a government paralyzed by in-fighting between Tshisekedi and Kabila’s allies who still control most of the country’s institutions.
“It’s the biggest project ever approved by the World Bank in Democratic Republic of Congo,” Jean-Christophe Carret, the World Bank country director for Congo, told Bloomberg in an interview on June 17. “Our support for free primary school, it isn’t to support President Tshisekedi, but because we think it’s a very good measure to improve human capital.”
Five Years
Congo has the third-highest number of people living in extreme poverty, after India and Nigeria, and the average child receives less than five years of schooling, according to the bank.
The free education initiative will cost Congo $1 billion a year and the World Bank will provide about 25% of that over the next three years. Thereafter the government should be able to afford the program on its own despite the fallout from the pandemic, Carret said.
Carret praised the government’s handling of the coronavirus response thus far, but cautioned that the pandemic isn’t weakening. Congo had 6,027 known cases of Covid-19 and 135 deaths through Monday.
While Congo will have about $100 million in debt service postponed or canceled by creditors this year due to the pandemic, the World Bank won’t be offering debt relief, Carret said. The bank provides financing for the country at highly concessional rates and a large part of the funds come in the form of grants, he said.
“We think it’s a very good deal for the country,” Carret said. Congo has one of the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios in Africa, according to the World Bank.

The nominations process began earlier this month to find a successor to Brazilian Roberto Azevedo, who will vacate the post a year early at the end of August.
""The international community is increasingly becoming more protectionist...in order for the WTO to overcome the current crisis, the role of a middle power to mediate conflicts among member states is important,"" Yoo said in a statement ahead of a press conference.
""Korea will be able to serve as a bridge, based on its growth experience through trade.""
Yoo is the first woman to hold the position of South Korea's trade minister since it was created in 1948, and if selected, would be the first female WTO director-general.
Yoo, 53, led South Korea's renegotiation of a trade deal with the United States and worked on South Korea's trade pacts with Singapore and ASEAN.
Earlier this month, South Korea resumed a WTO dispute process with Japan over export curbs on some high-tech materials, saying talks to resolve the dispute, born out of a deterioration in bilateral relations last year, had failed to make progress.

South Korea relies much on foreign trade, with exports and imports taking up 63.7% of its 2019 nominal GDP, according to Korea International Trade Association data.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan can spend time examining the effects of the stimulus steps put in place since March, a board member said in a June rate review, underscoring BOJ's view it has done enough for now to cushion the blow from the coronavirus pandemic.
Another member of the board said while the BOJ must use ""all available tools boldly"" to combat the pandemic, it can do so under the crisis-response framework already put in place, a summary of opinions showed on Wednesday.
""The current monetary easing framework is flexible, in that it is highly adaptable to various changes in developments,"" one member was quoted as saying.
""Now that we've laid out sufficient schemes to respond to the pandemic, it's desirable to carefully examine their effects for the time being,"" said another opinion in the summary.
The BOJ eased policy in March and April, mainly by boosting asset buying and creating lending schemes to channel funds to companies hit by slumping sales amid the pandemic.
Its crisis-response framework consists of three components - facilities to pump money to firms via financial institutions, huge yen supply via government bond buying, and aggressive purchases of risky assets to soothe market jitters.
Some board members, however, were concerned about the risk that Japan may slip back into deflation as the pandemic wreaks havoc on an already weakening economy.
""An increase in corporate bankruptcies ... could hurt jobs, inflation and financial conditions. We need to ensure Japan doesn't return to deflation,"" one member said.
The BOJ kept monetary policy steady in June.

The BOJ releases a summary of opinions from the nine board members several days after each rate review. It does not disclose the identity of the member who made the comments.

The rating company downgraded the sovereign a notch lower to Ba3 -- three levels into its non-investment grade scale, and changed its outlook to negative, according to a statement Tuesday. In March, Moody’s put Oman on review for the downgrade, saying the country’s low fiscal strength will likely place pressure on its finances. Its assessment is now on par with S&P Global Ratings and one level below that of Fitch Ratings.
“The downgrade reflects the conclusion that in a lower oil price environment, which Moody’s now assumes will persist into the medium term, the government will unlikely be able to significantly offset the oil revenue loss and avoid a large and durable deterioration in its debt and debt affordability metrics or erosion of its fiscal and foreign currency buffers,” according to the statement.
Moody’s has revised its Brent crude price assumptions for 2020 and 2021 to an average of $35 per barrel and $45 respectively.
The biggest Arab oil exporter outside OPEC, Oman was considered to be one of the most vulnerable economies in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council even before the dual crisis. At the same time, its long-standing neutrality on regional and international issues have given it a special identity.
This year, Oman trimmed its budget expenditure and announced liquidity support in an effort to provide some relief from the Covid-19 shock. It has also discussed the possibility of financial aid from wealthier neighbors, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg.
The Gulf sovereign still has access to a relatively robust stock of liquid fiscal and foreign currency reserves, according to Moody’s; and, its scope to slow the pace of balance sheet deterioration can be done through spending and revenue measures as well as willingness from neighboring countries to extend support.

Sudan said earlier in June that it began talks with the IMF on a non-funded programme that could pave the way for international financial support.
Khartoum is in desperate need of financial help to reorganise its economy. Inflation has been exceeding 100% and the currency tumbling as the government prints money to subsidise bread, fuel and electricity.
With Sudan's economy at risk of freefall, the government is pinning its hopes on a conference of potential donors in Berlin this week.
An IMF mission led by Daniel Kanda held virtual meetings with the Sudanese authorities from 8-21 June to discuss their reform package.
""The Sudanese authorities and IMF staff have reached a staff-level agreement on policies and reforms that can underpin an SMP (staff-monitored program), subject to approval by the IMF's management and Executive Board,"" the statement quoted Kanda as saying at the end of the mission.
""The SMP aims at narrowing large macroeconomic imbalances, reducing structural distortions that hamper economic activity and job creation, strengthening governance and social safety nets, and making progress towards eventual (Heavily Indebted Poor Country) HIPC debt relief,"" he added.
Sudan presented a package that includes ""reforming energy subsidies to create room for increased spending on social programs,"" the IMF said on Tuesday.
Until now Sudan has been unable to tap the IMF or the World Bank for support because it is still listed by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism and has $1.3 billion of IMF arrears.

Almost 40% of the funds budgeted for cash handouts to households still haven’t reached people despite their approval in late April, according to Japan’s internal affairs ministry citing figures to the end of last week.
As for business loans and job-protection subsidies, other key measures in Abe’s $2.2 trillion package, only 14% of around $920 billion earmarked for smaller firms has been lent out and just 5.8% of aid to companies maintaining their payrolls.
The upshot is that even with the best of intentions, Japan’s government is falling short of the speedy assistance it promised as the economy faces its biggest contraction in more than six decades.
Ayana Amaike, a 32-year-old freelance translator living in Tokyo, was infuriated when three tax bills arrived in her mailbox while she waited more than two weeks just for an acknowledgment that her application form for financial support had been filed.
“It may sound like an ungrateful complaint, but I can’t honestly say I rate the government’s speed of delivery,” said Amaike, whose typical work is converting the fine detail of Japanese electronics and machinery patents into English.
Amaike applied for a program offering up to 1 million yen to freelancers or 2 million yen for small businesses that can show a sharp loss of income.
Kazuko Ito, a nightclub hostess in Tokyo said she also applied for assistance through the program three weeks ago but, unlike Amaike who has now received the money, Ito said she is still waiting for a response.
The 56-year-old said she couldn’t get through to the government’s helpline and ended up having to get a younger friend’s help to navigate the website.
“You call a hundred times and nobody answers,” she said. “It’s the worst.”
Universal Cash
Japan’s main cash handout program offers each person 100,000 yen after an earlier plan to target the aid was scrapped over fears it would be delivered too slowly. Instead, the 13 trillion yen measure has itself come under fire for delays and technological slow-footedness.
“The speed is slow,” said economist Harumi Taguchi at IHS Markit, comparing Japan’s performance with other major economies. “I suspect the aid hasn’t really gotten to the people who needed it most, when they needed it most.”
South Korea, which approved similar handouts to all households on the same day as Japan, has essentially finished handing out the cash already. Korea reached the 90% distribution mark more than a month ago as it made better use of a high-tech infrastructure less bound by legacy systems.
In Virus Relief, Tech-Savvy Korea Beats Paperwork-Heavy Japan
Failure to fully harness the benefits of a national identification number has been cited as a factor slowing down applications for the cash. Another factor may simply be a lack of staff to handle claims.
In Setagaya, Tokyo’s largest ward with over 900,000 people, only 15% of households that applied for the cash had received their handout as of Friday.
On the small island of Nao in west Japan, famed for its art museums and Tadao Ando architecture, 97% of 3,000 eligible islanders had received the handout as of Monday.
“Japan has one of the smallest governments internationally. Overall operations are extraordinarily slow because they’re cut to the bone,” said Martin Schulz, chief policy economist at Fujitsu Ltd.
Many local governments including Tokyo’s Chofu city had to stop online applications for the cash handouts as it was taking so much time to confirm details with incomplete applications or households filing multiple requests.
The limitations of Japan’s government apparatus revealed by the coronavirus should serve as an enormous incentive to drive digitalization and reform, Schulz added.
Japan announced plans Tuesday to upgrade the country’s digital infrastructure.
“Because the response has been slow, there are people who have gone out of business,” said Nobuyasu Atago, economist at Okasan Securities. “We’ll have to wait and see how many people have gone bust.”
While bankruptcy rates have not shot up yet, the number of people idled has. In April, another 4.2 million people were on leave compared with the month before. Some 143,380 applications for the furlough program have been accepted from companies so far.
Japan’s Ultralow Jobless Rate Ignores 4 Million People on Leave
Setsuo Yokoyama, a 73-year old owner of a small metal working business near Nagoya that makes parts for barbecue grills, applied for one of the virus-response loans in late May. He received the 20 million yen loan last week, and has three years to pay it back.
Yokoyama said it was safer to have money on hand because it could be months before the return of anything like normal business.
“I was happy to keep plugging away until this happened,” said Yokoyama. “But all of this trouble has made me think it’s time to call it quits.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump temporarily suspended the entry into the United States of certain foreign workers on Monday despite strong opposition from business groups, including major tech companies.
The ban (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-workers/trump-suspends-entry-of-certain-foreign-workers-despite-business-opposition-idUSKBN23T2ZW), which the White House said was necessary to make jobs available for Americans, will go into effect on Wednesday and last until the end of 2020.
WHICH VISA CATEGORIES ARE BLOCKED?
- H-1B visas for skilled workers, which are often used by the tech industry
- L visas for executives, managers and specialized workers being transferred within a company
- H-2B visas for seasonal workers, many of which are in the landscaping business
- J visas for cultural exchange, including interns, trainees, teachers, camp counselors, au pairs and people participating in a summer work travel program
The proclamation also blocks family members who would accompany workers on such visas.
DOES THE TEMPORARY BAN APPLY TO VALID VISA HOLDERS?
Foreign workers already in the United States with a valid visa will not be affected. People outside the United States with valid visas and travel documents also will be exempt from the suspension, according to the proclamation.
A spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said the proclamation would not prevent a visa holder inside the United States from extending the visa duration or changing to a different type of visa.
Whether people with these types of visas outside the United States will be able to renew visas and travel documents was not immediately clear. 
ARE THERE OTHER EXEMPTIONS?
The proclamation excludes spouses and children of U.S. citizens. 
Foreigners working in the food supply industry will be exempted.
The proclamation also exempts the entry of foreign workers whose admission is deemed to be ""in the national interest.""
The visa suspension narrows an exemption for medical workers made by Trump in April to include only people working on research into the novel coronavirus and those involved in health care for COVID-19 patients.
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL BE BLOCKED BY THE PROCLAMATION?
The Washington-based Migration Policy Institute estimates that 167,000 workers and their dependents would be blocked between July 1 and Dec. 31, including 72,000 with J-1 visas and 29,000 with H-1B visas.
WHICH COUNTRIES WILL BE MOST AFFECTED?
The vast majority of H-1B visas - one of the more high-profile categories affected - go to people from India and China. 
Indians made up 72 percent of the approximately 388,000 H-1B visa petitions approved in fiscal year 2019, which began on Oct. 1, 2018, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data. Chinese applicants were 13 percent of the total.
WHICH WORK VISAS ARE NOT COVERED?
The most notable exempted category of temporary work visas are H-2A visas for agricultural workers. The proclamation does not affect a number of smaller non-immigrant work visas categories, including O visas for people of ""extraordinary ability or achievement.""

“It’s something we’re very seriously considering,” Mnuchin said Tuesday in an interview during the Bloomberg Invest Global virtual event. He said he expects the U.S. economy to exit recession by year’s end.
President Donald Trump has said he’s considering sending another round of economic stimulus payments in a rescue package that he expects will be released “over the next couple of weeks.” Stocks rose Tuesday on optimism for more stimulus.
The Trump administration has privately discussed a $1 trillion measure as a way to stimulate jobs growth after the Covid-19 pandemic.
Trump signed a $2.2 trillion stimulus into law in late March that’s provided payroll support to small businesses, $1,200 direct payments to families and boosted unemployment checks for millions of people out of work. The small business program’s initial $350 billion was later retopped with $310 billion.
The stimulus came after stay-at-home orders and social distancing measures were put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The virus has killed more than 120,000 people in the U.S. and put millions of people out of work.

899,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 02:50PM ET</span>","Virus fallout forces U.S. cities to cut budgets, projects: survey","CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. cities are laying off workers, shelving infrastructure projects and delaying or canceling equipment purchases as the economic fallout from the cornonavirus outbreak ravages their budgets and federal funds remain elusive, a survey released on Tuesday showed.
With cities facing a projected $360 billion revenue loss over the next three years, the National League of Cities' survey of more than 1,100 municipalities found that 74% have started to cut their budgets, with 20% reporting across-the-board reductions. 
""American cities, towns and villages are facing a double whammy,"" Matt Zone, a Cleveland City Council member, told reporters in a conference call. ""We have mounting expenses related to the pandemic while tax revenues are declining."" 
Nearly two-thirds of the survey respondents said they are delaying or canceling infrastructure projects as well as equipment purchases like police cars and garbage trucks.
""What we need now is certainty, especially given that local economies are what drives the national economy. There's definitely a ripple effect,"" said Joe Buscaino, Los Angeles Council president pro tempore and National League of Cities president.
League officials said nearly 70% of cities have not received any of the $150 billion earmarked for state and local government virus-related expenses in the federal CARES Act, which only provided direct funding to the nation's 36 largest municipalities, leaving the rest relying on allocations from their states or counties. The group is pushing for $500 billion in direct and flexible federal funding for all cities, although the outlook for passage in a divided Congress is unclear. 
On the jobs front, 32% of cities are eyeing furloughs or layoffs, while 41% have or will institute a hiring freeze, the survey found.

Local government employment, excluding education, fell by just over 500,000 jobs in April and May, according to the U.S. Labor Department.

LONDON (Reuters) - Lawyers for the founder of collapsed private equity firm Abraaj Group are urging a British court to refuse his extradition to the United States on fraud charges, arguing London was the nexus of the firm's business and so he should stand trial there.
Arif Naqvi, whose extradition hearing started this week, is among several people charged by U.S. prosecutors with being part of an international scheme to defraud investors including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Naqvi has previously denied the charges through a public relations firm.
Lawyers for Naqvi, currently out on bail in Britain, said U.S. authorities intended to rely extensively on the evidence of his co-accused Sev Vettivettipillai, a former managing director of Abraaj, who was based in the United Kingdom.
Dubai-based Abraaj was the largest buyout fund in the Middle East and North Africa until it collapsed in 2018 after investors raised concerns about the management of its $1 billion healthcare fund.
The Pakistani's lawyers argued the extradition request should be refused as a substantial part of Naqvi's activity central to the U.S. allegations was based in London, including Abraaj's investor coverage team, in addition to his family ties to the city.
""If the group had a beating heart it was in Dubai, but its mind and control was wherever Arif was, which was often in London, which is where the main investor coverage operation was,"" the defence's skeleton argument quoted Adnan Siddiqui, Abraaj's former general counsel, as saying.
If extradited, the document said there were grounds for believing Naqvi might be detained before a U.S. trial.
In New York, he might be held in either the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) or the Metropolitan Detention Centre (MDC), the defence said, adding conditions would be incompatible with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
If convicted in the United States, the document noted Naqvi was most likely to be sentenced to over 30 years' imprisonment and could begin serving that sentence in a high security institution.

901,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>","Trump threat to 'decouple' U.S. and China hits trade, investment reality","By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Conflicting talk from Trump administration officials about ""decoupling"" the U.S. economy from China is running into challenging reality: Chinese imports of U.S. goods are rising, investment by American companies into China continues, and markets are wary of separating the world's biggest economies. 
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro gave Asian markets a scare on Monday night by telling Fox News Channel that the U.S.-China trade deal was ""over."" U.S. stock futures dropped, the dollar rose, and volatility indices climbed. 
Navarro quickly backtracked on Monday night, saying he was referring to a lack of trust between the United States and China over the coronavirus outbreak. President Donald Trump also quickly tweeted that the deal was intact. 
On Tuesday, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow praised Beijing, telling Fox Business Network ""they've actually picked up their game"" when it comes to the trade deal. 
The damage-control efforts by the Trump administration come after Trump said last week that ""a complete decoupling from China"" was an option, overruling U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who had told lawmakers that decoupling was not realistic.
The Trump re-election campaign has made being ""tough on China"" a key part of his platform (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-election/blame-china-remake-economy-trump-pivots-to-new-election-message-amid-pandemic-idUSKBN22J1GT). The White House has blamed Beijing for the spread of the coronavirus that has killed more than 120,000 Americans, more than any other country. 
(See a graphic https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-USA/0100B5K8423/index.html of the spread of the coronavirus in the United States)
But part of that message - that the United States is able and willing to walk away from its largest supplier - is challenged by on-the-ground realities. 
U.S.-China trade is actually increasing, after the coronavirus caused major drops shortly after the trade deal was signed in January. U.S. exports to China rose to $8.6 billion in April, up from a 10-year monthly trough of $6.8 billion in February, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Imports from China shot up to $31.1 billion from $19.8 billion in March, which marked the lowest monthly total in 11 years. 
U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed that soybean exports to China rose to 423,891 metric tons in April, more than doubling the 208,505 tonnes imported in March.
U.S. officials, including Lighthizer and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have recently affirmed China's commitment to meet the terms of the Phase 1 trade deal, which calls for China to boost purchases of U.S. farm and manufactured goods, energy and services by $200 billion over two years. 
Lighthizer said last week that about $10 billion in Chinese purchase commitments had been made under the deal, including $1 billion worth of cotton.
A person familiar with both U.S. and Chinese thinking on the trade deal said that Navarro's comments appeared to be a ""slip of the tongue,"" reflecting his personal hawkish views on China and not administration policy.
The person also said that Chinese officials have indicated that June imports from the United States were expected to show a dramatic increase after falls in recent months due to the outbreak.
STRONG INVESTMENT 
U.S. companies had announced $2.3 billion in new direct investment projects in the first quarter of 2020, only slightly down from last year's quarterly average despite the coronavirus, the Rhodium Group said in a recent study (https://arraysproduction-0dot22.s3.amazonaws.com/rhodiumgroup/assets/icon/TWS-2020_Report_8May2020_Final.pdf) - indicating that U.S. companies are not significantly reducing their China footprint. 
Bill Reinsch, a senior adviser and trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said it took over 20 years for the U.S. and Chinese economies to grow together, and decoupling cannot be accomplished easily.
Some companies are leaving, not because of Trump, but because of rising Chinese wage rates and Chinese policies that have disadvantaged foreign-owned businesses, he said. 

""If you're in China to serve the Chinese market, you're going to stay because you can't serve it as well from the outside,"" Reinsch said. ""The president can't simply order everybody to come home. Businesses will make rational, economic decisions.""

(Reuters) - Foreign investment in Latin America risks ""drying out"" due to economic turmoil and fiscal instability sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially if Chinese-led commodity demand remains weak, a former Colombian finance minister said on Tuesday. 
""There is a risk that markets for the region dry out somewhat, [due to] large recessions, high unemployment, deteriorated fiscal accounts and low terms of trade,"" Mauricio Cardenas told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. 
""My sense is China will not grow more than 5% in the next few years and the model will favor renewables,"" said Cardenas, adding that a stronger Chinese recovery could aid Latin America by buoying demand for commodity exports. 
Shutdowns to battle the coronavirus have hit global oil prices (LCOc1) this year, broadly knocking the shares of producers and compounding the economic fallout for Latin American countries, especially those heavily dependent on oil revenue. 
Cardenas expects Colombia's oil production to fall from around 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) to around 800,000 bpd this year, adding that majority state-owned oil firm Ecopetrol (CN:ECO) (N:ECO) is unlikely to receive much government support. 
""The government will try to take as much cash from Ecopetrol as possible in 2021,"" he said.
Colombia has projected oil production for this year between 820,000 and 850,000 bpd.

Cardenas said Brazil's Petrobras (SA:PETR4) (SA:PETR3) is unlikely to add more than 1 million bpd to its production between now and 2025, while Mexico's Pemex is unlikely to boost production or meet its stated oil production goals due to lower capital spending.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin raised income tax for wealthy Russians and offered new state handouts to families with children on Tuesday, days before the country votes on reforms that could keep him in power until 2036. 
In a televised speech to the nation, Putin, 67, said Russia's response to the coronavirus crisis had saved tens of thousands of lives and he ordered the extension of several support measures to cushion the economic fallout. 
Deviating from a flat 13% tax he himself introduced almost two decades ago, Putin said the wealthy would now pay 15% on annual income over 5 million roubles ($72,833) and that the additional cash would go towards helping sick children. 
The move, to be introduced from January, is likely to play well with voters frustrated by years of falling incomes. Many also dislike the class of wealthy businessmen which sprang up after the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
Putin's speech came ahead of a seven-day national vote starting on Thursday in which Russians will approve or reject an array of reforms, including one that could allow Putin to serve two more terms in the Kremlin instead of stepping down in 2024.
Putin promised to expand a programme to help families with mortgages and to offer a one-off payment next month of 10,000 roubles for each child they have aged up to 16, measures he said would help them weather the fallout from the coronavirus crisis. 
Russia, which has registered the world's third largest number of coronavirus cases, has largely ended its lockdown, but the crisis is expected to cause a 6% economic contraction this year.
Putin also proposed cutting tax on IT companies' profit to 3% from 20%. Though short on details, the proposal prompted Russian internet giant  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX)'s shares to rise more than 3%.

Speaking at the Bloomberg Invest Global virtual conference, Nouriel Roubini predicted the recovery from the pandemic crisis will soon fizzle out and be more anemic than the one that followed the global financial meltdown more than a decade ago. Joseph Stiglitz said politicians must fight that by assuring citizens that public support programs will continue as long as needed.
“The critical issue is what policy governments pursue,”said Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University and recipient of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics. “We need to be frank -- there’s a lot of uncertainty about that.”
Roubini -- known for for warning the International Monetary Fund in 2006 that the U.S. housing market would soon collapse -- painted a picture of a bleak future with so-called stagflation, in which growth stagnates but inflation picks up.
“We’re going to be faced now with a significant amount of negative supply shocks in the global economy,” he said, citing deglobalization and slower technological innovation, alongside enoormous money creation to help with debt loads. “Eventually the inflation genie will get out of the bottle.”
Both economists said globalization, already under pressure before the pandemic, has taken another hit. Roubini, chief executive of Roubini Macro Associates Inc., cited technology, where China has already strong presence in 5G and the internet of things, as a key battleground.
Americans could turn away from Chinese technology because of fears of surveillance, even though such technology will become embedded in everyday items such as toasters.
Policy makers internationally have rolled out massive monetary and fiscal stimulus to counter the deepest downturn since the Great Depression in the 1930s, challenging some of the fundamental underpinnings of faith in the free-market economy.
Both economists agreed that Europe has done a better job than the U.S. with furlough programs to keep people in their jobs, which may mean Europe has a stronger recovery. The U.S. paycheck protection program seems to have no effect on preserving hiring, Stiglitz said.
“We lost in the U.S. in the last few months many more jobs than we created in the last decade,” Roubini said. “The corporate sector first fires them, and then when they’re going to be rehiring them they’re going to do what they’ve done after the global financial crisis -- gig workers, contractors, part-time workers, hourly workers, freelancers.”
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“Our expectation now is a stepped recovery. Disease or not, relaxing lockdowns will mean a significant bounce in 3Q. After that, labor-market scars and post-pandemic caution will slow the progress back to potential.”
-Tom Orlik and Bjorn van Roye. Read their GLOBAL INSIGHT
The two men said even if production is brought back home, much of the work will be done by robots, meaning unemployment will remain high.
The pandemic has spurred fears globally that social inequalities will deepen, dampening overall consumption as people put more money aside as they face uncertain future. U.S. savings rates have already soared to an unprecedented one-third of disposable income.
It has also sparked renewed debate over whether this is a moment to fix some of the pre-existing weaknesses of the modern political economy.
Stiglitz said countries where there’s bigger trust in government have done better getting out of the pandemic. The U.S. should focus on a green transition, fix its infrastructure, health-care and school systems, and make sure and making sure everyone who “wants a job, has a job.”
Still, he said he’s “hopeful” that this crisis will provoke a changed attitude toward running the economy.
“American-style capitalism is going to take a beating if financial markets continue to behave in the way they’ve been behaving,” he said. “There is a responsible capitalism.”

""They've actually picked up their game,"" National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told Fox Business Network.
""It's not just commodity buying, although that is picking up too,"" but also extends to the issue of intellectual property theft, which has long been one of the sore spots for the relationship, he said.
Kudlow's comments marked the latest in a series of damage-control efforts by the Trump administration after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Monday night the pact was ""over."" 
Navarro, who made the comment in an interview with Fox News Channel, later walked it back, issuing a statement saying his remarks were taken ""wildly out of context.""

(Reuters) - San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly on Tuesday defended the U.S. central bank from criticism that its easy monetary policy and emergency lending programs are doing more to help the rich than the poor. 
""There really isn't this bright line that separates Main Street from Wall Street,"" Daly told CNN International. ""If we don't repair the financial markets and ensure they have liquidity, they can't pass along the interest rate changes to households and businesses that need them the most...our support for the economy supports everyone."" 
In the face of the coronavirus pandemic the Fed pushed interest rates down to near-zero, bought trillions of dollars of bonds, and rolled out nearly a dozen programs to backstop and extend corporate credit and promote bank lending. 
Critics say those moves benefit the rich by boosting the price of assets like stocks, even as millions of the working poor lose their jobs and income. Increased national attention to racism after the killing of George Floyd in police custody last month has sharpened the public focus on the Fed's role in exacerbating inequalities in the economic sphere. 
Daly said the Fed's policies are indeed saving jobs by repairing the ""plumbing"" of the financial system and helping companies maintain access to the financing that is critical to their operations.
Asked if the Fed's policies make inequality worse even inadvertently, Daly was unequivocal. 
""Not in my judgment,"" she said. 
But Daly said fighting racism, in addition to being a moral issue, also helps the economy by bringing more people into the labor market. 
""Ultimately our job is to ensure that every American that wants a job can get one...but right now of course we are fighting a global pandemic and so it's emergency support that we are offering.""

907,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 10:05AM ET</span>",Column: What would private equity funds in 401(k)s mean for retirement savers?,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Employer retirement plans are not known for their flashy investments - a majority of 401(k) investors these days use target date funds that invest in broad, diversified equity and fixed income mutual funds that automatically rebalance to minimize risk as retirement approaches.
That has been a healthy, if unexciting, trend. But in the years ahead, some plan sponsors may start spicing things up. Last week, the federal government opened the door for plan sponsors to add private equity funds to their 401(k) plans. Private equity funds invest in everything from buyouts of mature non-public companies to firms getting ready to go public - and even venture capital startups. Until now, these investments have been available only to wealthy and institutional investors. 
The private equity industry has been knocking on the 401(k) door for a number of years, and the attraction is not difficult to understand. Defined contribution plans represent a huge pool of investable funds, holding $8.9 trillion in assets at the end of 2019, according to the Investment Company Institute.
Private equity proponents scored a win last week when the U.S. Department of Labor (DoL) issued a guidance letter outlining how private equity could be added to defined contribution plans under existing rules (https://reut.rs/2BTOymi). The letter could mark a turning point in a broader move to open up private equity investing to less affluent, individual investors. 
In the retail investing world, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing its rules governing sales of private equity, including liberalization of the rules restricting these investments to ""accredited investors"" - those with net worth (excluding their primary residence) of $1 million or more, or annual income of at least $200,000 for single filers ($300,000 for joint filers) for the past two years.
Private equity advocates argue that these funds can produce higher returns over time than the stock of publicly held companies, even net of fees. 
""If you think of the stock market as a way for investors to harness the economic power of gross domestic product and capitalizing on that, a growing portion of that activity today is being held by private investors today as opposed to being in the public markets,” said David O’Meara, senior defined contribution strategist at consulting firm Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW).
A SLICE OF THE INVESTMENT PIE 
But the difference in returns among private equity funds can be huge. And unlike active mutual funds, where top performers do not outperform the market consistently over the long term, top private equity funds have greater “persistence,” because top managers get first look at the highest-quality investments, according to Fran Kinniry, global head of private investment at Vanguard. “You need to have confidence that you can pick managers who are in the top third of performance,” he said. 
If private equity does start popping up in workplace plans, it likely will have a slice of the investment pie in target date funds that will not exceed 15%, experts say.
Among the three largest providers of target date funds - Vanguard, Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price - none are jumping on the bandwagon yet, although none have ruled it out for the future. 
Vanguard, which has long advised foundations and endowments on private equity investments, is now expanding its offerings to high net-worth clients, and next year will begin offering it to clients in its fast-growing Personal Advisor Services who meet the current - or revised - accredited investor standards, Kinniry said.
One challenge for plan sponsors will be how to value private equity on a daily basis. In 401(k) plans, participants are able to check the value of their holdings at any time, but valuations of private equity investments are updated only periodically. 
Meanwhile, the DoL letter lays out some fiduciary hurdles that plan sponsors would have to leap, said Fred Reish, an attorney with Faegre Drinker who specializes in employee benefits. ""It says fiduciaries must have the expertise to be able to evaluate these products, or hire advisers or managers who do. And participants must be given information that they can understand and use to decide whether or not to be in that investment.""
Reish thinks those goals can be met by large, sophisticated 401(k) plans. But he does not expect to see private equity turning up in plans overnight, noting employers are a cautious bunch. “They read all the headlines about other plan sponsors being sued for violations of their fiduciary duties, and it scares them to death.”
In recent years, many of those headlines have been generated by attorney Jerome Schlichter, senior partner at Schlichter Bogard & Denton. He has won more than $350 million in 401(k) excessive-fee cases for employees and retirees, and won judgments that required defendants to improve their plans - relief he values at more than $1.5 billion.
""This is fraught with peril both for employees and companies that choose to do this,"" Schlichter said. ""There’s a reason private equity investments have been limited to wealthy, sophisticated investors. This is grafting a product that wasn’t designed to be in the retirement plan of an average investor into those retirement plans.""

908,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 09:40AM ET</span>",Explainer: Why COVID-19 can run rife in meatpacking plants,"(Reuters) - Meat-processing plants around the world are proving coronavirus infection hotspots, with an outbreak at a factory in Germany leading to Guetersloh becoming on Tuesday the first area in the country to be ordered back into lockdown. 
More than 1,500 workers at the Guetersloh plant tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, while outbreaks have also hit meat and poultry plants in Britain in recent days.
In many rural parts of the United States, meatpacking plants have been the main source of infection. On April 28, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to keep such factories open, warning of a potential threat to the U.S. food supply.
The meat industry is particularly susceptible to coronavirus infections because of the nature of the work: intense physical labour, conducted indoors at close proximity to other workers.
""Their work environments - processing lines and other areas in busy plants where they have close contact with coworkers and supervisors - may contribute substantially to their potential exposures,"" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says of meatpacking workers.
The CDC maintains a list of recommendations for factories, including steps to keep workers apart such as staggered arrival times and breaks, supplying workers with masks and hand sanitiser and making sure tools are disinfected. 
It says factories should take workers' temperatures on arrival and send those with fevers home.
Conditions on the factory floor itself are also not the only issue. Meatpacking workers often share transportation and housing once their shifts are over. 
In Germany, for example, many are migrants from poorer EU countries such as Bulgaria and Romania, often housed in large dormitories where the virus can spread.
""Some of these factories have on-site or nearby accommodation where there are several people in each dormitory, they may be transported on a bus to the site of work, and they will be indoors together all day,"" said Michael Head, an expert in global health at England's University of Southampton.

In the United States, by the end of May, the UFCW labour union estimated that at least 44 meatpacking workers had died of COVID-19, and that at least 30 meatpacking plants had to be temporarily shut down, impacting more than 45,000 workers and contributing to a 40% reduction in pork slaughtering capacity.

909,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>",Central banks hint at pandemic stimulus exit. Markets aren't buying it,"By Sujata Rao
(Reuters) - As strict coronavirus lockdowns end, some central bankers have started hinting at another kind of exit -- from emergency stimulus they launched just three months ago. Markets so far appear to be calling their bluff. 
The estimated $5 trillion in asset purchases unleashed by the five biggest central banks to cushion the impact of the pandemic has helped lift world stocks to within 10% of record highs, while the global economy seems set for recovery -- confirmed by advance readings of June business activity surveys.
Some central banks have signalled full-throttle stimulus won't last for ever, though, including the Bank of England which last week slowed its bond purchases, citing signs of economic improvement.
Yet in contrast to the decade after the 2008 financial crisis, when any hint that stimulus might be unwound provoked a ""taper tantrum"", markets have paid little heed. 
Responses to the BoE were confined to a brief spike in sterling and a dip in bond prices. Nor did markets react much to People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang urging stimulus restraint and ""timely withdrawal of policy tools in advance"".
There are many reasons why central banks may be wary of keeping asset purchases at their current pace, above all the potential for a debt ""hangover"" highlighted by Yi. But investors reckon policymakers are only preparing the ground for changes.
""My interpretation is that central banks are sending little messages saying 'don't take me for granted'. Now some people will be listening, others won't and others will say 'yeah I heard you, but I think you are bluffing',"" said Kim Catechis, head of investment strategy at  Legg Mason  (NYSE:LM) affiliate, Martin Currie, in Edinburgh.
He said investors likened central banks to firefighters: ""They are going to stay there, chucking more water ... until the embers are completely out, and they don't think that the job is done yet.""
Chinese 10-year bond yields rose 4 bps on Monday after the PBOC held off cutting its loan prime rate and are up 14 basis points in June. But Shanghai shares (SSEC) are at three-month highs. 
Norway's and Canada's currencies meanwhile firmed only modestly following relatively hawkish policy messages, with the Norges Bank even outlining a rate hike path from 2022.
The subdued reaction is partly because the big guns of central banking -- the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan -- show no signs of straying from the stimulus path. Fed chairman Jerome Powell vowed last week to keep his ""foot on the gas"".
And unlike in the previous crisis, governments are also stepping up with trillions of dollars in stimulus spending via income support and infrastructure schemes.
""When I think about the world's two major central banks - the Fed and the ECB, they don't seem to be in any hurry to raise rates,"" said Salman Baig, multi-asset investment manager at Unigestion. ""So I'm not too worried, at least not for now."" 
GRAPHIC: Fed's balance sheet shrinks - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakpeqdwmpr/Pasted%20image%201592513591207.png 
The Fed's $7 trillion balance sheet shrank last week for the first time since February and its repo balance -- short-term funding deals for commercial banks -- has plunged to nine-month lows. But that is because money market funding strains have abated and other central banks are tapping the Fed for fewer dollars.

NORMAL
Given the improving growth and markets picture, some tinkering with policy settings may be inevitable. 
""Policy is on an emergency dial at the moment and clearly emergency settings are not supposed to be indefinite,"" said Sarah Hewin, chief Europe economist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF).
""They are saying QE is in place and we don't think there is a need to be going full pelt.""
It also could be that policymakers are getting queasy about debt levels: Britain's public debt ratio recently surpassed 100%. This is why the Bank for International Settlements, the umbrella group for central banks, is urging efforts to return policy to ""a new normal"".
But few expect a serious rowback soon. The global economy is expected to contract 6% this year, with further lockdowns still a risk.
There are also lessons from the past. The ECB's 2011 interest rate rise and the Fed's move that year to start shrinking its balance sheet are often blamed for strangling the recovery after 2008.
""Willingness to keep the taps open and not retrace course too early -- that's one of the big lessons from the financial crisis,"" said Jeroen Blokland, portfolio manager at Robeco.

""Central banks will try to remove some stimulus only if the recovery is structural.""

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's banking regulator kept the amount of capital the country's six biggest lenders must hold at a record-low 1% of risk-weighted assets on Tuesday, and said it was prepared to lower it further if needed.
The Office of the Superintendent of  Financial Institutions  (NASDAQ:FISI) (OSFI) noted elevated financial system vulnerabilities and pressure on highly indebted households and businesses due to the coronavirus outbreak, but said the current Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) level remains effective in supporting the banking system and overall economy.
OSFI made an out-of-schedule 1.25-percentage-point reduction to the buffer in March, freeing up more than C$300 billion ($222.24 billion) of additional lending capacity as part of a broader push by authorities to maintain liquidity and limit the pandemic's economic hit.
""This action was taken to support banks' ability to continue to provide loans and services to Canadians,"" OSFI said in Tuesday's statement. ""OSFI expects banks to continue to draw on this capacity to support Canadian businesses and households.""
Canada's six biggest banks increased lending to households and businesses by 10.8% in the three months ended April 30, and put aside nearly C$11 billion to cover potential losses.
OSFI, which reviews and sets the DSB level every June and December, had raised it by 25 basis points every time since it was introduced at 1.5% in June 2018 until December.
When it made the reduction in March, it said any increases following that would not take effect for at least 18 months.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will ""tailor"" capital rules for insurers inherited from the European Union as it takes back control of its crucial financial services sector, finance minister Rishi Sunak said on Tuesday.
Britain left the EU in January and will no longer be required to follow the bloc's financial rules after December, when a transition period ends.
Sunak set out on Tuesday how the government intends to regulate Europe's biggest financial sector, saying that it would make reforms to maintain the soundness of capital markets and manage future risks.
EU capital rules for insurers, known as Solvency II, have long been criticised by UK lawmakers as too inflexible, and the government start reviewing them in the autumn.
""The government ... plans to bring forward a review of certain features of Solvency II to ensure that it is properly tailored to take account of the structural features of the UK insurance sector,"" Sunak said.
Britain will also make existing retail customer disclosure rules known as PRIIPs function better, he said.
Outside the EU, Britain will come under more pressure to keep its financial services sector globally competitive.
The EU is the biggest export customer for Britain's financial services and Sunak said an ""enduring future relationship"" with the bloc would help to complement the UK’s leading global role in financial services:
""The government continues to believe that comprehensive mutual findings of equivalence between the UK and the EU are in the best interests of both parties, and we remain open and committed to continuing dialogue with the EU about their intentions in this respect.""

Direct access to EU markets for financial firms from Britain will depend on whether Brussels deems UK rules to be ""equivalent"" - or as robust as those in the bloc. Both sides have agreed that such an assessment should be completed by the end of this month.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amid calls for a boycott of Chinese goods after a border clash in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed, India's government instructed sellers to declare the country of origin for goods and services purchased via a state-run online portal. 
The government announced the change in requirements for users of its Government e-Marketplace (GeM) portal in a statement on Tuesday. It did not single out China but an official source told Reuters the main objective was to identify items coming from China.
Separately, the portal will provide a ""Make in India"" filter so that the government or its agencies could choose to buy only those products that meet the minimum 50% local content criteria, the statement said. 
Welcoming the decision, the industry chambers, pressure groups close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party asked the government to extend new rules to private online platforms.
The economic wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the guiding body of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said Tuesday's move would help curb Chinese imports and should be extended to other platforms like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
""The government should extend the rules to all platforms so that consumers get a choice not to buy Chinese products,"" Ashwani Mahajan, co-convenor of Swadeshi Jagran Manch, told Reuters.
According to officials the portal, which was set up in 2016 to promote small businesses, has been misused by many companies to sell imported Chinese products like office furniture, computers, air conditioners, auto parts, machinery and other products.
""The decision will encourage domestic producers, as many domestic sellers were so far importing goods from China and selling through this portal,"" a government source, with the direct knowledge of the matter, said.
India is also planning to impose higher trade barriers and raise import duties on around 300 products from China and elsewhere, two government officials said, as part of an effort to protect domestic businesses.
The government has instructed all its ministries and agencies to maximise procurement through the portal, run by the commerce ministry, and total purchases are expected to increase to 3 trillion rupees (nearly $40 billion) this fiscal year from 500 billion rupees (nearly $7 billion) from the year just ended in March.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said lawmakers need to quickly determine how to tighten regulation in the wake of an accounting scandal at payments company Wirecard that has tarnished the reputation of Germany's financial watchdog.
The Wirecard case ""raises critical questions about supervision of the company, in particular with regards to accounting and balance sheet control,"" Scholz told Reuters on Tuesday.
""It appears that neither auditors nor regulators were effective here,"" he added. 
The comments were an about-face from a brief statement he made on Monday, in which he said regulators had worked hard and done their job.
Wirecard had said on Monday that 1.9 billion euros ($2.15 billion) it had booked in its accounts likely never existed, a black hole that has led to the arrest of its chief executive and that threatens to engulf the company.
Scholz said that any mistakes made by financial watchdog Bafin in the supervision of Wirecard ""now need to be identified and eliminated quickly"".

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Opposition parties in Denmark are pushing for temporary cuts to one of the world's highest tax regimes to ensure pandemic cash handouts boost consumption instead of ending up in state coffers.
Denmark rivals France among advanced economies for the heaviest tax burden on its citizens - who by and large accept it as the price to be paid for their cradle-to-grave welfare state.
But the downside of a system that taxes nearly 45% of gross domestic output is that much of the 60 billion Danish crowns ($9.1 billion) in cash handouts agreed as stimulus will go back to the state rather than being spent on goods and services to revive the economy.
""We need to get the wheels rolling,"" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told parliament on Monday.
""We rarely ask Danes directly to spend money. I would like to do that today. If you can afford an extra night at a restaurant or a summer trip around the country - do it,"" Frederiksen said.
But opposition parties and economists say Denmark's top tax rate of 56% will encourage many in the top tax bracket to redirect money to pension schemes rather than spend it.
The cash payout would be financed by Danes' own holiday allowance, which has been frozen as part of a revamp last year of the holiday pay system and was meant to be paid out as an additional pension when people retire.
A third of the 60 billion crowns would go to around 400,000 Danes in the top tax bracket.
""The behaviour of taxpayers, who pay the top tax rate, is paramount when it comes to how much stimulus the 60 billion will give,"" said Mads Lundby Hansen, chief economist at liberal think tank CEPOS.
Denmark and France's tax to GDP ratios of 44.86% and 46.09% respectively are far above the average among developed countries of 34.26%, according to the latest OECD data. Denmark also charges a 25% value-added tax on most goods and services.
Frederiksen's Social Democrats won last year's election by pledging to increase public spending and make businesses and the wealthy pay more towards welfare services through higher taxes.
But the cash handout, due to reach citizens later this year, has become a thorny issue for the Social Democrats as it would also push another 100,000 tax payers into the top tax bracket, including senior nurses and teachers - just as the economy is set to tip into recession due to the pandemic.
Opposition parties have instead suggested temporarily raising the top tax rate bar or applying a uniform tax on the one-off cash handout. The issue is currently being negotiated in parliament.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union countries and lawmakers struck a deal late on Monday to pave the way for Europeans to team up and sue companies for defective products but with built-in safeguards to guard against the excesses of U.S. class action lawsuits.
The move to boost consumers' rights gained pace following Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) diesel cheating scandal which has led to thousands of regulatory investigations and lawsuits.
The European Parliament said such lawsuits could cover data protection, financial services, travel and tourism, energy, telecommunications, environment and health, and air and train passenger rights.
The agreement between representatives of EU governments and the European Parliament will need to be rubber stamped by the 27 EU countries and the legislative body in the coming weeks. The bloc will have two years to convert the EU legislation into national laws.
The European Commission announced the proposal in 2018, but it was delayed by disagreements among EU countries and EU lawmakers.
""We have sought to strike a balance between the legitimate protection of consumer interests and the need for legal certainty for businesses,"" lawmaker Geoffroy Didier said in a statement.
European consumer lobbying group BEUC welcomed the agreement.
""This deal is a huge landmark to make justice available to all EU consumers. Consumers can finally go to court as a group when their rights have been harmed by the same trader,"" BEUC director general Monique Goyens said. 
Under the agreement, each EU country will have to name at least one consumer organisation or public body to launch class actions on behalf of consumers.

Safeguards to prevent frivolous or abusive litigation include the ""loser pays"" principle which ensures that the defeated party in a lawsuit pays the costs of the proceedings for the successful party.

Europe’s largest economy will contract 6.5% this year and grow 4.9% in 2021, according to the latest forecast by the Council of Economic Experts, an advisory group to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government also known as the Five Sages.
The projection for this year compares with the Bundesbank’s -7.1% and the government’s forecast of -6.3%.
”The coronavirus pandemic is forecast to cause the worst economic downturn since the Federal Republic of Germany was founded,” Lars P. Feld, head of the Council, said in a statement released on Tuesday. “However, we expect a recovery to set in from summer onwards.”
To help accelerate the emergence from Germany’s worst recession since the end of World War II, the government this month launched a $145 billion stimulus plan.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Monday that he expected Germany’s economic output to return to pre-crisis levels by the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022.

Investing.com -- President Trump contradicts his most hawkish trade advisor, saying the U.S.-China trade deal is still ""fully intact"". Peter Navarro meanwhile walked back his comments to Fox that it's ""over"". Purchasing manager indexes in Europe point to a better-than-expected stabilization after the pandemic and the same firm puts out a survey for the U.S. later. There's also data on new home sales and surveys from Redbook Research and the Richmond Fed. Stocks are set to open higher, but there could be a question mark over Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) after a fatal accident in Germany that may have involved its Autopilot future, while oil prices hit their highest since March 3 on growing confidence in the demand outlook. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, June 23rd.
1. This Chinese trade deal is not dead, it's resting          
The U.S.’s trade deal with China is fraying. Trade advisor Peter Navarro told Fox News late on Monday that the deal was “over”, in a conversation that had previously mentioned Chinese backsliding on pledges to buy U.S. farm products and the general deterioration in Chinese-U.S. relations over recent months due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the situation in Hong Kong.
President Donald Trump had responded via Twitter that ““The China Trade Deal is fully intact. Hopefully they will continue to live up to the terms of the Agreement!”
The deal, signed in January, was the pretext for suspending tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese imports in a move that appeared aimed at sparing U.S. consumers further pain in an election year.
2. Europe PMIs point to stronger than expected rebound
There was fresh evidence that Europe’s economy is stabilizing after the sharp drop in output due to lockdown measures in March and April.
HIS Markit’s composite purchasing managers’ index for the euro zone recovered to 47.5 in June from 31.9 in May, reflecting a big upward swing in output expectations and in business confidence. Indexes for France and the U.K. even made it above the 50 line that typically denotes growth.
However, the overall eurozone number indicates that the economy is still contracting, if at a slower pace. As such, it’s more reflective of a tick- or swoosh-shaped recovery than a V-shaped one.
That didn’t stop European stock markets from rallying to their highest in two weeks, Germany’s DAX rising 2.5% and the Stoxx 600 rising 1.5%.
3. Stocks set to open higher
U.S. stocks are set to open higher in the wake of President Trump’s intervention on the issue of the China trade deal. Whether or not the administration feels China is living up to its commitments, the positive reaction to Trump’s tweet suggests that the market is just content that it’s not calling Beijing out on the apparent backsliding yet.
 By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 Futures was up 226 points or 0.9%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 0.8% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.6%.
In focus later will be T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS), against the backdrop of Softbank’s decision to sell down its stake in the company following the merger with Sprint, a Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) portfolio company. Tesla stock may also attract scrutiny after another fatal crash in Germany that raised suspicions that its Autopilot software may have malfunctioned.
4. U.S. PMI, new home sales, Richmond Fed survey due
After the strong European numbers, IHS Markit will also publish a PMI for the U.S. at 9:45 AM ET (1345).  While the survey isn’t as closely followed as the Institute of Supply Management’s, the two are rarely far apart in their findings.
In addition, there will be an update on the retail sector from Redbook Research at 8:55 AM, and May’s numbers for new home sales at 10 AM. The latter will be released at the same time as the Richmond Fed’s regional business survey.
5. Oil hits highest since March 3 on PMIs; API eyed
Crude oil prices hit their highest level in over three and a half months, after the China news and the European PMIs reassured traders about the future trajectory of global demand.
By 6:30, U.S. crude futures were up 1.7% at $41.44 a barrel, only marginally below the intraday high of $41.56 that was the highest mark since March 3. The global benchmark Brent was up 1.6% at $43.76 a barrel.
The American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly estimate of U.S. crude oil stocks at 4:30 PM ET."

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's damaged economy needs urgent structural reforms to cope with the coronavirus impact, including letting smaller companies grow to compete better in Europe, the central bank head said on Tuesday.
""The design and implementation of reforms should be accelerated, as their credible implementation can generate positive effects on spending and investment,"" Bank of Spain Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos said. 
Speaking to a Spanish parliamentary committee, he also noted the need for pension, labour and housing access reforms, and added that the strategy should be deployed on a long-term basis with consensus among political parties.
""Fiscal consolidation, for its part, should be implemented once the economy returns to a solid growth path, but its early definition and communication would have important benefits for the credibility of our economic policy,"" he said.
Spain, one of the nations worst-affected by the COVID-19 with 28,324 deaths, is heading for its worst economic performance on record in 2020, with a contraction of between 9% to 11.6%, according to the Bank of Spain.
On Tuesday, De Cos said activity had already started to recover during the lifting of a three-month lockdown.
""If this continues, it will give way to a more favourable performance in the second half of the year,"" he said, noting, however, that there was still ""considerable uncertainty"" and the contraction could be as bad as 15% this year.
De Cos said that in the best-case scenario, Spain could grow 16% in the third quarter versus the previous three months, which would be its biggest quarterly increase on record.
The governor also said mechanisms were needed to encourage the growth of small- and mid-sized companies to reduce higher borrowing costs compared to European peers.
To continue supporting businesses, De Cos said an extension of the amount of the 100 billion euros ($112.88 billion) state-backed credit lines may be needed.
He also said an extension of furlough schemes in some sectors, such as tourism and hospitality, should be considered in coming months.

Japan has sought for years to attract foreign professionals in the sector to improve Tokyo's standing as a global financial centre, and the proposal aims to push the government to accelerate such moves, with Hong Kong residents in mind.
China on Saturday unveiled details of a new national security law for Hong Kong, which has raised fears among democracy activists and some foreign governments that Beijing is further eroding autonomy there.
""Given the current geopolitical situation in Asia, Japan should take advantage of being a safe business location, which is supported by solid democracy and the rule of law,"" said the proposal by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, while not mentioning specific countries.
Japan will improve the educational environment for families of highly skilled foreign workers by enticing more international schools as well as boosting visa support for assistant staff, the proposal said.
The 20-page document is set to be submitted to the government later this week with the aim of being reflected in the annual economic policy guidelines, which will be finalised in mid-July, according to two government sources who declined to be identified.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe suggested in parliament earlier this month that Japan could take in Hong Kong residents employed in the financial sector or other specialised areas as China moves to impose new security legislation.

Tokyo ranked third in Z/Yen Group's rankings of global financial centres published in March, up from sixth place in September, while Hong Kong, which had faced domestic political turbulence, fell from third to sixth place.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Global merchandise trade fell by a record amount in the first months of the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but stopped short of a worst-case scenario, the World Trade Organization (WTO) said on Tuesday.
The Geneva-based body forecast in April that global trade in goods would fall by between 13% and 32% in 2020, numbers that the WTO chief described as ""ugly"", before rebounding by 21-24% in 2021.
The WTO did not set new figures on Tuesday, but said rapid responses by governments meant its pessimistic scenario for this year was unlikely.
The volume of merchandise trade in fact shrank by 3% in the first quarter, the WTO said, and initial estimates pointed to a year-on-year decline of 18.5% for the second quarter.
""The fall in trade we are now seeing is historically large – in fact, it would be the steepest on record. But there is an important silver lining here: it could have been much worse,"" said WTO director‑general Roberto Azevedo.
The WTO said governments had reacted quicker than in the 2008-2009 crisis and income support had encouraged consumers to keep spending. Some sectors such as automobiles had fallen sharply, but others such as electronics had held up well.
If trade were to grow by 2.5% per quarter for the rest of the year, the more optimistic projection of minus 13% could be met, though that would still be worse than at the height of the financial crisis in 2009, when trade dropped by 12.5%.
However, the WTO said weaker-than-expected growth, wider trade restrictions and a possible second wave of infections could see a 2021 rebound falling short.

Trade could then recover only by about 5%, leaving it well short of the pre-pandemic trend. Monetary, fiscal and trade choices will play a significant role, the WTO said.

Navarro said his comments were taken ""wildly out of context"", while U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed in a tweet the deal with China was ""fully intact"".
""Hopefully they will continue to live up to the terms of the agreement,"" Trump said on Twitter.
Earlier, Navarro told Fox News ""it's over"" in an interview when asked about the trade agreement. 
He said the ""turning point"" came when the United States learned about the spreading coronavirus only after a Chinese delegation had left Washington following the signing of the Phase 1 deal on Jan. 15.
""It was at a time when they had already sent hundreds of thousands of people to this country to spread that virus, and it was just minutes after wheels up when that plane took off that we began to hear about this pandemic,"" Navarro said.
China on Tuesday responded to Navarro's claims about the trade deal with disdain.
""He consistently lies and has no honesty and trustworthiness,"" foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters at a regular press briefing.
As for the trade deal, Zhao said: ""China's stance on the issue has been consistent and clear."" He directed specific questions to relevant departments. 
Financial markets were choppy, with U.S. stock futures initially turning negative and risk-sensitive currencies including the Australian dollar falling. 
They have since recovered much of the lost ground after Navarro, one of the most outspoken critics of China among Trump's senior advisers, issued a statement saying his comments ""have been taken wildly out of context"". 
""They had nothing at all to do with the Phase I trade deal, which continues in place. I was simply speaking to the lack of trust we now have of the Chinese Communist Party after they lied about the origins of the China virus and foisted a pandemic upon the world,"" he said.
The U.S.-China trade negotiations lasted more than two years, heaped tariffs on $370 billion of Chinese products, whipsawed financial markets and dented global growth well before the coronavirus outbreak triggered a worldwide recession. 
U.S.-China relations have reached their lowest point in years since the coronavirus pandemic that began in China hit the United States hard. Trump and his administration have repeatedly accused Beijing of not being transparent about the outbreak.
Trump on Thursday renewed his threat to cut ties with China, a day after his top diplomats held talks with Beijing and his trade representative said he did not consider decoupling the U.S. and Chinese economies a viable option.
Under the Phase 1 trade deal, China had pledged to boost purchases of U.S. goods by $200 billion over two years. 
But disruptions wrought by the pandemic saw U.S. goods exports to China fall in the first quarter, providing a further challenge to the Trump administration less than five months out from the presidential election.
""We had expected U.S.-China tensions to escalate in the second half of this year in the run-up to the U.S. elections,"" said Vasu Menon, senior investment strategist, at OCBC Bank Wealth Management in Singapore.

""China hawks...like Navarro could gain the upper hand and egg (Trump) on to take action against China. So expect markets to be very bumpy in the second half of this year because of the double whammy from COVID-19 and U.S.-China tensions.""

""I don't see any conclusion this year.""
The 27-nation EU and China have both said they hope to conclude negotiations on the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment in 2020, after six years of talks. 
EU officials say they want to see movement in areas such as autos, biotech and micro-electronics and see Beijing limit subsidies for state-run companies.
Meeting halfway with Chinese negotiators is impossible as Europe is already far more open than China, said Wuttke. 
Speaking after video calls with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and President Xi Jinping, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the Chinese needed to be more ambitious. 
She also warned of ""very negative consequences"" if Beijing goes ahead with a new security law on Hong Kong that the West says will curtail basic rights.

Premier Li said on Monday that cooperation with the European Union outweighs competition, and China hopes the EU could relax export control measures against China.

929,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 03:01AM ET</span>","UK house prices to fall 5% this year, recover gradually: Reuters poll","By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - British home prices will fall this year and won't recover those losses until the end of 2022, a Reuters poll of property market analysts found, as high unemployment following the coronavirus pandemic saps demand.
Britain's economy shrank by a quarter over March and April as entire sectors were shuttered by a government-imposed lockdown, leading firms to shed jobs and vacancies to plunge by a record amount.
Concerned about their personal financial health, buyers are likely to be nervous about big purchases and house prices, the bedrock of consumer wealth in Britain, will drop 5.0% this year, the June 9-22 poll of 21 strategists found. Prices are forecast to rise 1.5% next year and 3.5% in 2022.
But in a worst-case scenario values will fall 11.0% this year, the poll found.
In a February poll, taken before Britain faced the full brunt of the pandemic's effect, prices were expected to rise 2.0% this year and 2.8% in 2021. 
""I would expect the housing market to be a casualty of the economic scarring that will result from this recession,"" said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
""With prices already looking elevated and incomes set to be squeezed, market clearing prices can be expected to fall significantly.""
Reuters Poll: United Kingdom housing market outlook, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/xklvyzkzkpg/UK%20housing%20outlook.PNG
The predicted fall in prices comes despite borrowing costs at a record low. To offer support to a floundering economy the Bank of England has chopped its key interest rate to just 0.10% and is not expected to change that until 2022 at least. 
In London, long the hotbed for foreign investors, prices will also fall 5.0% this year but the recovery in the capital is expected to be stronger. Prices there will rise 2.0% next year and 4.3% in 2022.
Eleven of 19 respondents to an additional question said the recovery in activity would be gradual. Four said it would be slow and long, while two said it would be quick and another two that buying and selling had already recovered.
""Housing market activity is unlikely to return to normal levels until it is clear that the worst of the COVID-19 crisis is behind us,"" said Andrew Brigden at Fathom Consulting.
High unemployment will be the biggest hurdle faced by the UK housing market over the coming year, all but one of 18 respondents to a separate question said.
""Rising unemployment and the risk of redundancies is likely to have a negative impact on the housing market over the coming months. Many people will choose to put off any major financial decisions, including buying or selling a house,"" said Jamie Durham at PwC.
Reuters Poll: UK housing market recovery, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/qmyvmgngavr/UK%20housing%20Tableau%20(2).png
Further clouding the near-term outlook, Britain's transition period after leaving the European Union is due to expire at the end of December and so far there has been scant sign of agreement as to the future relationship the two sides will have.
""While COVID-19 has caused a wave of uncertainty, Brexit is still on the horizon and a 'no deal' may put further downward pressure on house prices, both before and after the transition period ends,"" PwC's Durham said. 
Despite the expected fall in prices home values were still seen as expensive, especially in London.
When asked to describe the level of national house prices on a scale of 1 to 10 from extremely cheap to extremely expensive, the median response was 6. But in the capital it was 8.
""If you are in work UK prices are relatively affordable with current interest rates. London is still a stretch but they have fallen since the peak,"" said Miles Shipside at Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY).

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve struck the right tone in its first pandemic-era economic outlook, suggesting years of extraordinary policy support for an economy facing a slow and long slog back, according to a majority of economists in a Reuters poll.
While the June 15-22 poll of over 100 economists showed a recovery from the steepest economic downturn was underway as commerce reopens, the loss of output in the first half of this year was not expected to be recouped by the end of next year.
The central bank at its policy meeting on June 10 pledged to keep monetary policy loose for years to help an economy that has buckled under the shutdowns, restrictions and other measures to battle the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected around 9 million people worldwide and killed nearly 120,000 in the United States. 
While unprecedented fiscal and economic stimulus sparked a rally in stock markets after a trough in late-March, three-quarters of economists polled, or 45 of 60, said the Fed's somber economic projections and its ultra-easy policy stance was ""about right.""
Ten respondents said the Fed's projections were ""too pessimistic"" and only five said ""too optimistic.""
Economic data appear to back up the Fed's economic projections, with jobless claims still more than double their peak during the Great Recession. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has acknowledged it could take years for all the people left unemployed during the pandemic to reacquire jobs.
""I think the Fed is trying to convey a realistic assessment,"" said Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX Research and North America macro strategy at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF).
""We have 20.1 million more unemployed people and in the next couple of months a lot of those people are likely to come back to work. So, if that doesn't happen, it's a disaster. Because, it means that even with all the stimulus, nothing's working.""
(Graphic: Reuters Poll - Views on Fed's economic outlook - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/jznpnzeeqpl/Views%20on%20Fed.PNG)
The May employment report showing a gain of 2.5 million jobs was unexpectedly strong, wrongfooting every forecaster who expected many millions more people out of work.
Asked what best describes that report, over 60% of 58 economists who responded said it ""overstates the strength of the job market recovery,"" while the other 40% said it was ""about right."" None said it understated job market strength.
""The May numbers are a reopening bounce with an unemployment rate that understates the true level of labor market dislocation due to misclassification errors,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
The unemployment rate was forecast to fall gradually over the next two years, but still remain well above pre-COVID levels, averaging 9.8% this year and 8.0% next year, meaning the Fed would not meet its dual mandate - 2% inflation and full employment - until at least 2022.
The central bank was expected to keep rates near zero over the forecast horizon and expand its balance sheet, at a little over $7 trillion currently, to $9 trillion by end-2020 and to $10 trillion by end-2021.
(Graphic: Reuters Poll - U.S. economy, jobless rate, Fed balance sheet - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/xegpbmkynvq/U.S.%20economy%20and%20balance%20sheet.PNG)
U.S. gross domestic product will shrink an unprecedented 34.8% this quarter after contracting 5.0% last quarter, on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, according to the poll, and broadly unchanged from the last survey.
The economy was forecast to grow 18.5% in the third quarter and 8.0% in the fourth quarter, compared to 16.0% and 9.0% forecast in the last poll.
In a worst-case scenario, the economy was forecast to grow 3.8% in Q3, but shrink 0.9% in Q4, compared to a contraction of 2.5% and 1.0%, respectively, in the May poll.
The median forecast saw the economy on course to contract 5.8% this year, but grow 4.1% in 2021. In a worst-case scenario, it was expected to shrink 9.3% this year and grow just 0.4% next year.
""All else equal, an earlier COVID vaccine would likely have a larger economic impact, as prolonged weakness in the absence of a vaccine increases the likelihood of severe scarring effects such as permanent layoffs and business closures that are not reversed even after the arrival of a vaccine,"" noted Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

932,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 02:15AM ET</span>",Japan sticks to budget surplus goal despite massive virus spending,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will stick to its target of getting its budget back to surplus by 2025, its finance minister said on Tuesday, even as the heavily indebted government ramps up spending to offset the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
When asked about S&P Global Ratings' recent cut to the outlook on Japan's sovereign credit rating, Finance Minister Taro Aso said the country could avert a ratings downgrade if pledged stimulus revived the economy and restored revenue.
""We have no immediate plan to review the primary budget goal,"" Aso told reporters after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.
The fiscal goal will be included in the government's key mid-year policy platform, to be issued by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's top economic advisory council next month.
Having rolled out a combined $2.2 trillion in two stimulus packages to avert a deeper recession, Abe's government remains under pressure to prioritise growth over fiscal reform in the short term.
""We are not in a position to prioritise fiscal reform now, so we will give it just a modest mention,"" said a government source, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to media publicly.
The prospects of falling tax revenue and snowballing social security spending to support the fast-ageing population have already made it difficult to reach a primary budget surplus by the end of the March 2026 fiscal year.
Still, the budget target, which excludes new bond sales and debt-servicing costs, is seen as the government's commitment to fix the industrial world's heaviest public debt, which is more than twice the size of its $5 trillion economy.
""If we give up on the target, fiscal discipline would be thrown out of the window, leading to Japan selling among investors in the future,"" another government source told Reuters.
S&P Global Ratings this month cut its outlook on Japan's sovereign debt rating to stable from positive, citing uncertainty over the country's fiscal health.
In 2017, Abe postponed a commitment to balance the budget by five years to 2025, due to increased spending needs to meet promised social security commitments.
The heavy stimulus has boosted Japan's primary budget deficit sevenfold to 66 trillion yen ($616.25 billion) this fiscal year, raising the reliance on debt as tax and other income failed to finance policy spending like defence and education by as much.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's car industry called on the government to introduce additional measures such as a sales tax cut to boost the sector as a third of automotive workers remain furloughed due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
Factories closed in March as a lockdown was enforced to contain the spread of the pandemic with some still shut and many operating at a much reduced output, setting the industry up for the lowest level of production in decades. 
Car and van volumes are expected to fall by a third to 920,000 units this year and up to one in six jobs are at risk, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) industry body said. 
The government has introduced a series of policies to support the economy including a furlough scheme which sees it pay 80% of salaries, up to 2,500 pounds ($3,120) per month, for staff who are placed on temporary leave. 
""Government’s intervention has been unprecedented,"" said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes. 
""But the job isn’t done yet. Just as we have seen in other countries, we need a package of support to restart, to build demand, volumes and growth,"" he said, calling for measures to boost consumer confidence and unfettered access to emergency funding. 
The sector, Britain's biggest exporter of goods, is also worried that trading terms with the European Union could worsen after a Brexit transition period finishes at the end of 2020.
""A ‘no deal’ scenario would severely damage these prospects and could see volumes falling below 850,000 by 2025 – the lowest level since 1953,"" the SMMT said.

The government has promised to support business throughout the coronavirus crisis and talks are ongoing between London and Brussels to secure a trade agreement with the EU to come into force from Jan 1.

934,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 11:25PM ET</span>",Trump suspends entry of certain foreign workers despite business opposition,"By Ted Hesson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump suspended the entry into the United States of certain foreign workers on Monday, a move the White House said would help the coronavirus-battered economy, but which business groups strongly oppose.
Trump issued a presidential proclamation that temporarily blocks foreign workers entering on H-1B https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-IMMIGRATION/WORKERS/xklvyzkdxpg/h1b.jpg visas for skilled employees, and L visas, for managers and specialized workers being transferred within a company.
He also blocked those entering on H-2B seasonal worker visas, used by landscapers and other industries.
The visa suspension, which takes effect on Wednesday until the end of the year, will open up 525,000 jobs for U.S. workers, a senior administration official said on a call with reporters.
The official, who did not explain how the administration arrived at that figure, said the move was geared at ""getting Americans back to work as quickly as possible."" 
But businesses including major tech companies and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the visa suspension would stifle the economic recovery after the damage done by the pandemic. 
Critics of the measure say Trump is using the pandemic to achieve his longstanding goal to limit immigration. The proclamation's immediate effects are likely to be limited, as U.S. consulates around the world remain closed for most routine visa processing. 
The proclamation exempts those already in the United States, as well as valid visa holders abroad, but they must have an official travel document that permits entry into the United States.
Immigration attorneys were working on Monday to determine what the order might mean for clients now out of the country.
The measure also exempts food supply chain workers and people whose entry is deemed in the national interest. The suspension will include work-authorized J visas for cultural exchange opportunities, including camp counselors and au pairs, as well as visas for the spouses of H-1B workers.
Republican Trump is running for re-election on Nov. 3 and has made his tough immigration stance a central pitch to voters, although the coronavirus, faltering economy and nationwide protests over police brutality have overshadowed that issue.
The president has faced pressure to restrict work visas from groups that seek lower levels of immigration, as well as some Republican lawmakers.
In a statement, BSA, the Software Alliance, whose members include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Slack, urged the administration to ""refrain from restricting employment of highly-skilled foreign professionals,"" adding, ""These restrictions will negatively impact the U.S. economy,"" and decrease job opportunities for Americans.
Doug Rand, co-founder of Boundless, a pro-migrant group that helps families navigate the U.S. immigration system, said the fact that H-2A visas used to bring in foreign farmworkers were exempt signals that ""big agriculture interests are the only stakeholder with any sway over immigration policy in this administration.""
H-2B visas, which were included in the suspension, have been used by Trump owned- or Trump-branded businesses, including his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.
Many business groups were lobbying against a temporary visa ban before it was announced.
Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst with the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, estimated that the new ruling would block 219,000 foreign workers through the rest of the year. 
""This is introducing more chaos into an already chaotic situation for a lot of U.S. companies,"" she said.
""The administration is making the assumption that these companies did not already look at the U.S. labor market, which most of them do before they get involved in a complicated process of trying to bring in foreign workers.""
Mitch Wexler, a managing partner at law firm Fragomen, said the order would hurt his social media and wireless communications clients and other tech companies.
Employers ""wouldn't pay a lot of money to file these applications and hire lawyers like me if they could hire an American for these positions,"" he said.
Trump also renewed an April proclamation that blocks some foreigners from permanent residence in the United States, extending that measure until the end of the year.
The senior administration official said that proclamation freed up roughly 50,000 jobs for Americans, but did not provide details.
The visa suspension issued on Monday narrows an exemption for medical workers in Trump's April ruling to include only people working on coronavirus research and care.
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said there were 15,269 petitions for H-1B visas in healthcare-related jobs across the United States in fiscal year 2019.
The Trump administration will make several other moves to tighten rules around temporary work visas.
The administration plans to rework the H-1B visa program so that the 85,000 visas available each year go to the highest-paid applicants, instead of the current lottery system, the senior administration official said.
It also plans to issue rules making it harder for companies to use the H-1B visa program to train foreign workers to perform the same job in another country, the official said.
Both moves would likely require regulatory changes.
The Trump administration is also taking steps to limit work permits for asylum-seekers, finalizing a regulation on Monday to remove a requirement to process such permits within 30 days.

A separate asylum measure set to be finalized on Friday would greatly limit asylum seekers' access to work permits.

935,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 11:09PM ET</span>",U.S. Set to Announce Aluminum Tariffs on Canada by End of Week,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is considering re-imposing tariffs on aluminum imports from Canada and an announcement could come by the end of the week, according to people familiar with the matter.
If Canada refuses to impose export restrictions on aluminum, the U.S. will announce Friday the re-imposition of 10% tariffs on aluminum from the country and implement the tariffs by July 1, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.
That would be just days before the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal enters into force on July 1. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has expressed concern about recent struggles by American aluminum producers, which have seen sales drop and all-in prices sink as demand evaporated amid the global pandemic.
Lighthizer told the Senate Finance Committee in a hearing last week that recent surges in metal imports from North American neighbors are “of genuine concern to us now,” and that his office was looking at the issue.
“I would say there have been surges on steel and aluminum, substantially from Canada, some from Mexico, and it is something that we’re looking at and talking to both Mexico and Canada about,” he told the panel’s top Republican, Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa.
A spokesman for the USTR didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment outside office hours.
Under the May 2019 agreement, which resulted in initial tariffs being lifted, Canada has to limit its retaliation to the U.S. metals sector and cannot hit American agriculture, Lighthizer told Grassley.
Ironically, the only three U.S. aluminum producers --  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA) Corp., Century Aluminum (NASDAQ:CENX) Co. and Magnitude 7 Metals LLC -- disagree whether tariffs should be reimposed.
The American Primary Aluminum Association, which represents  Century Aluminum Co  . and Magnitude 7 Metals LLC., has asked Lighthizer to reimpose a 10% tariff on imports of Canadian aluminum, saying a rise in metal coming from the country has caused the price to collapse.
The Aluminum Association of the U.S., which represents Alcoa Corp., Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Group and dozens of other aluminum parts makers, argues that imports are virtually unchanged since 2017.
Alcoa CFO William Oplinger said at a virtual bank conference in June that China’s overcapacity subsidized by the government is the real problem, and that he supports free trade with “those who trade freely, especially the Canadians.”

(Reuters) - The global advertising industry is expected to decline nearly 12% this year as the coronavirus pandemic batters businesses around the world, a report on the sector said on Monday.
The advertising market, which typically tracks the broader health of economies, was thrown into chaos in March, as people stayed home and businesses shut their doors to stop the spread of the virus.
However, while the overall hit to economies from the pandemic is expected to be worse that the 2008 financial crisis, the report from ad agency GroupM, a unit of holding company WPP (L:WPP), showed, said this year's advertising decline, excluding U.S. political advertising, would still only be modest.
That's because the small businesses that bore the brunt of the coronavirus lockdowns already accounted for a smaller portion of the advertising industry, the agency said.
The ad market decline is also softened because many businesses ""are fighting to stay alive via ecommerce, and you would expect to see some advertising through that,"" said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at GroupM, in an interview.
The hardest-hit parts of the industry are expected to be television advertising, which has long been losing ground, and ""out-of-home"" (OOH) advertising such as billboards, as people stay indoors. TV advertising is expected to decline 17.6% this year, while OOH will drop 25%, when excluding political ads, GroupM said.
The ad agency also estimated digital advertising will decline 2.3% this year and will account for 52% of the advertising market, up from 48% last year. Advertisers have invested more on digital ads because it is generally cheaper than TV and easier to start or cancel an ad campaign.
A global ad market recovery is expected to begin next year with 8.2% growth, GroupM projected.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is expected to compile a stimulus package to boost the economy in the autumn, as its previous two packages were aimed at preventing firms and households from bankruptcy amid the coronavirus pandemic, a close ally of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said. 
Akira Amari, head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's tax panel, said in an interview with Reuters on Monday that it was not out of the question that Abe could call a snap election this fall before his term as the premier ends next September.
Support for Abe has fallen due to dissatisfaction with his handling of the pandemic, his attempt to extend top prosecutors' retirement age, an arrest of an ex-justice minister and suspicions of wasteful public spending in programmes to support tourism and small companies.
Amid deepening damage to his popularity, there has been some speculation Abe may call a snap election. 
""The government is expected to compile a full-scale economic stimulus package to support growth this fall as the previous two were to protect lives, jobs and firms. In that sense, comprehensive steps to boost the economy are not in place yet,"" Amari said.
""The chance is not zero that the premier will seek the public mandate with pledging a full-scale economic package this fall.""
Abe said last week that he was not at all thinking of calling a snap election but would not hesitate to do so if needed.
The government has compiled two stimulus packages so far totalling $2.2 trillion to ease damage caused by the coronavirus crisis but over half of the respondents to a Reuters survey were critical of the response.
Amari, a former economy minister, played a key role in the premier's ""Abenomics"" policy, a mix of aggressive fiscal, monetary stimulus and pro-growth steps. He said he would disagree with the idea of cutting Japan's sales tax to help the economy but cash payouts would be more effective. 

Asked about Japan's ballooning public debt, which is the highest among advanced economies, Amari said discussions of primary budget balance would be a long way off.

A Women in Finance charter was launched in 2016 by the finance ministry in a bid to improve diversity in the financial sector where just 14% of executive committee members were women in 2015.
More than 370 firms with over 900,000 employees in total have signed up to the charter and commit themselves to voluntary diversity targets.
A review by New Financial think tank of 187 of the firms found that only a third have met or exceeded their own targets.
Women make up 32% of senior management on average, still short of the 33% minimum target the finance ministry would like to see for all signatories, the review said.
""I am determined to see the financial services sector make progress on this,"" Britain's financial services minister John Glen said in a statement. 
The review found that only 26 signatories have set themselves the goal of parity between men and women in senior roles, and that nearly 60% of firms have set a target of 33% or above for female representation.
""The COVID crisis has shown just how quickly companies can adapt,"" New Financial said. ""There is an opportunity now to challenge legacy thinking in all areas (not just flexible working), cement diversity as a strategic business priority and accelerate the pace of change.""
Catherine McGuinness, leader of the City of London financial district, said: ""This review shows signatories are moving in the right direction, but we need to increase the pace.""

A third of signatories believe that linking pay to diversity targets has been effective.

All but one of the 17 analysts polled predicted the central bank would keep rates steady at its regular monetary policy committee meeting on Thursday. The one dissenting analyst forecast a 100 bps cut.
The overnight lending rate is currently 10.25% and the overnight deposit rate 9.25%, the lowest rates since early 2016, before Egypt embarked on a three-year, International Monetary Fund-backed economic reform programme.
""The trend in inflation is favourable, at least in the short term, and a further cut will not do much for supporting economic activity at the present time,"" said Pascal Devaux, an economist with BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
Egypt's annual urban consumer price inflation slowed to 4.7% in May from 5.9% in April, the official statistics agency CAPMAS said. Core inflation, which strips out volatile items such as food, fell to 1.5% year-on-year in May from 2.5% in April, according to central bank data.
""More importantly, even with IMF support, the external situation in Egypt is less comfortable than before given a rising current account deficit and more uncertain capital flow. So there is a need to keep the attractiveness of the Egyptian debt for foreign investors and support EGP (the Egyptian pound currency),"" Devaux said.
The coronavirus has ravaged some of Egypt's main sources of foreign currency. The tourism industry has all but shut down since mid-March and remittances from workers abroad have slowed.
The government says tourism represents 5% of GDP, but analysts say the figure may be as high as 15% if indirect jobs and spending as well as investment are included.
The IMF last month approved a $2.77 billion package through its Rapid Financing Instrument designed to help Egypt close its balance of payments gap.
The lender's board is scheduled to consider on Friday yet another $5.2 billion in financing under a stand-by arrangement which has already been approved at staff level.
The central bank left interest rates on hold at its last two meetings after having slashed them by 3 percentage points at an unscheduled meeting in March as a pre-emptive move to support the economy in the face of the COVID-19 outbreak.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A quick response and targeted containment for future waves of COVID-19 will be needed to prevent ""a very large setback"" caused by another round of broad-based shutdowns, Tiff Macklem said on Monday, in his first speech as Bank of Canada governor.
The Canadian economy was hammered as officials shut down all nonessential businesses across the country to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Businesses have begun to reopen, but Macklem warned the recovery will be long and slow.
""There are going to be outbreaks as the economy reopens, we’re seeing this around the world,"" Macklem said, responding to an audience question about a second wave. ""The key is going to be responding quickly and trying to contain those.""
Macklem said Canada will need good contact tracing, testing, and the ability to implement localized shutdowns.
""If we can’t do that ... we’re going to have to get back to broad-based containment and that will be a very large setback."" He later noted the Bank is not including a second economy-wide shutdown in its scenarios.
Macklem earlier said the pandemic is likely to inflict some lasting damage to supply and demand, with supply likely to be restored more quickly than demand, which could put ""a lot of downward pressure on inflation.""
""Our main concern is to avoid a persistent drop in inflation by helping Canadians get back to work,"" Macklem said, adding that the Bank's 2% inflation target remains its beacon.
Macklem also reiterated that the bank's policy interest rate of 0.25% is at its effective lower bound, adding the central bank feels moving rates into negative territory could distort the behavior of financial institutions.
With financial markets functioning better, Macklem said the bank's bond-buying program is providing stimulus to the economy by keeping a lid on long-term rates.
The Canadian dollar  tracked stocks higher, rising 0.5% on the day to 1.3540 to the U.S. dollar, or 73.86 U.S. cents. 

Money markets do not expect further rate moves this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday placed limits on the Securities and Exchange Commission's practice of forcing defendants to surrender profits obtained through fraud as part of its enforcement of investor-protection laws in federal courts. 
The court reaffirmed the agency's authority to seek disgorgement, a part of its civil enforcement arsenal aimed at passing on funds acquired in fraudulent schemes to the original investors. 
But the 8-1 ruling, authored by liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, limited the scope of what can be sought via disgorgement to no more than the net profits of the conduct at issue. The court also decided that disgorgement generally must go to investors.
""Today's decision allows us to continue to strip wrongdoers of their ill-gotten gains and return money to its rightful owners,"" an SEC spokesperson said.
The decision came in an appeal by a California couple, Charles Liu and Xin Wang, of a 2016 SEC civil action brought against them in federal court. The justices sent the case back to lower courts for certain unresolved legal issues to be considered.
Gregory Rapawy, a lawyer for the couple, said he was pleased the court ""clarified that traditional equitable principles limit the SEC's authority to seek an award of net profits for the benefit of victims.""
The SEC had ordered the couple to disgorge almost $27 million, the amount they raised from foreign investors for a cancer treatment center that was never built.
The couple raised money from 50 foreign investors on the understanding they would be able to obtain U.S. visas. Under the EB-5 visa program, wealthy foreigners can access visas in exchange for investing at least $500,000 in certain job-creating U.S. projects.

The SEC has said that in the most recent full fiscal year it collected $1.5 billion via disgorgement and penalties and paid $1.2 billion to harmed investors. Liu and Wang had argued that Congress never gave the SEC authority to seek disgorgement.

Speaking to reporters after talks in Berlin, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz and his French counterpart Bruno Le Maire said they were confident that a deal on the European Recovery Fund could be reached soon, ideally at an EU summit next month.
""It's time to decide, we have everything on the table to support our economies and the quicker the better,"" Le Maire said.
""Having strong economies in the single market is of course an advantage for all the members of the EU,"" Le Maire added.
Le Maire said Germany and France both agreed that the European Recovery Fund should pay out the proposed funds of at least 500 billion euros from 2020 until 2022 - and not until 2024 as suggested by some member states.
Scholz and Le Maire also discussed how to rescue stalled negotiations on global corporate taxation and international tax rules for big digital companies after the United States quit talks and stoked fears of a new trade war.
Nearly 140 countries are involved in the talks organised by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on the first major rewrite of global tax rules in a generation to bring them up to date for the digital era.
Scholz said he was confident an OECD agreement could be reached by the end of the year despite Washington's announcement it would pull out of negotiations on a global digital services tax.

Le Maire said it was now up to the United States to explain why Washington was the only country not supporting the OECD's joint proposal.

Some 26 of 27 analysts predicted the Bank of Mexico's board would cut the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 5.00% when it meets for its next monetary policy meeting on Thursday. One forecast a cut of 25 points.  
Reducing the rate to 5.00% would take it to the lowest level since September 2016 and mark a ninth consecutive cut. 
By the end of 2020, the median forecast of analysts was for the key rate to be 4.50%. That was below a year-end prediction for 4.75% made in the previous monetary policy survey in May.
Mexico entered a recession in 2019 and the economy is expected to shrink by up to 10% or more this year. Industrial output suffered a record contraction in April, declining by more than 25% compared to the previous month.
Further bolstering the case for a rate cut is the fact inflation remains below the central bank's 3% target. In May, the rate picked up less than forecast to 2.84%.

The central bank is due to publish its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday at 1300 local time (1800 GMT).

""The ECOWAS authority of heads of state and government...calls on other African countries as well as non-African countries to endorse her candidature,"" the document, signed by Niger's President and ECOWAS chairman Mahamadou Issoufou said, referring to Nigeria's Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.
It was dated June 19 but was not finalised until Monday.
Brazil's Roberto Azevedo is stepping down as WTO head a year early at the end of August. 
His successor will need to steer reforms and negotiations in the face of rising protectionism, a deep recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and growing trade tensions, notably between the United States and China.
There is broad support for an African candidate and a woman, since neither have headed the Geneva-based body in the past, sources following the process said. Supporters of Okonjo-Iweala, a former minister and World Bank managing director, vaunt her negotiating skills, including clinching a multi-billion dollar debt relief package for Nigeria.
Africa has previously struggled to unite behind one WTO candidate and this time has so far been no different.
The African Union (AU) was due to officially endorse one of three pre-selected candidates from Benin, Egypt and Nigeria.
But the process was disrupted by COVID-19 measures and Nigeria swapped its candidate this month, prompting Egypt to protest to the AU, sources following the process said.
The latter found that Nigeria had broken AU rules by changing its submission, a document showed. An AU official declined to comment.

Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala's spokeswoman said: ""Dr. Ngozi's goal is to earn the support of all African countries, and she's humbled by the support she's already received. There is time for most if not all of Africa to unite behind one candidate.""

WARSAW/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union could soften demands in trade talks that Britain follow its state aid rules, diplomats and officials have said, just as the bloc's own splurge to cushion the hit from the coronavirus has stretched its competition rules.
EU sources following Brexit described seeking a compromise as Brussels and Britain, which left the bloc in January, intensify talks on their relationship from 2021, when London's standstill transition agreement ends. 
The negotiations have so far made little progress. Britain wants a trade deal with no tariffs or quotas and few strings, while the EU wants a closer alliance that would also cover security, climate and transport, and to align regulations closely between the world's largest trading bloc and its fifth biggest economy.
State aid goes to the heart of a particularly key contentious issue: the ""level playing field"" guarantees of fair competition.
The EU says they are essential to open its cherished single market of 450 million people to British products without the risk of being undercut by laxer standards. 
London rejects being bound by EU state aid rules since escaping the bloc's laws and jurisdiction was a major Brexit promise to voters.
LANDING ZONE
The 27 EU member states' joint negotiating mandate stipulates that the United Kingdom should follow the bloc's state aid rules in the future, a notion Britain's negotiator David Frost called ""particularly egregious"". 
An EU diplomat following Brexit talks in Brussels also said it was ""unattainable"".
""A possible 'landing zone' could be taking a snapshot at the end of the transition period to define common standards from which the sides would not slip,"" the diplomat said.
Sam Lowe, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, said the EU could assess whether UK rules, rather then being identical, achieved a similar effect to its own. 
""The EU would still have the possibility to guard itself by reinserting tariffs in future,"" he said. 
An EU official dealing with Brexit dismissed the idea of such tariffs, but said the bloc was looking to narrow the gap:
""On state aid, it's authorities committing not to rig the game. It's not saying you can't ever intervene. But the EU is saying: 'We have to have the same philosophy and approach for the future'.""
EU member states' recent state aid bonanza - during which the bloc's executive approved more than 2.2 trillion euros in support schemes to companies struggling under the coronavirus downturn - has highlighted how dynamic the area is.

""It's hard to talk about something like rules of state aid with the UK while everything is shifting in the European Union itself,"" said Gabriel Felbermayr, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.

956,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>",Pandemic propels old-school bond traders towards an electronic future,"By Dhara Ranasinghe and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - The mammoth bond market has long been the old-school bastion of the financial world, but the COVID-19 pandemic has cast a light on its future - and it looks electronic. Well, mainly.
At the height of the market panic in March, Seattle-based Brandon Rasmussen, a senior fixed-income trader at $300 billion asset manager Russell Investments, had a client order to sell $2.5 billion worth of U.S. Treasuries.
He found, though, that such a transaction was near-impossible in a highly volatile market that made no exceptions for even one of the world's most sought-after assets.
Dealers refused to quote prices by phone, adding to the stress of executing a large order without distorting the market.
The solution Rasmussen eventually settled on was to break the order up into smaller chunks and process them electronically - something he may not have considered a few weeks earlier. 
""The feedback that we got from dealers was that they were not quoting on the phone. They couldn't do that, they couldn't keep up with that,"" he said. ""I think what this crisis has shown is that really if you weren't trading electronically, you should be trading electronically.""
His experience illustrates how the volatility caused by the crisis, along with a new remote mindset of working from home, has pushed more traders to go digital in a market that has historically lagged stocks and forex in electronification.
That trend is reflected in the business on electronic bond-trading platforms.
For example MarketAxess, one of the biggest players, enjoyed record trading volumes in March. At rival Tradeweb, average daily turnover hit a record aggregate $1 trillion in that month, a more than 41% year-on-year increase. 
Meanwhile MTS, part of the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE), said it won several large asset managers in Europe as clients during the crisis. 
Yet traders stress that dealers and clients speaking to one another will long remain a key component of the industry, especially at times of heightened volatility.
Even as Rasmussen went electronic to push through his trade, for example, he was also talking to buyers to agree ""switches"" - swapping one type of U.S. bond for another to share risk.
The jump in electronic trading activity coincided with both a rush into government bonds as the coronavirus sparked demand for safe-haven assets, and then a sharp selloff as investors sold their most liquid assets to make up for losses elsewhere. 
Graphic: Electronic bond trading activity surges in March, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/xlbvggaqqvq/eikon.png
LIQUIDITY & TRANSPARENCY
Electronic trading - where transactions are carried out using software on online platforms, rather than via dealer-client ""voice"" trades - can carry major benefits for the $100 trillion-plus world of government and corporate debt.
Regulations such as MiFID II in Europe to improve transparency have also boosted electronic trading.
For one, traders executing deals can quickly gauge market depth on their screens, freeing time for more complex trades. For another, it offers lower costs for investors; two dealers estimated it to be 10%-30% cheaper than traditional voice trades.
Nonetheless, while most bond industry players acknowledge that much of the future is digital, many have been reluctant to go fully electronic.
Around 45% of the European fixed-income market is electronically traded, versus 38% a year ago, consultancy Greenwich Associates estimates. In the $6.6 trillion-a-day currency market, 90% of spot trading is conducted digitally. 
However the COVID-19 crisis is accelerating the electronification of the bond market, according to industry players.
Many such as Tony Rodriguez, U.S.-based head of fixed income strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, said a need for greater liquidity had boosted electronic trading activity. 
""A lot of trades were pushed electronically because of greater liquidity and transparency - so the crisis pushed what was already in place,"" he said. 
Andrew Falco, global head of FX and fixed income trading at Fidelity International in London credits electronic trading with allowing connectivity in a market suddenly dispersed by remote working.
This kind of technology enabled the transition from working in an office to working from kitchen tables, he told Reuters.
He said some lessons had been learned about this last year when Fidelity's Hong Kong team struggled to work in the office because of the unrest roiling the city.
""So for us in 2020, we finessed the e-trading home set-up and ensured it worked well, whether it was in HK, Shanghai, Dublin or the UK,"" he added.
Graphic: etrading impact on bond market liquidity - Greenwich, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopakgedpa/Greenwich1606B.PNG
'IMAGINE THIS 25 YEARS AGO'
For the banks who provide dealer and execution services, though, the electronic shift may be eating into fixed-income revenues; during the March quarter, earnings from bond trading at the world's biggest 12 banks remained below levels seen in 2014, research firm Coalition calculates.
But they too are accelerating the push to digital services, particularly for the automation that helps them when volatility spikes. 
JP Morgan, for instance, uses an algorithm to help generate price quotes on its forward FX platform, which includes bonds, fielding ""hundreds of thousands of enquiries"" and transacting ""thousands of trades a day"" during the crisis, said Tom Prickett, co-head of EMEA rates at the bank.
Another big player, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), said clients ramped up calls for the electronification and automation of companies' bond sales, until now a slow process conducted manually.
""The crisis revealed some of those shortcomings in bright lights,"" said David Wilkins, Goldman's head of FICC execution services in EMEA.
Investors and traders acknowledged that digital technology had been a saviour during the pandemic, a view expressed across a host of industries.
""Imagine something like this happening 25 years ago, when emails didn't exist, electronic communication was not really there,"" said Zoeb Sachee, head of euro linear rates trading at Citibank who oversees government bond trading in European markets.
THE OLD AND THE NEW
But, for the foreseeable future at least, the bond market is likely to encompass the old and the new: technology as well as traditional trading models based on dealer-client relationships.
Traders of European investment-grade corporate bonds during the crisis often negotiated deals by phone before using a platform to settle, according to an International Capital Market Association (ICMA) report.
""Bond markets are very much relationship-driven and I don't see how that goes away,"" said report author Andy Hill. 
This was echoed by Falco at Fidelity.
""The view that we felt as a team was that we would use technology where we had confidence in the price that we could see on the screen, and when we didn't have the confidence in the price, we would execute manually.""

ROME (Reuters) - Italy is preparing a new spending package worth 15-20 billion euros to help its battered economy through the coronavirus crisis, which will push its budget deficit beyond 11% of national output, a government source told Reuters.
The new package, which must be approved by parliament, will involve additional borrowing and drive Italy's public debt towards 157% of national output from the 155.7% currently targeted, the source added.
""We need to boost funds to supplement the income of workers temporarily laid off and support local authorities whose tax revenues were hit by the lockdown,"" said the source, citing some of the uses the new borrowing would be put to.
The Treasury declined to comment.
The COVID-19 outbreak first confirmed on Feb. 21 has killed more than 34,600 Italians, putting it among countries hardest hit by the pandemic. The Treasury estimates the economy will contract by at least 8% this year due to lockdown measures.
Looking to soften the recession, Rome has already adopted measures set to raise the deficit by 75 billion euros ($84.12 billion) this year to 10.4% of national output. Last year's budget gap was just 1.6%, its lowest for 12 years.
Italy's public debt as a proportion of GDP is the euro zone's largest after that of Greece. 
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Sunday the government was studying new measures to help struggling sectors such as tourism while it awaited help from European Union initiatives for the countries worst-hit by the coronavirus.
The government also plans to provide additional resources for a state-backed fund that shields banks from losses on loans to small- and medium-sized companies, Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said last week.
Ahead of the new stimulus, to be approved in July, Rome has so far pledged up to 180 billion euros of economic help for families and firms, including state guarantees on banking loans, but much less is likely to be actually spent. 
The government will seek authorisation from parliament to increase the 2020 budget deficit, the source said.

The special tax was introduced in 2012 after the global financial crisis to create a buffer fund to help cope with future crises. It has raised about 150 million euros a year. 
""We have agreed to introduce an entirely new scheme instead of the bank tax,"" Prime Minister Igor Matovic told a televised news conference.
Under the new plan to be proposed to parliament, accumulated payments of the tax, amounting to about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), would be moved into a state development fund, he said. 
Future payments would be scrapped and banks would instead use the cash saved to boost capital, enabling them to lend about 500 million euros for public projects each year and a further 1 billion euros on private projects, Matovic said. 
Alexander Resch, the head of the euro zone country's banking association, told the joint news conference with Matovic that banks backed the move.
""This will release resources necessary to increase our capital in order to give more loans to families, households and in the end ... support the Slovak economy with roughly 1.5 billion euros in additional loans per year,"" he said.
The levy had faced criticism especially after the previous government doubled the rate from this year. The central bank said in April the higher rate would take half of bank profits.
The central bank welcomed the move to scrap the tax and to encourage lending instead. ""Common sense has won,"" Governor Peter Kazimir said in a statement.
Slovakia's top banks include KBC Group's CSOB (BR:KBC), Erste Group Bank's Slovenska Sporitelna (VI:ERST), Raiffeisen's Tatra Banka (VI:RBIV) and  Intesa Sanpaolo 's VUB (MI:ISP).

Up to another 300,000 New York City residents will head back to work on Monday as the city enters phase 2 of its reopening in the wake of its battle with the Covid-19 coronavirus.
The new phase of reopening includes in-store retail, hair salons, offices, real estate, vehicle sales, rentals and leases, commercial building management and retail rental, repair and cleaning.
Mayor Bill de Blasio has approved restaurants to use sidewalks or kerbside parking spaces for outdoor dining, amid evidence that viral transmission is much lower outdoors. All establishments must still follow social distancing rules, with masks required of both staff and customers when they are within six feet of people.
New York was hit worse than any other part of the U.S. by the virus’ first wave, the worst affected region of the U.S., accounting for around one quarter of the 120,000 U.S. deaths recorded so far during the pandemic.
2. Virus recedes in Beijing, advances in LatAm and U.S. Sunbelt
New York isn’t the only place relaxing its Covid rules today. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also expected to announce fresh measures to reopen the economy. In addition, the Chinese capital of Beijing reported only seven new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, suggesting that its typically robust reaction to last week’s outbreak has had positive effects.
However, the virus hasn’t gone away. Brazil passed the 50,000 milestone for deaths at the weekend, while Mexico, which began reopening its economy last week, posted its second-highest daily number of new cases.
Across the U.S. ‘sun belt’ too, case numbers have continued to rise, with California, Florida and Texas all reporting over 4,000 new cases on Sunday.
At his first re-election campaign rally on Friday, President Donald Trump said he had told his aides to slow down the rate of testing for Covid-19, a comment that his aides subsequently played down as “light-hearted”.
3. Stocks set to open higher 
U.S. stocks are set to open higher, with the reopening narrative dominating the second-wave fears that pushed major indices lower on Friday.
By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract was up 191 points, or 0.8%, while the S&P 500 Futures and Nasdaq 100 futures contracts were up in line.
Of interest later in the day will be Apple’s annual Worldwide Developer Conference, where the company is expected to confirm a move to make its own chips for the next generation of Mac computers. The meeting is expected to be overshadowed by a brewing dispute with app developers over the terms of access to its App Store.
The European Union last week opened an antitrust investigation into possible abuse of a dominant market position. That didn’t stop the stock hitting new all-time highs, however.
4. Wirecard fights for survival 
One of Europe’s brightest tech hopes was fighting for survival on Monday after fresh disclosures about accounting fraud at the company over the weekend.
German payments company Wirecard said that some $2.1 billion of cash it had claimed to have on its balance sheet in trustee accounts in the Philippines had probably never existed.
The central bank governor of the Philippines said at the weekend that the funds had never entered the country’s payments system.
The company pulled its financial statements for the last year and warned it may have to do the same for previous years’ too. It’s still trying to persuade lenders not to terminate some $2 billion in loans, something that would likely push it into insolvency.
5. Oil consolidates as rig count hits new low
U.S. crude oil prices consolidated just below the $40 level, pausing for breath after last week’s rally amid lingering concern that a second wave of coronavirus infections could derail the recovery in oil demand.
By 6:30, U.S. crude futures were down 0.3% at $39.73 a barrel, while the global benchmark Brent was down 0.1% at $42.13 a barrel.
On Friday, oilfield services company Baker Hughes had said that the number of active oil rigs in the U.S. fell to its lowest in 11 years, strengthening perceptions of a cap on U.S. output in the near term.
Elsewhere on Monday, there were fresh indications of lingering overhang of supply, as India – one of the world’s largest importers - said it had filled its strategic petroleum reserve.

962,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>","Eerie Calm Settles On Housing Market, Defying Doomsayers for now","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. housing market, which seemed headed off a cliff in April, now looks like it’s returning to some semblance of normal. The quiet may not last long.
The initial chaos caused by the coronavirus pandemic has given way to an eerie calm, housing-industry executives say. Unemployment is near record highs, yet home prices keep rising. Lenders that in March warned of imminent collapse are now getting crushed by a surge in mortgage applications. Even some private-mortgage issuers, which don’t have government backing and are typically the most risk-averse in a recession, have come back into the market and say their mortgage-bond offerings have been oversubscribed.
But even amid the welcome surprise, there are signs some homeowners and renters are hanging on by a thread. Many Americans who have lost a job say they’re continuing to make rent or mortgage payments but aren’t certain how long that can last.
“With such elevated levels of unemployment, many households are experiencing very challenging financial distress,” said CoreLogic chief economist Frank Nothaft. “Without some additional program or support, whether at the federal or state level, they will have a lot of difficulty meeting all their payments.”
Bleeding Stanched
Much of the initial bleeding was stanched by the $2.2 trillion stimulus package passed by Congress in March. In addition to billions of dollars given to small businesses to maintain payrolls, Congress increased unemployment benefits by $600 per week. The law also allows borrowers with a government-backed mortgage to delay payments for as long as a year if they claim a pandemic-related hardship.
The various programs were more than enough to keep most renters and borrowers on track. Some Americans are receiving more money from federal pandemic payments than they did from their jobs.
Calls to Apprisen, an Ohio-based nonprofit credit counseling service, are down 11% from a year earlier. Financial counselor Sarah Gardner said the weekly $600 pandemic payment made many struggling homeowners ineligible for a federal mortgage-assistance program she used before the pandemic.
But with the $600-per-week set to expire at the end of July, there are signs homeowners and renters could slip.
About 9.1 million borrowers told the Census Bureau in June that they had not made last month’s mortgage payment after their household lost employment income during the pandemic. But 10.7 million said they had slight to no confidence that they’d make their payment next month.
Declining Confidence
Renters are even more on edge. About one in four rental households that lost income said they missed last month’s rent payment, according to the Census. One in three said they have little to no confidence they’ll pay next month.
Doug Bibby, president of the National Multifamily Housing Council, said he went into April “terrified” of how spiking unemployment would hurt his trade group’s members, which are predominantly apartment-leasing firms. “I was expecting the worst. I really was. We got through April. I thought this can’t keep going in May. The May numbers were better,” he said.
Anecdotally, the group’s members say the enhanced unemployment benefits approved by Congress through July 31 have kept renters paying even if they lost income.
If those benefits end without replacement, “we’re really concerned,” said Caitlin Walter, the trade group’s vice president of research.
When Congress passed the law allowing mortgage borrowers to skip payments for as long as a year, a mortgage industry trade group predicted as many as one in four loans would enter forbearance programs.
Instead, the forbearance rate has stalled at about 8.7%, according to real-estate data firm Black Knight (NYSE:BKI) Inc. What’s more, many borrowers who asked for forbearance have kept making mortgage payments anyway, servicers say.
“It turned out to be a better situation than we all anticipated,” said Bill Banfield, executive vice president of capital markets for Quicken Loans Inc. Banfield said Quicken and other firms have seen upwards of 40% of borrowers in forbearance continue to pay.
At Mr. Cooper Group Inc., one of the nation’s biggest mortgage companies, the daily number of homeowners entering forbearance has fallen by about 90%, and more borrowers are exiting forbearance plans than entering, said Chief Credit Officer Kurt Johnson.
Mat Ishbia, chief executive officer of United Wholesale Mortgage, reckons that low interest rates and pent up demand will fuel an economic comeback, and the next 12 months could mark the best year in the history of U.S. housing. The “great, great majority” of borrowers facing hardship now will soon find their footing and resume paying off their mortgages, he said.
Households Preparing
Much of that prediction stems from clear signs that households are getting their finances in order to prepare for the risk of a prolonged recession. They’ve largely shunned additional borrowing and instead have paid down their debt, according to credit bureau  TransUnion  (NYSE:TRU).
Matt Komos, who leads the company’s U.S. financial services research and consulting, said borrower behavior during the pandemic suggests that even if the economy worsens “they’re going to do whatever they can to keep their homes.”
But there’s concern about what could happen later this year.
For one, even though the forbearance rate has flattened, more borrowers in forbearance programs are starting to miss their payments. In April, 46% of borrowers in forbearance still paid their mortgage. By the end of May, that had fallen to 28%, and by June 15, just 15% of borrowers had made their payment for this month, according to Black Knight.
Even if borrowers manage to survive the initial shock of enhanced unemployment benefits ending, there could be renewed stress next year.
Unlike a decade ago, when about one in four borrowers owed more on their homes than they were worth, now nearly 97% have equity in their homes, according to CoreLogic. So if they can’t make their mortgage payments, they’re more likely to try to sell their homes than default. If many borrowers try to do that at once when their forbearance ends next year, that could lead to a crush of homes for sale and declining prices, Mr. Cooper’s Johnson said.
Dennis Lee, who analyzes mortgages at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), reckons that 15% to 25% of borrowers in forbearance eventually will default, an estimate he arrived at after studying past episodes of financial distress.
Defaults Quadruple
CoreLogic estimates defaults in some mortgages would quadruple by 2022 under its baseline economic scenario, in which unemployment peaks this year at just more than 15%.
Robert Perry, who oversees investment strategy at financial advisory firm ALM First Group LLC, doesn’t think losses will approach the levels of the last financial crisis. Over the past decade, lenders have given mortgages largely to borrowers with sterling credit who could afford hefty down payments, and rising home prices over the last several years has meant record levels of home equity.
About 80% of borrowers postponing their payments have at least 20% equity in their homes, according to Black Knight, giving creditors some comfort that a surge of defaults may not wreck their bottom lines.
Those homeowners who owe about as much as their properties are worth are “the corner of the box everyone has a circle around,” Perry said.

Rutte has led a coalition of fiscally conservative northern European countries opposed to the proposed recovery fund, which would see the EU raise debt and transfer cash to the countries hardest hit by the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis.
Rutte, who wants the transfers to take the form of repayable loans rather than grants, will host a meeting with Macron in The Hague, followed by a working dinner, Macron's office said. 
The talks will mainly focus on the EU budget and the recovery fund.

A source familiar with the meeting said Macron and Rutte are also likely to discuss Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF), as the two governments tussle for influence over the Franco-Dutch airline group.

965,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 05:27AM ET</span>",Virus Surge Jolts Prospects for World Economy,"(Bloomberg) --
The global economy’s fragile recovery is facing a fresh hurdle as a surge in coronavirus cases threatens to keep businesses closed and consumers on edge.
Cases of the deadly virus rose by a record for a single day on June 21, according to the World Health Organization, with flare ups across the U.S. and new scares in Germany and Australia. While China said the latest outbreak in Beijing is under control, other large emerging economies including Brazil, India and Indonesia continue to see cases soar.
“The fight is nowhere close to being over,” said Tuuli McCully, the Singapore-based head of Asia Pacific economics at Scotiabank. “A second significant wave of infections in advanced economies is a huge risk for the global economy that is still in very early stages of recovery.”
The concern comes as high frequency data tracked by Bloomberg Economics had been showing an improving picture for sectors such as transport and dining out as lockdown restrictions are eased. A sustained pickup in virus cases threatens to undermine or even reverse those trends.
U-Shape
The International Monetary Fund this week is set to unveil new forecasts for a world already facing its worst outlook since the Great Depression. While the easing of lockdown restrictions in parts of Europe and the U.S. had led some economists to envisage a V-shaped recovery for the world, the re-acceleration in the virus argues against any swift revival.
“The flare-up tilts the risks from a V-shaped recovery to a U-shaped recovery,” said Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) Chief Economist Torsten Slok.
European stocks fell early on Monday, but later pared losses as investors bet that the economic recovery will keep going. Gold continued its march toward a 2012 high.
An improvement in consumer confidence will be at the core of the recovery sequence if business investment and employment is to heal, according to Catherine Mann,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). chief economist and former chief economist for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The latest outbreak won’t help that outlook.
“This is not a picture of recovery that is satisfactory in any way, shape or form,” she told the Australian National University’s Crawford Leadership Forum Monday.
In recent weeks, an easing of lockdowns had allowed activity to recover. Bright spots in China include new house prices, which rose at the fastest pace in seven months in May as the coronavirus shutdowns were unwound. Consumer demand, industrial output and investment also showed improvement.
Early South Korea export figures -- typically held up as a gauge of global demand -- show shipment declines easing in June amid resilient semiconductor demand and more purchases from China. Average daily shipments fell 16% in the first 20 days of the month compared with the prior year, improving from a decline that exceeded 20% in May.
In the U.S., unemployment has hinted at bottoming out and retail sales surged by a record in May from the prior month, offering some hope of a quicker recovery from the pandemic-induced recession.
In the euro area, measures of activity have slowly improved from their trough in April. Business confidence in Germany is on the mend, and figures in France show the economy there is now running about 12% below normal levels, compared with 29% at the peak of the lockdown. The purchasing managers indexes for the region have risen, though continue to signal contractions in manufacturing and services.
Still, until there’s a vaccine, there won’t be a full recovery.
Policy makers will need to remain alert to the need for more support, Warwick McKibbin of the Brookings Institution and Australia National University, who has modeled the macro-economic impact of the virus, told the Crawford Leadership Forum Monday.
Almost $11 trillion of fiscal resources has been approved globally since the crisis began, with an extra $5 trillion still in the pipeline, according to the Institute of International Finance.
“We are nowhere near the end of this pandemic,” McKibbin said.

966,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>",Model misbehaviour: coronavirus confounds bank risk systems,"By Lawrence White and Sinead Cruise
LONDON (Reuters) - The novel coronavirus has upended how banks manage lending risk, with decades of data rendered moot by a once-in-a-lifetime mix of global economic shutdowns, unprecedented government support and an uncertain path to recovery.
Lenders are scrambling for new insights as systems that rely on historical default data to model risk struggle to capture how the pandemic has disrupted the long-term prospects for swathes of the economy.
The problem is particularly acute where the virus is reshaping whole industries such as travel, hospitality and sport. Government support schemes that are propping up some firms are also clouding the outlook. 
""The one thing that I have learned in 34 years in banking is that credit risk models and scorecards will work really, really well except when there is a significant abnormal shock,"" said Noel Quinn, Chief Executive of HSBC (L:HSBA).
""We just had one of the most significant abnormal shocks ever.""
Banks will have to reassess how they model, Quinn said, replacing broad geographical assessments with more detailed industry and sub-sector specific systems.
One example would be a British pub with a beer garden. It will likely be able to serve many more customers than one with only indoor space under social distancing rules - a brighter prospect unlikely to be captured by existing models. 
TECH SOLUTIONS
Banks in the U.S. and Europe, which are far more robust than they were at the onset of the 2008 crisis thanks to years of capital-building, reported differing levels of bad loan provisions for the first quarter of this year based on their own economic forecasts, relative exposure to riskier credits and interpretation of new accounting rules.
But even if lenders could agree on those factors, the pandemic has underlined the need for smarter, more detailed and more forward-looking models to distinguish good loans from bad.
""These backward looking models are designed to tell you that you have a problem, they're not designed to tell you what you do about it,"" said Philip Hammond, a former British finance minister who now advises SoftBank Group Corp-backed (T:9984) OakNorth. 
London-based OakNorth, which specialises in lending to small businesses, is marketing a new system using data and insight from sector experts to advise banks on how individual loans in their portfolio will perform through the pandemic and its aftermath.
""Correlations in this cycle are totally different- if you don't have a forward looking way of looking at risk, you're not looking at your risk properly,"" said Chief Executive Rishi Khosla.
PNC Bank (N:PNC) in the United States is already using the software, the two lenders announced earlier this month, while other big banks such as  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) are looking to build or update their models in partnership with fintech firms.
""There is a regular hunt to...see if (new technology) can provide better insights than the historical data, by looking at multiple sectors and linking the data together,"" said Andy Halford, Chief Financial Officer at Standard Chartered.
HIDDEN RISKS
In Britain, regulators have told banks that when making provisions, they must forecast whether a borrower taking a mortgage payment holiday is likely to face a longer-term cashflow problem.
One in six mortgages in Britain are now subject to payment deferrals, according to data from industry body UK Finance.
Banks have to calculate which payments are likely to resume without a clear picture of which borrowers will keep their jobs as the government's furlough scheme potentially only delays layoffs. 
Data compiled by consulting firm EY shows that European banks' cost of risk, a measure of the rate of loan losses in a portfolio, trebled from its level at the end of 2019 between January and March, albeit only to one percent.
But the rate is set to rise further, analysts said, since the period only captured the very start of the economic shutdown in Europe.
The uncertainty created by the new environment may also offer good lending opportunities which banks could miss if traditional models flag such clients as too risky.
That could stymie the recovery for both banks and borrowers alike.
""The back history here is not going to be a predictor of the future - trying to model coming out of a virus is not easy,"" StanChart's Halford said.

967,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>",Coronavirus doing almost double the debt damage as financial crash: Moody's,"LONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus will push debt levels in the world's richest nations up by almost 20 percentage points on average this year, credit rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said on Monday, almost double the damage seen during the financial crash.
A new report by Moody's looked at 14 countries from the United States and Japan to Italy and Britain and assessed how coronavirus-induced economic slowdowns would scar their finances.
""We estimate that on average in this group, government debt/GDP ratios will rise by around 19 percentage points, nearly twice as much as in 2009 during the Great Financial Crisis"".
""Compared with the GFC, the rise in debt burdens will be more immediate and pervasive, reflecting the acuteness and breadth of the shock posed by the coronavirus"".
Italy, Japan and Britain are expected to suffer the biggest debt increases at around 25 percentage points of their respective GDPs, while the United States, France, Spain, Canada and New Zealand will all see theirs jump roughly 20 ppts.
Data from the UK last week showed public borrowing hitting a record high in May and a measure of public sector debt passing 100% of economic output.
A failure to bring debt levels back down would leave countries with weaker credit profiles more vulnerable to future economic or financial shocks, and sovereign credit rating downgrades, Moody's added.
""Rating implications will depend on governments' ability to reverse debt trajectories ahead of potential future shocks,"" the report said.
""Italy and Japan will be particularly dependent on growth trends since scope to narrow and sustain materially stronger financial balances than before the shock is limited"".

970,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 03:09AM ET</span>",BOE’s Bailey Signals Dramatic Shift Toward Stimulus,"(Bloomberg) -- Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey signaled a major shift in the central bank’s strategy for removing emergency stimulus, stressing the need to reduce the institution’s balance sheet before hiking interest rates.
Writing for Bloomberg Opinion, Bailey said such a plan would give officials more firepower in future crises. The BOE’s balance sheet has swelled to almost 700 billion pounds ($864 billion) because of its extraordinary measures during the coronavirus pandemic, and is set to grow much larger because of the central bank’s bond-buying program.
Read Andrew Bailey’s full Op-Ed: Central Bank Reserves Can’t Be Taken for Granted
While the governor didn’t say whether he favors paring back that program or its lending facilities first, asset purchases make up the bulk of the BOE’s balance sheet. Before the coronavirus pandemic, Bailey’s predecessor Mark Carney said the central bank would wait until rates hit 1.5% before reducing its stock of assets.
“Elevated balance sheets could limit the room for maneuver in future emergencies,” Bailey wrote. “When the time comes to withdraw monetary stimulus, in my opinion it may be better to consider adjusting the level of reserves first without waiting to raise interest rates on a sustained basis.”
The pound briefly pared earlier gains on the comments, and traded at $1.2379 at 7:11 a.m. London time.
That message is a warning shot to the multi-trillion dollar money market industry, which should be a key source of liquidity but which started to dry up when the crisis hit, forcing the BOE to step in. The central bank has already criticized the apparent vulnerability of such funds, which faced difficulty selling assets to meet redemptions despite supposedly investing in short-term, low-risk securities.
“Rather than having to keep relying on central bank support for all aspects of the financial system, we need a robust assessment of the latter’s weaknesses,” he said. “The role of money market funds, and the risks to financial markets that they posed at the height of the disorder, is one area to examine.”
Since Bailey became governor in March, the central bank has cut rates to 0.1% and announced plans to increase its asset-purchase target by 300 billion pounds to contain the economic impact of the pandemic. It has also loaned money on generous terms to keep liquidity high.
The bond-buying will lead to an increase in the total stock of assets of at least 66% in 2020, an expansion Bailey says “mustn’t become a permanent feature.”
The financial system mustn’t become reliant on these extraordinary levels of reserves,” he said.
The governor didn’t mention negative interest rates or yield curve control. He has previously said all policy tools are still on the table and that the bank would review the impact of sub-zero borrowing costs.
The BOE may have to ease even further before it can consider reining in stimulus. The U.K. will face the greatest economic hit from the pandemic of all developed countries this year, according to the OECD.
Both the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve have massively boosted their asset-buying again this year, along with extensive lending programs. ECB policy makers have pledged to maintain their stock of purchases “for an extended period of time” past the date when officials start to raise rates.
The BOE last week increased its bond-buying plan by 100 billion pounds, bringing its total target to 745 billion pounds, the equivalent of almost 40% of U.K. gross domestic product.
A previous expansion in March has been widely credited with calming a period of intense market stress in the early days of the pandemic, and keeping a lid on bond yields as the government stepped up borrowing to fund a massive expansion in spending.
Bailey said the action “helped counteract the economic and market turmoil,” and rejected claims the buying -- which almost exactly matched the government’s extra debt sales -- compromised the BOE’s independence.
“The fact that the predominant borrowers in this emergency are governments, reflecting the essential role of the state in such a crisis, makes no difference to the underlying economics or the importance of keeping borrowing costs consistent with central-bank objectives,” he said. The BOE’s “capacity to act must be reinforced and not mistakenly called into question.”

971,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 03:00AM ET</span>","China home prices to pick up, but outlook remains soft: Reuters poll","By Lusha Zhang and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's home prices are expected to grow slightly faster this year than predicted a few months earlier while sales will stay soft, as Beijing refrains from strong easing to cushion the coronavirus-led slowdown in the sector, a Reuters poll showed.
The property market has shown some signs of recovery helped by cheaper credit and incremental policy easing as the Chinese economy emerges from its coronavirus lockdown. But still weak consumer confidence and fears of a second wave of virus infections may dampen chances for a sustainable rebound.
Average residential property prices are estimated to rise 3.75% in 2020, according to 13 analysts and economists surveyed from June 15-19.
The forecast was firmer than a 3.25% gain tipped in a February survey, but down from 6.6% growth in 2019. Home prices are seen slowing to 3% in the first half of 2021.
""As the epidemic gradually subsides and credit environment improves, home purchase demand continues to be released, which has provided effective support for housing prices,"" said Huang Yu, vice president of China Index Academy, a Beijing-based property research institute.
""Looking at the whole year, China's home prices do not have a basis for sustainable and broader gains due to uncertainties over the macro economy and the epidemic, official curbs on speculation and residents' gloomy income expectations.""
Markets in some larger cities have gained momentum on pent-up demand and easier mortgage access. A lack of investment options and some discount sales also underpinned demand from wealthy people.
Prices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen grew a faster 0.7% in May from April compared with 0.2% previously, official data showed last week.
Property transactions are expected to fell 4.5% this year, unchanged from the previous poll, and versus a 0.1% drop in 2019.
Investments are estimated to rise 5% this year, against 6% growth projected in the previous poll.
""For the second half of this year, China's housing market will encounter combined headwinds including the epidemic, economic downturn, shrinking family wealth, and level of market liquidity,"" said Daniel Yao, head of research for China at JLL, a commercial property services provider.
Most survey respondents expect smaller cities to slightly relax market curbs, while they said larger cities will likely maintain curbs or even tighten policy to avoid bubble risk.
""Tier-3 and -4 cities are facing enormous fiscal pressures as fiscal revenues fell sharply and expenditure jumped. It is hard for them to maintain the situation,"" said Sun Binyi, vice head with China Real Estate Appraisal Centre.
Asked to rate the affordability of Chinese housing on a scale, with 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive, analysts' median answer was 7, in line with the last poll.

972,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 02:55AM ET</span>",Bank of England's Bailey up-ends QE unwind policy,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Monday that the central bank should start to reverse its quantitative easing asset purchases before raising interest rates on a sustained basis, a reversal of long-standing BoE policy.
The BoE increased its bond purchase target to 745 billion pounds ($922 billion) last week, and in March it cut its main interest rate to a record low 0.1%. But Bailey said this level of central bank asset purchases ""shouldn't always be taken for granted"".
""When the time comes to withdraw monetary stimulus, in my opinion it may be better to consider adjusting the level of reserves first without waiting to raise interest rates on asustained basis,"" Bailey wrote in an article for Bloomberg.
Under its previous governor Mark Carney, the BoE said it would raise interest rates materially before starting to sell past asset purchases back to the market, as it viewed interest rates as a nimbler policy tool.
But since the 2008-09 financial crisis the BoE has never had the opportunity to raise interest rates significantly, and Bailey said he did not want high central bank holdings of government debt to become a permanent feature.
""Elevated balance sheets could limit the room for manoeuvre in future emergencies,"" he said.
Bailey also said the central bank wanted to look at the role of money market funds and the risks they had posed to financial markets at the height of recent market disorder in March.
BoE purchases of British public debt since the start of the crisis have outstripped even the record increase in government borrowing needs, prompting some suggestions - rejected by the BoE - that it is underwriting the government's spending.
""The fact that the predominant borrowers in this emergency are governments - reflecting the essential role of the state in such a crisis - makes no difference to the underlying economics or the importance of keeping borrowing costs in line with objectives,"" Bailey said.

973,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>",ECB Looks to Defuse German Legal Timebomb Threatening Stimulus,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank’s most determined attempt yet to confront the German legal headache bedeviling its quantitative easing policy may emerge as soon as this week.
That’s what its president, Christine Lagarde, hinted at after its June 4 decision, saying that the account of that meeting due to be published this Thursday will include a description of officials’ justifications for continuing the measure. A German newspaper says additional documents may also be published to support the ECB’s arguments.
Policy makers are trying to address the demands of a constitutional court ruling that criticized Germany’s politicians and the European Union’s top tribunal for not properly scrutinizing the institution’s accumulation of more than 2 trillion euros ($2.3 trillion) in public-sector debt. That judgment threatens to bar the Bundesbank from participating in monetary stimulus.
The ruling produced a standoff between the chief legal authority of Europe’s biggest economy and the ECB, which argues it’s not answerable to national tribunals or parliaments. With time pressing however, and more litigation pending, Lagarde and her colleagues have since sought to engage in the matter.
One advantage of explaining themselves in the account is that it is one of only a few regular, official documents signed off and published by the decision-making Governing Council. So policy makers can collectively respond to the judgment there, explaining the costs and benefits of their bond-purchase tool, without communicating directly to the court.
Peter Huber, the judge who drafted the ruling, has kept up pressure on the ECB to respond, insisting that the institution isn’t a “master of the universe.” On Thursday, he argued that the central bank can’t start a “redistribution program.”
While the court set a deadline of early August for an explanation from the ECB of why the measure was proportionate, the window to act is much smaller because Germany’s Bundestag -- whose censure by judges makes it part of resolving the dispute -- is about to start its two-month summer recess.
The ECB’s legally mandated distance to national institutions is one aspect that has made the spat so complicated to address. In a bid to square that circle, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann told lawmakers last week that his central bank could effectively be a messenger for whatever Lagarde and the Governing Council express on the matter.
“We’re looking for an appropriate solution that allows the government and the Bundestag to have access to the considerations of the ECB’s Governing Council,” Weidmann told Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung in an interview.
The ECB is currently compiling records documenting the proportionality of bond purchases that the Bundesbank will pass on to Berlin, according to Boersen-Zeitung. Policy makers could sign off on that plan on Wednesday.
The stakes are high for the ECB, with Europe’s economy crawling out of an unprecedented slump and in need of prolonged monetary support.
”The term ‘proportionality’ will be a key component of the ECB’s vocabulary going forward, especially if legal challenges persist,” said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany. “It’s another question whether such an analysis can actually be conducted before measures are implemented. It’s in the nature of an unconventional measure that you can’t completely know how it works ahead of time.”
Lagarde will have a further opportunity to respond to the court when she answers a written query by a German member of the European Parliament who also asked about the proportionality of QE. Such correspondence from the EU’s legislature is often used as a method of holding the ECB accountable.
More legal trouble is looming, this time focused on the ECB’s newest stimulus tool, launched to help fight the coronavirus crisis, that will see it buy 1.35 trillion euros of debt by the middle of next year. The right-wing Alternative for Germany party has said it will sue the parliament and the federal government to stop the Bundesbank’s participation in that program too.
As if anticipating such problems, Lagarde -- a lawyer by training -- has already set out a defense. During a recent appearance at the European Parliament in Brussels, she argued the latest initiative also meets the court’s demand for proportionality.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank is expected to hold rates steady at its policy meeting on Wednesday, but strike a dovish tone as fears of a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic brings further economic uncertainty. 
All economists polled by Reuters expected the official cash rate (OCR) to remain unchanged at 0.25% for the rest of the year, and at least some of them see rates moving to zero and negative territory next year.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) said in May that the cash rate will remain at 0.25% until early 2021, but it was working with commercial banks to prepare for negative rates in the future.
New Zealand was among the first countries to declare it was free of COVID-19, and opened its economy faster than most others. But those gains were lost last week as new coronavirus cases emerged, and fears of a second wave of infections are growing. 
ANZ Bank said in a note that RBNZ would acknowledge activity bouncing back but also would point out that the country had not dodged a recession.
It would strike a balance between ""an encouraging tone while still sounding suitably dovish"" in order to keep the New Zealand dollar and monetary conditions low, Sharon Zollner said.
""The renewed strength in the NZD represents a meaningful
tightening in monetary conditions that will be decidedly unwelcome,"" she said.
The economy is in recession after GDP contracted 1.6% in the March quarter and expected to sink further in the next three-month period.
RBNZ would have to raise the NZ$60 billion ($38.5 billion) cap on its quantitative easing programme at some point, just to allow headroom for more stimulus to support the economy, Westpac said.

975,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2020 08:30PM ET</span>",U.S. housing set to ride out the pandemic's economic storm: Reuters poll,"By Hari Kishan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S. home prices will defy the current economic downturn and ride out the storm, supported by record low mortgage rates and limited supply, according to a Reuters poll that showed housing outpacing consumer price rises this year and next.
The U.S. housing market, which was at the epicenter of the previous financial crisis that led to a global recession, is expected to remain a bright spot amid a sharp downturn as the coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak economic havoc.
The pandemic has infected more than 2.2 million people in the United States, claiming around 120,000 lives and infections are rising in many parts of the country.
According to the June 9-19 poll of over 40 housing strategists, house prices will rise 3.0% this year and next.
Three months ago they were expected to rise 3.4% and 3.2% respectively, so the forecast is remarkably stable, given the economy is taking its worst hit on record and unemployment has soared to levels not seen since the Great Depression.
""Housing demand is coming back in dramatic fashion, with homebuilders in markets all around the country reporting a bounce-back in demand in May and June,"" said Brad Hunter, managing director at real estate advisory firm RCLCO. 
""Price reductions will be mostly confined to the lower tranches of the market."" 
These inflation-beating projections - the U.S. Federal Reserve's own median projections expect consumer inflation of 0.8% and 1.6% this year and next - come with mortgage rates at record lows and a persistent undersupply of homes.
Housing demand, highly sensitive to mortgage rates, has steadily declined since last November. But the average 30-year mortgage rate  hit a new low of 3.3% this month, providing an impetus for buyers to lock in cheap borrowing rates.
Tight inventories that have underpinned the housing recovery since 2012 are expected to be squeezed further after construction came to a standstill when much of the U.S. economy was closed for nearly two months to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. 
Over 60% of analysts, 21 of 34, said a return in U.S. housing market activity to pre-COVID levels would be gradual. Eight said the turnaround would be quick, two said it already had, and the remaining three said it would be slow and long.
Apart from weak activity, the main threat to the U.S. housing market is unemployment, which jumped from record lows to record highs within a couple of months. 
Nearly three-quarters of respondents, 25 of 34, said high unemployment, currently at 13.3%, was the biggest hurdle for the market over the coming year. Six cited a lack of supply of affordable homes, three picked stringent lending policies.
""The only factor supporting the housing market really will be very low mortgage rates. But again, I don't think that will more than compensate for elevated unemployment and relatively weak consumer confidence,"" said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
Still, only a few analysts were expecting house prices to fall in 2020, a stark difference from the 2008 crisis, when property values plummeted by more than a third.
""A disproportionate number of job losses were among the lower-paid sectors... (so) we should not see house prices fall as much as they did during the Great Recession,"" added Guatieri, implying that most of the unemployed were not existing homeowners or looking to buy a home before the pandemic hit.
""We do anticipate a much more moderate decline in house prices and that's simply because even though demand will remain relatively weak, supply has been weak as well,"" he said.

Even under a worst-case scenario, property prices were expected to drop only 1.2% this year and 1.0% in 2021.

The government will focus on infrastructure projects including high-speed railways and may approve a value-added tax cut to stem the coronavirus’s impact on the euro-zone’s third-biggest economy. Conte made his comments Sunday after eight days of closed-door talks with ministers and leaders from business, finance and labor at a Renaissance villa in Rome.
“We will probably need to intervene for a further widening of the budget gap because the resources are not enough to cope with the impact of a horrible year both economically and socially,” Conte told reporters. He said the government will present its reform plan in September.
Conte said his government is heading toward “a forced decision” in the next few days on whether to strip toll-road operator Autostrade per l’Italia SpA, which is controlled by the Benetton family’s Atlantia SpA, of licenses following a deadly 2018 bridge collapse.
“I don’t have an acceptable proposal on the table,” Conte said, adding he was ready to consider a new offer. “Atlantia has asked for a clear solution, and I think that we as a government have a duty to give a clear solution in the next days.”
The premier is drawing up a reform plan to lobby for Italy’s share of a proposed 750-billion euro ($838 billion) EU program to help member states recover from coronavirus lockdowns.
The virus recession is battering an Italian economy that was already shrinking at the end of last year. The Bank of Italy forecasts a contraction between 9.2% and 13.1% this year, and a more limited rebound in 2021. That is set to send debt well above 150% of GDP.
Conte, whose country stands to benefit the most from the proposed grants and loans, insisted at a videoconference of EU leaders on Friday that an accord must “absolutely” be reached by the end of July, according to an official familiar with his comments. He also called on leaders to “support the efforts of the Commission to make some resources available already for this year.”
Conte will likely seek parliament’s approval for about 10 billion euros in extra spending soon, government officials said Wednesday, in the latest step to revive one of Europe’s most vulnerable economies. The government has already approved two stimulus packages worth a total 75 billion euros.

978,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2020 03:01PM ET</span>",Changing of guard at top German court signals de-escalation for ECB,"By Madeline Chambers and Thomas Escritt
BERLIN (Reuters) - Changes to the composition of Germany's top court are likely to make it less confrontational towards the European Central Bank following a ruling about bond purchases that sent shockwaves around Europe, according to two sources close to the court.
In its ruling last month, the Constitutional Court gave the ECB three months to justify bond purchases under its flagship stimulus programme or lose the Bundesbank as a participant, raising questions about the future of the euro.
While Berlin is likely to have the final say on whether the ECB's justification is sufficient, the plaintiffs behind the case have signalled they could bring fresh legal action against new ECB stimulus plans, which could lead to more market turmoil.
However, there will be a changing of the guard at the German court in Karlsruhe on Monday.
A key change will be a new judge joining a bench widely seen to have a narrow Eurosceptic majority: Astrid Wallrabenstein, who was nominated by the pro-European Greens and has suggested there should be a thaw in relations with the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which cleared the ECB's plan.
She will take the place on the bench vacated by Andreas Vosskuhle, president of the court whose term has expired and is leaving. His role as president will go to Stephan Harbarth, a conservative lawmaker from 2009-2018. 
""She is a lot more Europe-friendly than Vosskuhle,"" said the first source, a constitutional law professor who is well connected at the court and knows Wallrabenstein. ""So my forecast is that in future, such decisions like that on the ECB will no longer be taken.""
Wallrabenstein's appointment could help pave the way towards a more conciliatory tone from the court, which experts say has a history of provoking crises before softening its stance.
""Typically what happens is the court does something that make people think it's overreached and then they back off a bit,"" said Justin Collings, historian of the German constitutional court at Brigham Young University in Utah.
A spokesman for the court said he could not speculate on the direction of forthcoming decisions from the court in view of the personnel changes and each decision was taken on its own merit and by a group of eight judges in confidence.
'MORE THAN A MATCH'
The constitutional court is divided into two senates, each with eight judges, which handle different cases. Wallrabenstein will join the second senate, which made the May 5 ruling on the ECB's bond purchases.
Although the second senate voted 7-1 to pass the ruling, they aim for consensus. The arrival of Wallrabenstein promises to shift the balance, at least over time, said the second source, who is close to the court, noting that she is the first judge on the second senate to be nominated by the Greens.
""Every new justice changes something. In a group of eight people, one new person will make a difference,"" said the source. ""There may well be more vigorous discussions.""
The law professor who knows the Karlsruhe judges said the dynamic on the second senate ""has been strongly shaped by the interplay of Vosskuhle and (Peter) Huber"", a conservative who described the May 5 ruling as ""imperative"".
Of Wallrabenstein, the professor added: ""She won't go looking for open conflict, but she has good arguments and is more than a match for Huber.""
Wallrabenstein has shown she is prepared to take a stand.
In 2014, as a lawyer, she represented a - failed - case at the Karlsruhe court to have former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden heard by an investigating committee in Berlin.
She has already suggested a softer approach in relations with the ECJ, which cleared the ECB's stimulus plan in 2018. The Karlsruhe judges decided they were not bound by that ruling, saying the European court had failed to scrutinise the ECB's actions to the point of making its own verdict ""meaningless"".
""The tone has become harsher lately,"" Wallrabenstein said late last month of relations between the courts. ""Just carrying on like this perhaps becomes a bit difficult now.""
Contacted by Reuters at the weekend, Wallrabenstein declined to comment further.
However, she was quoted by Germany's Frankfurter Sonntagszeitung weekly as saying she hoped that ""things would move in the right direction"", adding it was now about how to carry on after an argument and say: ""Forget it, let's move on"".
CONUNDRUM FOR BERLIN
The German court has said its May ruling did not apply to new ECB measures, leaving room for a fresh challenge.
However, while the plaintiffs behind the original case have signalled they could bring new legal action, the second source told Reuters that the Karlsruhe court felt it had made its point with the May 5 ruling. 
Nonetheless, the May 5 decision still poses a conundrum for Berlin, which is bound to respect the Karlsruhe court, but at the same time, does not want to erode the independence of the ECB, whose unprecedented stimulus has kept the euro zone intact.
ECB watchers see two potential exit routes: either the Bundesbank or the European Parliament, which has the right to question the ECB, seeks a clarification about the bond purchases from the euro zone central bank. 

Berlin must then either accept or reject the justification. Rejection would require the Bundesbank to pull out of the scheme, and put a question mark over Germany's role in the euro.

""A further increase in the budget deficit is likely,"" Conte told a press conference.

The government was working instead to reduce the gap between a worker's gross and net salary, commonly known as the ""tax wedge"", he said.

980,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2020 10:20AM ET</span>","As Bank of Canada quells sub-zero rates talk, next move may be a hike in 2022","By Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - Investors, looking past the COVID-19 pandemic, are betting that the Bank of Canada could be among the first major central banks to hike interest rates, signaling new governor Tiff Macklem's success so far convincing the market not to expect negative rates.
Money market data shows investors have moved away from pricing in additional easing by the Bank of Canada and instead see a steady profile for rates this year and next, with about a 50% chance of a rate hike in 2022. .
The Federal Reserve, which has been pressured by U.S. President Donald Trump to cut rates below zero, is not expected by money markets to hike until at least 2023.
""The Bank of Canada has done a better job than some other central banks of quashing speculation around further rate cuts,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities.
""If you think that the economy did hit bottom in April, a rate hike in two years ... is a plausible outcome I think,"" Kelvin said.
After the Bank of Canada slashed interest rates in March to a record low of 0.25%, speculation mounted that it would join central banks in Japan and Europe in setting rates below zero.
Just last month, the Canadian dollar slumped as some investors mistook a comment by Macklem, on the day he was named the governor, as putting negative rates on the table.
Sub-zero rates lower borrowing costs and could help exporters if the Canadian dollar were to decline, but they also hurt lending margins for banks and penalize savers.
Some economists argue the experience of Europe and Japan shows that negative rates are not effective at boosting economic growth. Alternatives for the Bank of Canada if it needs to add stimulus include adding to the size of its bond-buying program.
Both Macklem and his predecessor Stephen Poloz have said they see 0.25% as the floor for rates. That could have headed off some potential headaches.
If negative rates ""were to get priced in and the BoC didn't meet the market expectation, then the BoC would be disappointing markets,"" said Greg Anderson, global head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets. It ""would likely trigger an equity decline and CAD rally at a really bad moment.""
Money markets could also be signaling confidence that adequate fiscal and monetary policy stimulus has been put in place to help Canada's economy recover, said TD's Kelvin, adding that the BoC will not want to encourage excessive borrowing from already heavily-indebted Canadians.

""I wouldn't be surprised if the Bank of Canada was a little bit more eager (than other central banks) to move out of emergency rates when they are able to,"" Kelvin said.

Investing.com - The main economic indicator in focus for investors this week will be the rising U.S. coronavirus case count, while the International Monetary Fund is set to slash its global growth forecasts. It’s going to be a quiet week on the economic calendar, with updates on the housing sector, durable goods orders, and of course weekly jobless claims in the U.S. In the euro zone and UK PMI’s are likely to remain in deep contractionary territory. Meanwhile the FTSE Russell is set to reconstitute its stock indexes on Friday, an annual event that historically creates one of the biggest trading volume days of the year. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
Spikes in coronavirus infection rates in several U.S. states, mainly in the South and West look set to add to market jitters over a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said he had asked U.S. officials to slow down testing, calling it a ""double-edged sword"" that led to more cases being discovered.
Health experts say expanded diagnostic testing accounts for some, but not all, of the growth in cases. Over 119,600 Americans have died from the virus to date, according to Reuters’ data.
On Friday, Federal Reserve officials warned that the lack of containment could lead to a need for more prolonged shut-downs and added that the recent positive trend on job gains could soon be reversed.
In its updated global economic forecast due out on Wednesday the IMF is expected to say the 2020 global recession will be even worse than it estimated in its previous forecast in April.
Back then the IMF said the global economy would suffer the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s as it forecast a contraction of 3%. Now the fund is due to warn that the decline could be even worse.
“For the first time since the Great Depression, both advanced and emerging market economies will be in recession in 2020. The forthcoming June World Economic Outlook Update is likely to show negative growth rates even worse than previously estimated,” Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s chief economist, said in a blog post last Tuesday.
Gopinath also said the current crisis is “unlike anything the world has seen before.”
It’s set to be a quiet week on the U.S. economic calendar with investors focusing on new and existing home sales for May along with durable goods orders which are expected to rebound but remain below pre-virus levels.
Thursday’s closely watched report on initial jobless claims will be the main event, as it provides the timeliest data on the economy’s health.
Last Thursday’s report showed that while the number of initial jobless claims fell the pace of the decline stalled, underlining the view that the economy faces a long and difficult recovery from the COVID-19 recession.
The U.S. is also set to release its third estimate on first quarter GDP on Thursday, which will be largely of historical interest.
In the euro zone, a report on consumer confidence on Monday will provide a snapshot of how quickly sentiment is recovering as economies gradually reopen. Tuesday’s PMI data for June will also be closely watched. PMI data for May, while better than April showed that the manufacturing and service sectors were still deep in contraction territory.
The UK is also to release PMI data this week and while a sizable rebound is forecast in both the manufacturing and service sectors both readings are expected to remain well below the key 50 level which separates growth from contraction.
The FTSE Russell reshuffles its stock indexes late Friday. The annual rebalancing becomes final on the fourth Friday every June, after markets close.
The resulting surge in trading volume crests right before the market close. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, because of the scale of the revamp, reinforces the rules for trades on the close and contingency plans in the event of unusual market conditions.
Stocks are added or deleted from Russell's family of indexes, including the Russell 1000 large cap and Russell 2000 small cap, prompting fund managers to adjust portfolios to reflect new weightings and components.
Bank of America analysts predict big changes this year, with a greater skew towards mega-cap tech stocks. Those ""moving up"" may include names such as  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:ZM), Slack (NYSE:WORK) and Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) which have risen in price amid the shift to remote working.

982,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2020 05:15AM ET</span>","Inflation dog may finally bark, investors bet","By Yoruk Bahceli
LONDON (Reuters) - Gold, forests, property stocks, inflation-linked bonds - these are just some of the assets investors are pouring money into on the view that the recent explosion of government spending and central bank stimulus may finally rouse inflation from its decade-long slumber.
With the world economy forecast to shrink 6% this year, it may seem like a strange time to fret about inflation.
And sure enough, market-based gauges suggest an uptrend in prices may not trouble investors for years. U.S. and euro zone inflation gauges indicate that annual price growth will be running at barely over 1% even a decade from now.  . 
So if inflation really is, as the IMF put it in 2013, ""the dog that didn't bark"", failing to respond to all the central bank money-printing unleashed in the wake of the 2008-9 crisis, why should investors prepare for it now, especially as demographics and technology are also conspiring to tamp down inflation across the developed world?
The answer is that some think the dog really will bark this time, partly because - unlike in the post-2008 years - governments around the world have also been rolling out massive spending packages, in a bid to limit the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
""We will be pushing, pushing, pushing on the string and dropping our guard, then 3-5 years from now...that's when the (inflation) dog will start barking,"" said PineBridge Investments' head of multi-asset Mike Kelly, who has been buying gold on that view.
""Gold worries about such things long in advance. It has risen through this coronavirus with that down-the-road-risk top of mind,"" he added.
Even typically frugal governments such as Germany have joined central banks with trillions of dollars in stimulus programmes. Investors say even the long taboo topic of debt monetisation, where central banks directly fund government spending, may be on the cards.
""What worries me is that at the moment it seems that there is no limit to fiscal stimulus,"" said Klaus Kaldemorgen, a portfolio manager at asset manager DWS, who said he was investing in inflation hedges far more now than he was after 2008.
Inflation hawks also cite a trend of de-globalisation, where shrinking international trade and Western companies bringing production back to their own countries leads to higher prices.
This view that inflation could pick up ahead is reflected in forward swaps and in Citi's inflation surprise indexes, which show that the extent that U.S. inflation readings are surprising against market expectations has been at a record high and has ticked higher in the euro zone, too.
(GRAPHIC: Citi inflation surprise indexes - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmypmodylpr/citi.PNG)
WHAT TO BUY? 
Investors have an interest in pricing future inflation correctly to safeguard their returns, hence the need for hedges, assets that increase in value or at least hold it when price growth accelerates.
They appear primarily to favor U.S. inflation-linked bonds and gold. Wealth managers canvassed by Reuters have been channelling up to 10% of clients' portfolios into the yellow metal via index funds, gold shares and even bullion.
But if gold prices have risen 18% since the end of March , some other hedges remain cheap. 
U.S. 10-year inflation-linked bonds - known as TIPS - show ""break-evens"", or the anticipated rate of inflation in a decade, around just 1.2%. 
Also known as linkers, the face value and interest payments on these securities rise with inflation. 
But despite the stimulus boom, ""the inflation levels that are priced in are much lower than what was priced in at the end of last year,"" said Teun Draaisma, a portfolio manager at Man Group, who has invested in inflation-linked assets.
(GRAPHIC: US TIPS breakeven rates - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdpzwrnovw/linkers.PNG)
So inflation might be some years away, but banks are advising clients to pick up cheap hedges.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) suggests U.S. 30-year linkers, while Natwest advises buying 30-year UK linkers and 10-year euro zone inflation swaps. 
""These hedges in many cases look extraordinarily cheap, so why not buy them now? We could wait, then things could start to move away from us,"" said Colin Harte, multi-asset portfolio manager at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management.
Indeed, the S&P 10-year U.S. TIPS Index is already up 12% from March levels <.SPBDU1ST>. 
""It won't be a couple of years from now until (inflationary factors) start to come through, so that's why we keep (long-dated U.S. linkers),"" said Chris Jeffery at Legal & General's asset allocation team. 
Harte at BNP said his main hedge is gold but he has also invested in a broader commodity basket which includes natural gas, copper and oil. 
WOOD AND FORESTS
And it's not just about gold or linkers: another choice is real estate. Kaldemorgen of DWS is buying German residential property stocks, betting that the supply of new property will rise slower than the money supply.
Global house prices, adjusted for inflation, rose 14% in 2009-2019, according to the IMF.
Legal & General's Jeffery accelerated investments in agricultural land and forestry earlier this year in expectation they will retain their real value over the five- to 10-year horizon. His holdings are via publicly listed shares of companies heavily exposed to such land.
Timber prices rose over 130% in real terms in Great Britain over the past decade, Forest Research data shows, while the value of U.S. farmland rose 28% in the decade to 2019, according to the Department of Agriculture. 

Kelly of PineBridge also favours timberland, purchased through private funds. While predicting that linkers will remain cheap for the next few years, he expects timber to benefit sooner if rock-bottom mortgages entice more first-time home buyers and fuel a construction boom.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) has secured clearance to deliver alcohol in India's eastern state of West Bengal, according to a document seen by Reuters, signalling the U.S. e-commerce giant's first foray into the country's multi-billion-dollar sector. 
In a notice on Friday, West Bengal State Beverages Corp, the authorised agency to carry out online retail of liquor trade in the state, said Amazon was among the companies found to be eligible for registration with authorities.
Alibaba-backed (N:BABA) Indian grocery venture BigBasket has also won approval to deliver alcohol in the state, the notice said. 
West Bengal is India's fourth most populous state, with a population of more than 90 million people.
Amazon has been invited to sign a memorandum of understanding with the state, said the notice, which has not previously been reported.
Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. BigBasket also did not respond to a request for comment.
Amazon's interest in delivering alcohol in West Bengal marks a bold move to make inroads into a market that is worth $27.2 billion, according to estimates by IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.
Over the years, Amazon has expanded its e-commere operations in India as more and more people go online to shop for everything from groceries to electronics. The company has committed $6.5 billion in investments in India, one of its key growth markets.
India's top two food-delivery startups, Swiggy and Zomato, started delivering alcohol in some cities last month, as they looked to cash in on the high demand for booze as many states come out of a lockdown aimed at tackling the coronavirus.
India restricted liquor sales when it announced a nationwide lockdown in March. Hundreds of people queued up at liquor stores in May when some restrictions were eased, and the liquor industry had been lobbying with many states to allow online deliveries.
Each state sets its own alcohol sales policy. West Bengal last month invited companies to express interest for ""handling electronic ordering, purchase, sale and home delivery of alcoholic liquors from licensed retail outlets"" to eligible legal-age consumers in the state.

987,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 04:45PM ET</span>",Fed officials signal rising caution on U.S. economic recovery amid virus spread,"By Jonnelle Marte and Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Dunsmuir
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. Federal Reserve officials sounded increasing pessimism on Friday on the swiftness of any economic recovery from the novel coronavirus epidemic and warned the unemployment rate could rise again if the disease is not brought under control.
The central bank already made clear it expects a full economic healing from the impact of the virus to take years as it kept interest rate near zero at its policy meeting last week.
But nascent signs of recovery in U.S. economic data, with better-than-expected job gains and retail sales for the month of May, had fueled some hopes that the United States could bounce back more quickly.
Fed officials pushed back on that view on Friday and cautioned against reopening the economy too hastily after the end of state lockdowns aimed at containing the virus, which has killed more than 118,000 Americans.
California, North Carolina and a string of U.S. cities mandated or urged mandatory use of masks on Thursday to get a grip on spiraling coronavirus cases as at least six states set daily records.
""This lack of containment could ultimately lead to a need for more prolonged shut-downs, which result in reduced consumption and investment, and higher unemployment,"" Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said in a virtual event organized by the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce. 
Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari also said the economic recovery would take longer than he had hoped just a few months ago, and warned the recent positive trend on job gains could soon be reversed if the virus is not tamed soon.
""Unfortunately, my base case scenario is that we will see a second wave of the virus across the U.S., probably this fall,"" Kashkari said during a Twitter chat moderated by CBS News. ""If there is a second wave, I would expect the unemployment rate to climb again.""
LONG AND SLOW 
Earlier this week, in two separate appearances before lawmakers in the U.S. Congress, Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned millions of people will likely still be unemployed even as the economy is on the path of recovery.
Powell, Rosengren and others have all said more fiscal and monetary policy support is likely needed to help them. Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida told Fox Business Network on Friday ""there's more that we can do, I think there's more that we will do.""
Clarida added there is no limit to the Fed's potential purchases of Treasury securities or mortgage-backed securities.
Congress has allocated nearly $3 trillion for coronavirus-related economic aid and the Fed has pumped trillions of dollars of credit into the economy to cushion it from the fallout from the epidemic.
But some Republicans have been resistant to doing more quickly, especially given recent positive economic data.
Powell, in a separate appearance on Friday, reiterated that the U.S. economic recovery will not be quick or smooth.
""We will make our way back from this, but it will take time and work ... The path ahead is likely to be challenging,"" Powell said during a webcast discussion with local business and community leaders in Youngstown, Ohio, on building a resilient workforce.
""Lives and livelihoods have been lost, and uncertainty looms large,"" he said.

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is far from meeting its dual mandate of targeting inflation and maximum employment and there is more the central bank can do to support the U.S. economy, Fed vice chair Richard Clarida said on Friday. 
""We've taken very aggressive, proactive actions,"" Clarida said during an interview with Fox Business. ""There's more that we can do, I think there's more that we will do."" 
Clarida said there is no limit to the Fed's potential purchases of Treasury securities or mortgage-backed securities, and he reiterated the view shared by other Fed officials that negative interest rates would not be appropriate for the U.S. Despite low inflation, officials are not thinking about lowering the Fed's 2% target, Clarida said. 
When asked about the Fed's purchases of corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds that invest in corporate bonds, Clarida said the goal of the purchases is to ""support good market functioning."" 
Earlier this week, the Fed started purchasing individual corporate bonds through the secondary market corporate credit facility, using an index that provides broad market exposure, focused mostly on high quality companies. Previously, it required companies to apply for direct bond purchases.
Clarida said he did not think the purchases were fueling new bubbles but that the Fed would stay attuned for potential risks. ""When the economy has recovered and is back on its feet we will be willing to pull back from these programs, but that's down the road,"" he said.

“We’ve taken very aggressive, proactive action,” Clarida told the Fox Business Network in an interview on Friday. “There’s more that we can do and we will.”
Clarida said the amount of credit the Fed can provide through the nine emergency programs it has unveiled to shore up the economy is limited only by the taxpayer backstops extended to each facility by the U.S. Treasury Department to protect against losses.
“For the foreseeable future I don’t see a limit as being a practical consideration,” he said.
Zero Rates
Fed officials last week held interest rates near zero and signaled they would keep them there through 2022 to help households and businesses make it through the period of shutdowns triggered by the virus. They’ve also said that more stimulus may be needed from both monetary and fiscal authorities.
Chair Jerome Powell urged Congress on Wednesday not to pull back too quickly on federal relief for households and small businesses.
Lawmakers are debating whether to renew the fiscal-aid measures they’ve approved for the millions of Americans who lost their jobs in recent months as businesses closed to stem the spread of the virus. The expanded unemployment insurance payments of $600 a week that formed part of the relief package are set to expire on July 31.
So far, Congress has authorized about $3 trillion of aid. The White House and Democrat lawmakers are pushing for another package, while many Republicans maintain Congress should wait and assess the economic impact of the measures that have already been put in place.
Clarida, as he and other Fed officials have done repeatedly in recent week, ruled out the idea the central bank may push its benchmark interest rate into negative territory.

LONDON (Reuters) - British security officials have told UK telecom operators to ensure they have adequate stockpiles of Huawei equipment due to fears that new U.S. sanctions will disrupt the Chinese firm's ability to maintain critical supplies, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Britain granted Huawei a limited role in its future 5G networks in January, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has since come under renewed pressure from Washington and some lawmakers in his own party who say the company's equipment is a security risk. Huawei has repeatedly denied the allegations.
Officials at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) are now studying the impact of U.S. measures announced in May, which are intended to restrict Huawei's ability to source the advanced microchips needed to produce its 5G equipment and flagship smartphones. 
Senior NCSC officials wrote to operators including Britain's BT Group (LON:BT) and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) last week, said three people familiar with the matter, telling them to maintain adequate supplies of spare parts from all manufacturers.
But the letter also emphasised the increased risk to Huawei's equipment and its future ability to provide updates for those products in the face of U.S. pressure.
""Ensuring that products and components are kept up-to-date is essential to maintaining the security of networks,"" the letter said. ""Escalating U.S. action against Huawei may affect its ability to provide updates for products containing U.S. technology.""
An NCSC spokeswoman said: ""The NCSC has provided operators with a series of precautionary steps we recommend they take while we carefully consider the impact these sanctions have on the UK's networks.""
Huawei Vice President Victor Zhang said: ""Our customers are our number one priority and we are working with them to ensure business continuity. We strongly oppose politically-motivated actions by the US that are designed to damage our business and are not based on evidence.""
BT and Vodafone declined to comment. 
Britain designated Huawei a ""high-risk vendor"" in January, capping its 5G involvement at a 35% market share and excluding it from the data-heavy core of the network. 
Officials now say they are reviewing the specific guidance on how Huawei equipment should be deployed in order to best secure UK networks and are considering a range of options. A decision is due in the coming weeks.

Any move by London to further restrict Huawei or bar the company completely would strain relations with China, which have grown tense in recent months over Beijing's handling of the situation in Hong Kong and the COVID-19 pandemic.

(Reuters) - The economic recovery from the crisis spurred by the novel coronavirus could proceed more slowly than policymakers initially anticipated, potentially including a second wave of infections in the fall and another increase in the unemployment rate, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said on Friday. 
""The recovery will take longer than we had hoped only a few months ago,"" Kashkari said during a Twitter chat moderated by CBS News. ""Many jobs are going to take a long time to come back.""
The federal government needs to keep supporting Americans who lost their jobs because of the coronavirus crisis and may not get back to work for a while, he said. 
Unemployment benefits can help get money to jobless people who need help paying their bills, and capping those benefits at workers' previous pay could ""eliminate the disincentive to return to work,"" he said. 
Kashkari also cautioned that banks could take a hit if the downturn is prolonged. “I am concerned the longer this goes on, the more losses banks will face,” he said. 

Large banks have more capital than they did before the 2008 financial crisis, but it may not be enough, he said, calling on banks to stop paying dividends and raise capital.

The savings under the COVID-19-linked Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) will be short-term, since the initiative only provides for suspension of debt payments through the end of the year. It postpones those payments until a later date but does not cancel them outright.
The second-largest saver among eligible DSSI countries would be Pakistan, with $2.4 billion, followed by Kenya with $802 million, according to the data https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/debt/brief/covid-19-debt-service-suspension-initiative.
In terms of savings compared with gross domestic product, Bhutan would reap the most benefits from the plan with 7.3% of GDP savings, followed by Angola at 3.7% and Djibouti at 2.5%.
Besides each country's estimated savings, the database includes details on debt owed to multilaterals like the International Monetary Fund as well as on official and non-official bilateral debt disbursed and debt service due per year.
IMF and World Bank officials have warned that the COVID-19 pandemic will hit developing and emerging markets particularly hard given high levels of debt, sharp drops in oil and other commodity prices and insufficient healthcare systems.
The DSSI is backed by the G-20, the World Bank, the IMF and the Paris Club of sovereign lenders. The database provides a new level of transparency about debts and creditors, including China, which has become one of the largest creditors in Africa and elsewhere over the past two decades.
The Jubilee Debt campaign has estimated the cancellation of poor countries’ debt payments, including to private creditors, would free over $25 billion for the countries this year, or $50 billion if extended through 2021.
The United Nations, many African countries and civil society groups have called for the debt relief to be extended for two years to allow countries to recover more fully from the economic shock of the pandemic.

“If there is a second wave, I would expect the unemployment rate to climb again. I think the real number today is around 20%,” he added in a follow-up tweet.
The official unemployment rate fell to 13.3% in May after the fallout from the pandemic sent it surging to 14.7% in April. According to projections published on June 10, Fed officials saw unemployment ending the year somewhere between 7% and 14%.

BUENOS AIRES/LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Argentina's debt deal was hanging in the balance on Friday, with creditors and the government at an impasse, though most analysts expected the two sides to find a way to bridge the divide after having made significant progress over the last month.
The South American grains producer, long a boom-and-bust economy that in May defaulted for a ninth time, has twice improved a proposal to restructure around $65 billion in foreign debt, though talks with creditors hit a roadblock this week.
Creditor groups are demanding Argentina improve its offer further, while the government stance is that it cannot cede ground after raising its offer to around 50 cents on the dollar, plus an additional export-linked sweetener.
With a fluid deadline on Friday for a deal, expected to be extended, analysts said that despite the tensions, the two sides should be able to reach a deal.
""While it would have been better that negotiations continued with more constructive statements, this is not the first time the restructuring would seem to be at an impasse,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.
It said that at a 10% exit yield, the government's offer was worth around 49.7 cents, while the most aggressive counter from two groups, including names like BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Fidelity and AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB), was worth around 57 cents.
""At less than 8 points difference, it would not benefit either side to completely break away from negotiations,"" the investment bank said, adding it stuck by its view that a deal would be reached in the third quarter of the year.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said while risks had risen, the two sides may ultimately find a way to bridge a gap it calculated at 5 cents and ""avoid a disorderly and contentious default.""
The country's over-the-counter bonds rose on average 0.9% on Friday after losing ground a day earlier.
BURNED BRIDGES?
Argentina's government has to decide whether to extend the previously delayed Friday deadline while it faces bond repayments at the end of the month that have a 30-day grace period. It defaulted on three interest payments in May.
""The negotiations with creditors are progressing and we are confident of finding a point of agreement,"" center-left Peronist President Alberto Fernandez, who took office last December, said in a radio broadcast on Friday.
Siobhan Morden at Amherst Pierpont said in a note the options appeared to be returning to talks or using coercive tactics to force a resolution, though she added that ""both sides lose from a protracted impasse or unresolved debt crisis.""
""We have been saying that the final phase is the most difficult, but it still seems illogical that a solution cannot be reached when both sides are so close,"" she added.
Some were more negative, however.
Kim Catechis, investment strategy head at Martin Currie, said Argentina risked burning bridges with investors and cautioned about the rising prominence of populist Vice President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.
A bondholder with knowledge of the negotiations said the two sides seemed to be skirting around a deal.
""It's like we're sort of dancing around it. It's a game, they are treating this like a continuation of a poker game that they want to keep playing,"" he said.
Roger Horn, senior emerging market strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities America in New York, said that given the tough current context, the progress already made was notable.

""When you think about it, getting a recovery of almost 50 cents on the dollar from a serial defaulter with the Peronists in power, Cristina in the background, with a collapsed economy during a pandemic, doesn't sound so bad,"" he said.

“While we are all affected, the burden has fallen disproportionately on those least able to bear it,” Powell said Friday via video conference, where he also paid tribute to the day marking the end of American slavery. “A particular cruelty of the pandemic has been its disproportionate effects on many areas that were already suffering.”
Powell and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester were taking part in a virtual conference about building a resilient workforce in the era of Covid-19 focused on Youngstown, Ohio, a year after the closure of the Lordstown General Motors (NYSE:GM) plant.
Juneteenth
“It is not lost on me that we are meeting on Juneteenth amid a renewed reckoning of racial injustice,” Powell said. “The pandemic has again exposed a range of troubling inequalities, most of them of long standing. As the national discussion continues, it is critical to remember that equity includes access to education, work, and economic opportunity.”
The spread of the virus has caused “immense hardship and suffering,” Powell said. “We will make our way back from this, but it will take time and work.”
The Fed leader said the goals of economic and racial progress are intertwined, citing Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have A Dream” speech given not far from the central bank headquarters.
Stark Realities
Noting that prior to the pandemic, the U.S. was experiencing the longest expansion on record with unemployment at the lowest level in 50 years, Powell said this bright picture painted over some glaring cracks.
“That economic good fortune had eluded pockets across the country, including Youngstown.”
Powell said his goal is to return the U.S. economy to a state similar to prior to the pandemic. In congressional testimony this week, he emphasized the Fed wants to restore a tighter labor market that creates more opportunities and lifts wages for lower-income workers.
“The path ahead is likely to be challenging,” Powell said. “But given the opportunity, I’ll always bet on the American people and on the kind of community resolve and dedication we’re hearing about today.”

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Quebec, the Canadian province hardest-hit by COVID-19, will post a record C$14.9 billion ($11 billion) deficit for the fiscal year ending in March, as it spent heavily to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, and expects a return to a normal level of economic activity in December 2021.
Quebec spent more than C$6.6 billion on financial support to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus and expects fiscal 2020-2021 revenue to decline by C$8.5 billion, a 9% drop in government's own-source revenues, Finance Minister Eric Girard said on Friday.
The province has budgeted C$4 billion for mitigation of risks from a second wave of coronavirus outbreak in the fall, a number that has been included in the deficit forecast.
Quebec says it hopes to return to December 2019 production levels by the same month in 2021 and aims to return to fiscal balance within five years. 
The province accounts for roughly a quarter of Canada’s population but has reported nearly 55% of the nation’s 100,200 coronavirus cases and almost two-thirds of its 8,300 deaths.
Quebec's real GDP is projected to contract by 6.5% in calendar 2020, compared with the 2% growth expected in the March budget.
Shelter-in-place directives halted 40% of economic activity in the province for eight weeks, Girard said. 
But some 230,000 jobs were gained since the reopening of economic sectors like construction and mining in May, bringing the unemployment rate to 13.7%.
""Conditions should improve by the end of the year, but not all the jobs will come back,"" Girard told reporters in Quebec City.
Coronavirus has weighed on Canada’s second most populous province, which had been using budget surpluses driven by a strong economy to pay down debt.

Quebec is also forecasting gross-debt-to-GDP ratio at 50.4% in March 2021, compared with 43.4% in 2020.

The exams help the Fed set the most important capital demands imposed on the largest U.S. lenders -- and they are instrumental for banks in setting shareholder dividends. While the tests have produced fewer shocks in recent years than in the period when they were initiated after the 2008 financial meltdown, next week’s results could see drama as the first to be calculated while a real crisis is raging.
“We simply would not have been doing our jobs if we had just run the test using a scenario framed before the economy began to deteriorate in March,” Quarles said in remarks set to be delivered Friday in an online event hosted by Women in Housing & Finance.
Though the Fed didn’t have time or data to run a “complete and updated” Covid-19 stress test, Quarles said, it did amplify some key parts of the existing scenarios.
“This sensitivity analysis has helped sharpen our understanding of how banks may fare in the wide range of possible outcomes,” Quarles said in his prepared remarks.
While the banks’ main capital targets will be set in the normal way, according to existing rules, he said, the separate pandemic analysis has been conducted by Fed staff to get a sense of how lenders may be weathering the pandemic depending on a few different potential paths for the current recession.
“We will use the results of our sensitivity analysis to inform our overall stance on capital distributions and in ongoing bank supervision,” he said.
The banks will be directed to look at their individual results and come up with announcements on their capital plans -- including dividends -- by the end of the day on June 29, according to a footnote in Quarles’ speech.

(Reuters) - The continued spread of the novel coronavirus could hamper the U.S. economic rebound from the pandemic, and more fiscal and monetary support will likely be needed, Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren said on Friday. 
Rosengren repeated his view that the U.S. unemployment rate will likely be ""at double-digit levels"" at the end of 2020 and cautioned against reopening the economy too quickly after the end of lockdowns aimed at containing the virus. 
""This lack of containment could ultimately lead to a need for more prolonged shut-downs, which result in reduced consumption and investment, and higher unemployment,"" Rosengren said in a virtual event organized by the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce. 
The U.S. central bank moved quickly to support the economy by cutting interest rates to near zero and rolling out a slew of emergency lending facilities. In his remarks on Friday, Rosengren said those moves likely were not enough and that more support is needed from both monetary and fiscal policy.
The Fed's Main Street Lending Program, which targets small and medium-sized businesses, was officially launched this week after nearly three months of planning. Some small lenders and small business consultants said the program may not be a good fit for many struggling businesses.
But Rosengren said recent changes the Fed made to expand the program should make it attractive to more borrowers. He also encouraged more lenders to register, adding they might need it in the fall if there is a resurgence of the virus. 
""These are still early days in the program, and we are seeing a steady stream of interest,"" Rosengren said.
Rosengren also said the commercial real estate sector will face challenges in the wake of the pandemic, with some companies needing more space and others asking more employees to work from home. 

""It's too soon to know how it’s going to affect all elements of real estate,"" he said.

“More support is likely to be needed from both monetary and fiscal policy,” Rosengren said in the text of a speech he’s scheduled to deliver online Friday to the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce. He sees unemployment remaining above 10% through the end of this year, with inflation persisting “well below” the Fed’s 2% target.
“Unemployment remains very high, and because of the continued community spread of the disease and the acceleration of new cases in many states, I expect the economic rebound in the second half of the year to be less than was hoped for at the outset of the pandemic,” he said.
Pessimistic Outlook
Rosengren’s outlook put him on the pessimistic side of projections released June 10 by the Federal Open Market Committee. The median forecast for unemployment at the end of 2020 among the 17 policy makers was 9.3%.
But Rosengren is not alone in warning that recent strong economic indicators -- like the May jobs report and retail sales data -- may be misleading. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, appearing before lawmakers this week, said he expects a significant bounceback in the labor market in the near term, but one that leaves the U.S. far short of employment levels seen before the pandemic.
Rosengren focused some of his remarks on re-opening efforts in some states, like South Carolina and Florida, where there is evidence that new cases are rising.
Risky Reopening
“Given the death toll of the virus even with the economic lockdown, I see a substantial risk in reopening too fast and relaxing social distancing too much,” he said.
He also made clear the threat is not just to public health, but also to the economy.
“So far, in the United States efforts to contain the virus have not been particularly successful,” he said. “This lack of containment could ultimately lead to a need for more prolonged shut-downs, which result in reduced consumption and investment, and higher unemployment.”
Main Street
Rosengren also commented on the Main Street Lending Program, an emergency credit facility created by the central bank and administered by the Boston Fed. It aims to provide loans to small and mid-size businesses and was opened for lender-registration on Monday.
He said more than 200 financial institutions of various size from across the country had begun registering to participate, and that interest from businesses was “tremendous.”
The program, in which banks will make loans of $250,000 to $300 million and then sell a 95% stake in each loan to the Fed, has been slow to start since its March announcement and has been modified several times. The Fed received thousands of comment letters in response to the initial announcement of the program, and some critics argue the terms and complexity of the program may still not be favorable to borrowers or lenders.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's central bank is expected to trim its policy rate by 25 basis points to 8%, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, a relatively limited cut in an aggressive easing cycle that has lasted nearly a year.
The bank has slashed its key interest rate by 1,575 basis points since July last year, when it stood at 24%. The stimulus was at first meant to pull the economy out of a recession last year, and is now blunting fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
In the Reuters poll of 16 economists, the median estimate was for a cut to 8%. Estimates ranged from no change in the policy rate at 8.25%, to a 50-point cut to 7.75%.
Since the outbreak hit Turkey, the central bank has slashed rates by 250 basis points, bought record amounts of government bonds and provided some funding below the policy rate.
Enver Erkan, economist at Tera Yatirim, said the policy flexibility had narrowed after the year-long monetary easing. 
""Interest rates are below inflation and we have gotten close to the central bank's year-end inflation estimate,"" he said, adding that the bank would likely stick to small cuts or stand pat in coming months.
With the outbreak hammering domestic demand, tourism and exports, the bank last month lowered its inflation forecast for end-2020 to 7.4%.
Plummeting global oil prices have pushed inflation down in import-dependent Turkey, while on the other hand a depreciation in the lira raises import prices. Turkey's currency hit an all-time low of 7.2690 versus the dollar in May before rallying. 
The median estimate of 11 economists for the policy rate at year-end stood at 7.75%, down from 8% last month, with forecasts ranging between 8% and 7.25%. 

The bank will announce its rate decision on June 25 at 1100 GMT.

In the transaction on Thursday, Turkish companies in various sectors paid, via banks, their import bills from China using yuan, the central bank said.
It added that the move would strengthen cooperation between Turkey and China, and that commercial banks would be able to add products related to trade and financial activities with a strategy based on the swap agreement.
A fall in the Turkish central bank's foreign exchange reserves, partly caused by state bank interventions to prop up the lira, has raised concerns that Turkey would need foreign funding.
Reuters reported in May that the central bank was making efforts to establish swap lines with the central banks of England and Japan and expand its existing swap lines with Qatar and China.

The tripling of the swap line with Qatar to $15 billion equivalent in local currencies last month led to an $8 billion rise in the reserves, but analysts said it was far from meeting the country's needs.

""This is not the moment to draw red lines, it is the moment to open green pathways to a deal in July,"" Costa told a news conference after a videoconference meeting of the 27 EU government leaders to discuss the European Commission proposal. 
The EU executive has proposed borrowing 750 billion euros from the market to replenish a new recovery fund to help revive European economies hardest hit by coronavirus, particularly Italy and Spain.
""We view the proposal from the Commission as intelligent and balanced,"" Costa said after the meeting.
Portugal, whose export-oriented, tourism-dependent economy has also been seriously damaged by the coronavirus crisis, would receive 26.5 billion euros ($29.73 billion) from the fund, composed of 15.5 billion euros in non-repayable grants and 10.9 billion in loans.
The 27 leaders did not resolve differences on Friday over how to structure the fund, with the balance of loans and grants still to be agreed, the Commission president said. {nB5N28S01F]
The Portuguese central bank forecast on Tuesday that GDP would contract 9.5% in 2020, the biggest drop in economic activity since the 1930s Great Depression.
With 38,089 confirmed coronavirus infections and 1,524 deaths, Portugal has kept its case toll comparatively low.
But with several hundred new cases detected per day in the past month, some European countries have limited entry to travellers from Portugal, prompting the foreign ministry to declare on Thursday it ""reserved the right"" to reciprocate with its own restrictions.
Costa said it was not ""the practice of Portugal to retaliate"" but that its high testing rate - ranking sixth in Europe in the number of tests per million inhabitants - had led to the impression of more cases than countries doing less tests.

""Countries which do a third or half of the tests Portugal does cannot compare to Portugal,"" Costa said.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Wealthy nations grouped together within the Paris Club of creditors have offered Cuba a one-year moratorium on payment of debt that has been in default for more than three decades, according to two diplomats with knowledge of the negotiations.
Cuba, earlier this year, had asked for a two-year moratorium and the waiving of penalties for overdue payments due to the new coronavirus pandemic.
“The offer requires new negotiations in the spring of 2021 on the unpaid maturities as well as the scheme of future payments,” one diplomat said, requesting anonymity.
“They will also have to pay the penalties on the money they owe,” he said.
The Paris Club and Cuban government did not respond to a request for comment.
The 2015 Paris Club agreement, seen by Reuters, forgave $8.5 billion of $11.1 billion, representing debt Cuba defaulted on in 1986, plus charges. Repayment of the remaining debt in annual installments was backloaded through 2033 and some of that money was allocated to funds for investments in Cuba.
Under the agreement interest was forgiven through 2020, and after that is just 1.5 pct of the total debt still due.
The agreement states if Cuba does not meet an annual payment schedule in full it will be charged late interest for that portion in arrears.
Cuba owed an estimated $80 million last year, paying some countries in full, but not others, including the largest creditors Spain, France and Japan.
Cuba last reported foreign debt of $18.2 billion in 2016, and experts believe it has risen significantly since then. The country is not a member of the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank.
The Cuba group of the 19-member Paris Club comprises Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Britain, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.

1012,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>",India's pursuit of global investors hits turbulence,"By Marc Jones and Saikat Chatterjee
LONDON (Reuters) - India's ambition to attract more foreign money into its financial markets is being buffeted again, having only just started to make progress after years of talk but very little action.
Deadly clashes between Indian and Chinese troops on the Himalayan border, a surge in coronavirus cases and its second sovereign credit rating cut of the month on Thursday has thrown the country back into the international spotlight this week.
It is unfortunate timing, coming just months after Indian policy makers embarked on a fresh drive to open the country's bond markets to global investors, but adds to a list of issues stacking up.
After years of rapid growth, India's economy is facing its worst recession in recent history, unemployment has been catapulted to an unprecedented 24%, and extra government spending is expected to leave a yawning 11% budget deficit that will push the debt-to-GDP ratio beyond 80%.
""The coronavirus pandemic has significantly weakened India's growth outlook for this year and exposed the challenges associated with a high public-debt burden,"" ratings agency Fitch said as it joined Moody's (NYSE:MCO) in cutting the country's rating.
The moves leave it teetering on the last rung of investment grade and a possible return to 'junk' status for the first time in nearly 14 years. Fitch cited doubts whether growth rates of 6-7% could be reclaimed, while Moody's broader concern is that remedies needed to strengthen fiscal health have barely begun.
Mark Evans, investment analyst for emerging market debt and currency at Ninety One, said a further downgrade would ""likely trigger a knee-jerk negative reaction across all Indian assets"".
Brazil to South Africa in recent years have shown the cost of losing your investment grade stripes but what matters more, Evans added, was whether there was willingness and ability to get fundamentals back on a sounder footing.
""The coronavirus pandemic is a global shock and is not unique to India,"" Sanjeev Sanyal, principle chief economic adviser at the Ministry of Finance, New Delhi told Reuters in response to questions about the rating worries.
""As far as our ability to service external debt is concerned, India's foreign exchange reserves of $500 billion and rising are more than adequate to meet all foreign obligations.""

QUESTION OF TIMING
Policymakers have been talking about opening up India's financial sector and internationalising the use of the rupee for more than a decade, with little progress.
One element of the recent reform plans was to bring foreign investors into Indian markets in broadly the way China has over the last decade.
World Bank head David Malpass has noted India's equity market capitalization had grown to over $2.2 trillion but its debt market remains at a ""nascent stage of development"".
Less than 4% of government bonds are held by foreigners compared to 20%-40% in nearby Indonesia and Malaysia, according to Institute of International Finance (IIF) deputy chief economist Sergi Lanau. Corporate-bond issuance was roughly 4% of GDP, which is also much less than other big emerging markets.
In March, the central bank took its first real stab at addressing this, moving away from 6% limits on foreign ownership of government bonds and allowing unlimited access on a select group of benchmarks, under Fully Accessible Route (FAR) plan.
The previous limits have kept India's bonds out of top global investment indexes like the JPMorgan-run GBI-EM or Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Global Aggregate which attract emerging market-focused money managers worldwide.
Noting the FAR changes, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) this month flagged India as one of four countries vying for possible GBI-EM inclusion. It could have chunky 7.8% weighting in the index, though with only 9% of debt stock currently covered by the new rules, the U.S. bank stopped short of suggesting it was imminent.
Jayesh Mehta, India country treasurer at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), is bullish that at least one of the big indexes will include it soon, though others think it remains some way off. The Barclays Bloomberg index requires an investment grade rating too.
 Aviva  (LON:AV) fund manager Stuart Ritson is one of the doubters. He thinks the prospect of more interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India still makes the country's bonds attractive at present. But $14 billion worth have been sold by foreign investors this year. Outflows from Indian stocks also hit a three-year high in the March quarter.
BofA's Mehta also sees little progress in making the rupee a global power-currency. Masala bonds -- rupee-denominated bonds issued outside India -- have emerged, but there is little incentive for firms to invoice internationally in the currency.
The rupee's share of daily FX market turnover has gradually crept up to 1.7% but that compare to 4.3% for China's yuan where Beijing has been more proactive is pushing yuan bonds.
(GRAPHIC - BIS graphic on market share: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgporwmmvd/BIS%20Graphic.JPG)
New Delhi's reluctance to issue dollar-denominated bonds might also cut the government's options at a time when the a gaping budget hole needs to be plugged. A ratings downgrade would only make the job tougher.
""We certainly need to watch that space given the level of shock to the system we are seeing now,"" said Neeraj Seth, head of Asian credit at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).

2/EXIT TALK
Economies are only just exiting stringent coronavirus lockdowns, but some policymakers are already hinting at another kind of exit - from their crisis-related stimulus. 
Not all of them, however. The Fed has assured markets it won't balk at further policy easing. But comments by the Bank of England, the People's Bank of China and the Norges Bank have surprised some -- the latter has even flagged plans to raise rates from 2022.
The BOE cited signs of economic recovery as a reason to slow the pace of its bond buying. And PBOC governor Yi Gang said policymakers should consider the ""timely withdrawal of policy tools in advance"" because of the potential for a ""hangover"". The PBOC is seen not cutting rates for the second straight month.
Data showing UK public debt surpassing 100% of GBP will reinforce fears of a debt surge stemming from emergency blank cheques. Markets aren't spooked yet, especially as the Fed remains in easing mode. But stay tuned for more exit strategy talk.

3/V, U, L, PMI
What shape will it be? - The V of a swift rebound, or the U of an (eventual) grind higher, punctuated by coronavirus scares, news of job cuts, social unrest and corporate bankruptcies? Or the depressing flatline of an L? Flash estimates of June business activity may give us some indication. 
Signs are that despite new infections in China and some U.S. states, the worst is over for big economies. Chinese factory activity returned to growth in May, while most countries saw a bounce in retail sales and manufacturing. U.S. and European purchasing managers' indexes (PMI) turned higher in May even if they remained in contraction territory.
June PMIs should reflect more positive momentum coming through as lockdowns eased further. Then again, recent market swings suggest there's just one economic indicator in focus for investors these days, and that's the coronavirus case count. 
(GRAPHIC - Global manufacturing PMIs hit by coronavirus: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdpzqzmwvw/Theme1806.PNG)
4/EASY RIDER
After tapping on the brakes, is the People's Bank of China again feeling for the accelerator? The government has flagged a cut to banks' reserve ratios, which would free up cash for loans. But anyone hoping for a full-throttle response should brace for disappointment. 
The PBOC is seen holding interest rates steady in June for the second straight month. It is also draining money from the financial system, aiming to direct stimulus away from arbitrage plays and into the real economy. 
Governor Yi Gang has also made clear that any measures are temporary and bring risks of a ""hangover"". The easing path ahead seems to be narrow, not broad, and leading to credit rather than cash.
(GRAPHIC - China bond yields, RRR: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopakxxapa/Pasted%20image%201592542273811.png) 
5/HOW LOW?
Not much exit talk in other emerging markets where central banks are trying to reverse some of the economic devastation with swingeing interest rate cuts.
Brazil, Russia and Ukraine have delivered big reductions so now the spotlight falls on Turkey, Egypt, Mexico, Philippines and Hungary. Hungary, Philippines and Egypt are likely to leave rates unchanged but may flag some easing for later in the year.
Turkey might be more of an assured bet for a cut on June 25. Its move in May was the ninth straight reduction in an easing cycle that began last July. 
Expect a cut in Mexico too given a 30% drop in April industrial production and below-target inflation. Rates fell to 5.5% last month and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) predicts an end-2020 rate of 3%.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's central bank has collected 216 billion naira ($598 mln) from banks with excess cash holdings as part of measures to support the naira currency, banking sources said on Friday.
The naira has come under intense pressure in recent months during the coronavirus pandemic, a sharp fall in the price of oil - Nigeria's main export - and departing foreign investors, causing a large financing gap.
The currency has been hitting new lows on the over-the-counter spot and black markets since March after the central bank adjusted its official rate, implying a 15% devaluation, to absorb the impact of an oil price crash.
The naira traded at 385 on the official market this week, weaker than a quoted rate of 361, backed by the central bank.
Banking sources told Reuters the liquidity withdrawal came before a foreign currency auction on Friday.
Results of the auction were due later in the day.
""The central bank is trying to manage the FX rate using the CRR (cash reserve ratio),"" one banker said, adding that the debits had become frequent and over the 27.5% limit.
He said offshore lenders were the most affected on the levies since they don't operate retail business and are debited from their corporate deposits or borrowings.
The bank is selling forex to importers and individuals with dollar expenses to keep its economy afloat. But it is yet to resume forex sales to investors that have sold assets and need to leave the country.
The central bank did not respond to a request for comment.

Lagarde addressed EU leaders, meeting by videoconference to wrangle over how to engineer a recovery from the deep recession caused by three months of coronavirus lockdowns in most European countries.
""(The) EU economy is experiencing a dramatic fall,"" she told the gathering, according to officials.
""Decisive and effective action by both national governments and European actors has proven its worth: they paved the way for a rebound towards year-end and helped to buy some time. This is reflected in market sentiment, but failure to deliver could lead to a change in that sentiment,"" she said.

In addition to the July video conference meeting, the committee also wants to invite the Bundesbank, one of the 19 national central banks that make up the ECB, to a quarterly dialogue, minutes of a June 18 committee meeting showed.
The development comes after Germany's highest court last month gave the ECB three months to justify bond purchases under the flagship stimulus programme it introduced in 2015 or lose the Bundesbank as a participant.
In its ruling, the court also called on the German parliament and government to challenge the ECB on the matter.
The May 5 ruling has posed a conundrum for Berlin, which is bound to respect the Karlsruhe court but at the same time does not want to erode the independence of the ECB, whose unprecedented stimulus has kept the euro zone intact.
The committee minutes confirm a story in Der Spiegel magazine, which reported that by setting up the quarterly 'monetary dialogue' with the Bundesbank, parliament wanted to meet the court's call to ensure more transparency on ECB policy.
""We want to fulfil this duty,"" conservative lawmaker Hans Michelbach, the committee's chairman, told Der Spiegel.
The Karlsruhe court said the Bundesbank could no longer be part of the bond-buying plan unless the ECB can show its bond purchases ""are not disproportionate to the economic and fiscal policy effects"", the judges said.

The bond-buying programme kept the euro zone in one piece during the sovereign debt crisis but critics argue it has flooded markets with cheap money and encouraged over-spending by some governments.

Investing.com -- It’s a relatively quiet end to a busy week, with few economic data or earnings on the calendar and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell unlikely to add much to what he told Congress when he takes part in a conference later. His colleagues Eric Rosengren and Loretta Mester may have something fresher to say.  EU leaders meet to discuss their recovery plan, but markets are subdued ahead of the quarterly expiry of options and futures on stock products. Oil prices are rising again as the economic re-opening narrative dominates ‘second-wave’ fears. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, June 19th
1. A Flurry of Fed Speakers
Four senior officials from the Federal Reserve will fill the vacuum created by the lack of economic data and earnings on a light day for the diary. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren gets the ball rolling at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), to be followed by Chairman Jerome Powell, top banking supervisor Randall Quarles and the Cleveland Fed’s Loretta Mester in the course of the day.
With Powell having already spent two days this week talking to Congress, it’s not clear what more remains to be said about the course of the economy, beyond the officials’ reaction to the latest labor market data and the sustainability of the rebound so far.
2. Europe leaders meet
European Union leaders will discuss the European Commission’s proposal for a 750 billion euro  ($840 billion) recovery package, which controversially includes 500 billion euro worth of grants to member states, in what has been seen as a big step towards more formal fiscal transfers within the bloc.
They’ll also be discussing the EU’s new multi-year budget framework, which of course means that there is no chance of major decisions at the meeting, given that the EU invariably thrashes these things out over months. However, the mood music will be important, with leaders anxious to convey to markets and voters that they’re serious about managing the current crisis better than they did the last one.
3. Stocks set to open higher ahead of 'quadruple witching'
Stocks are set to open slightly higher again, after a mixed close on Thursday. Friday marks the so-called ‘quadruple witching’ of expiry dates for derivative products on both indexes and individual stocks, which traditionally generates some elevated volatility.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract was up 220 points or 0.9%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 0.7% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.8%.
The mood is being supported by, among other things, news that movie theater operator Cinemark (NYSE:CNK) will reopen most of its theaters by the end of July, without requiring visitors to wear masks, while JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) will start selling tickets for 30 new routes under its post-pandemic strategy.
4. Sterling slides as U.K. retail rebound overshadowed by debt news
U.K. retail sales rebounded more sharply than expected in May, but the news was overshadowed by other data showing the steep rise in government debt as a result of the pandemic.
Retail sales rose 12% from what will probably turn out to have been the low point of the cycle in April, well ahead of expectations. However, the Office for National Statistics said in a separate release that national debt had exceeded 100% of GDP for the first time since 1963, due to the heavy borrowing started by the government to pay for its crisis mitigation measures.
The pound hit a three-month low against the euro and a new low for the month against the dollar, with sentiment still being hurt by the Bank of England’s apparent reluctance to increase monetary stimulus on Thursday. The BoE increased the overall envelope for its quantitative easing purchases by 100 billion pounds ($125 billion), but indicated that the pace of bond-buying will slow.
5. Crude hits $40 after OPEC+ reassurance
U.S. crude oil prices rose above $40 a barrel for the first time in 11 days after reassurance that the OPEC+ group of producers are largely sticking to their deal on output restraint.
By 6:30, WTI futures had retraced slightly to be up 2.7% at $39.87, while the global benchmark Brent contract was up 2.1% at $42.38 a barrel.
Elsewhere, Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian sovereign wealth fund and a key negotiator in the OPEC+ talks, said he saw little point in further extending the current output cuts beyond the end of July, given the rebound in demand. The cuts are due to start tapering in August."

Pensions stand to go up very sharply because of an expected leap in wage growth next year, reflecting the end of the government's coronavirus job retention scheme - under which many workers are currently getting 80% of their salary - this year.
Since June 2010, Britain's state pension has risen by whichever is higher of consumer price inflation, average earnings growth or 2.5%, under a system called the 'triple lock'.
""A way forward might be to temporarily suspend the wages element of the lock,"" Mel Stride, chair of parliament's Treasury Committee, said. 
""This might not entirely conform to the Conservative Party manifesto, but I think most people would recognise that a potential double-digit percentage increase is unrealistic."" 
Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, told the Treasury Committee last week that average earnings in Britain might bounce back by 18% next year, which represented an unrealistic increase for pensioners.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said on Wednesday that the government had no plans to break the triple lock after media reports that finance minister Rishi Sunak was considering the option.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Major central banks across Europe and Japan will reduce the frequency of their seven-day dollar liquidity-providing operations from July as the market tension caused by the coronavirus pandemic has eased, the Bank of Japan said on Friday.
In view of improvements in U.S. dollar funding conditions and after consulting with the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank have jointly decided to reduce the frequency of their seven-day operations from daily to three times a week, the BOJ said in a statement.
The change will take effect on July 1, it said.
""These central banks stand ready to re-adjust the provision of U.S dollar liquidity as warranted by market conditions,"" the statement said.
""The swap lines among these central banks are available standing facilities and serve as an important liquidity backstop to ease strains in global funding markets,"" it said.
In a bid to address the market turbulence caused by the pandemic, the Fed in March increased the frequency of seven-day maturity operations from weekly to daily as part of its swap line arrangements with the major central banks.

Dollars were in huge demand in March and supply was tight, but conditions have stabilised recently after a raft of measures taken by major central banks to ease market jitters over the fallout from the pandemic.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders began the process of approving an unprecedented stimulus package for their coronavirus-ravaged economies on Friday, aware of the need to deliver help quickly, but still divided over its final size and terms.
The 27 national heads started a video conference at 0800 GMT to discuss recovery for the bloc that has lost over 100,000 lives to COVID-19 and faces an unprecedented economic downturn threatening its stability and global standing.
""It's a crisis without precedent that has had an enormous impact - economic, social and also on the viability of the EU,"" said a senior EU diplomat. ""To show that Europe protects, we cannot take any longer on this, as delays will only make things more difficult and more expensive."" 
Under discussion is the EU's next budget of around 1.1 trillion euros for 2021-27, and an attached recovery fund of a proposed 750 billion euros borrowed by the EU Commission.
""Together ... this is a huge stimulus of 1,850 billion euros. It does not only help the economies of the countries which were hit hardest by the virus. It also helps the countries whose economies have been hit hard indirectly because of the lockdowns,"" Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said.
The aid is to be disbursed mainly among worst-hit nations, like Italy and Spain, but many differences must still be settled before the necessary unanimous agreement. Officials and diplomats expect a deal could come in July. 
""We have a collective responsibility to deliver,"" the leaders' chairman Charles Michel said.
NEEDY SOUTH, FRUGAL NORTH
While the already highly indebted south is calling for grants without too many conditions, the more thrifty north wants only conditional loans. 
""Conditionality is a big issue. An agreement on reforms could create room for manoeuvre on grants,"" one diplomat said.
Sweden, Denmark Austria and the Netherlands, the so-called ""frugal four"", also believe the proposed recovery fund is too big and allocation of the money is not sufficiently linked to the pandemic.
Eastern EU countries say too much money will go to the south and want to maintain an earlier spending focus on agriculture and closing development gaps with the richer west.
Wealthy net payers to EU coffers, including the frugal four and Germany, want to retain past rebates on their contributions that others want scrapped and there is no agreement on how to eventually repay the Commission borrowing.

Officials expect EU leaders will need at least one or two more meetings in person next month to reach a final deal, which would also mark a step towards more integration in the bloc after the damaging setback of Brexit.

LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers bought much more than expected in May as the country gradually relaxed its coronavirus lockdown and online retailers boomed, adding to signs that the economy is moving away from its historic crash in March and April.
But official data also showed public borrowing hit a record high as the government opened the spending taps and public debt passed 100% of economic output.
Sales volumes in May jumped by a record 12.0% after an unprecedented 18.0% slump in April.
The rise was at the top end of economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll but still left sales 13.1% down on a year ago.
Most shops in England remained closed until June 15, suggesting a further increase is likely this month.
Consumer confidence in June was the strongest since the lockdown began but remained weak, a separate survey showed.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Thursday the economy appeared to be shrinking a bit less severely in the first half of 2020 than the BoE had feared. But there was no guarantee of a strong rebound and unemployment would rise.
""May's recovery in retail sales should not be interpreted as a sign that the economy is embarking on a healthy V-shaped recovery from COVID-19,"" Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.
Household incomes would take a hit when a government support scheme covering 9 million jobs is wound up in October, he said.
Britain closed non-essential retailers in late March and only a small number such as garden centres reopened in May. 
Sales at non-food stores increased by 24% in May, but were still 42% down on a year earlier, with clothes stores the hardest-hit category, down by more than 60%. Fuel sales jumped by 49% as people in England got back in their cars.
Online sales rose to a third of all spending, a new record.
BORROWING SURGES
The ONS data also laid bare the scale of the hit to Britain's public finances.
Public sector net borrowing hit 55.2 billion pounds ($68.7 billion) in May - nine times the level for May 2019 and a record high after April's reading was revised down sharply.
""The best way to restore our public finances to a more sustainable footing is to safely reopen our economy so people can return to work,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies and Citi said Britain would still be borrowing heavily in five years' time. 
Government borrowing is effectively being underwritten by the BoE which topped its bond-buying programme by 100 billion pounds on Thursday.
A measure of public sector debt increased to 1.95 trillion pounds, topping 100% of economic output for the first time since 1963, when Britain was still paying off Second World War debts.
That measure reflected the record 20% contraction of the economy in April as well as the borrowing surge.
In April and May, borrowing of 103.7 billion pounds was a towering 87 billion pounds higher than a year earlier but below the 122 billion pounds government forecasters have predicted.
""Encouragingly, the government isn't struggling to finance this extra borrowing, while the cost of servicing this debt is still on course to fall,"" said Charlie McCurdy, a researcher at the Resolution Foundation think tank.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 01:25AM ET</span>",Air freight rates head back to earth as virus-driven boom cools,"By Jamie Freed and Lisa Baertlein
SYDNEY/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - An air cargo boom driven by demand for protective gear against the coronavirus has peaked and rates, while still 50% above normal levels, are falling in a worrying trend for airlines relying on freight revenue in the absence of passengers.
Declining prices may deal a blow to carriers that are scrambling to move cargo to offset weak passenger revenues as they rebuild networks by flying reopened routes with half-empty cabins.
""The early-mover advantage has disappeared and I can see why some of the rates are coming down,"" said Phil Seymour, president of aviation consulting firm IBA. ""The market is becoming flooded with belly freight capacity.""
About half of the air cargo carried worldwide normally flies in the belly of passenger jets rather than in dedicated freighters. 
But flight cuts due to weak travel demand squeezed freight capacity at a time when demand for masks, gloves and other protective gear was surging, leading many airlines to fly empty passenger jets as freighters.
Global air cargo capacity was down 27% in the week starting May 31 compared with a year ago, according to Accenture (NYSE:ACN) data, but capacity is rising as passenger flights return.
Air freight rates from China to the United States surged to more than $7 a kilogram in April and May and China-Europe rates were at more than $6 a kilo, Frederic Horst of Cargo Facts Consulting said. Rates have since softened, although they remain 40%-50% above normal levels closer to $3 a kilo, he added.
""I wouldn't say they have come back to earth, but they are heading toward it,"" Brian Bourke, chief growth officer of U.S.-based SEKO Logistics said of rates.
The International Air Transport Association estimates cargo will contribute 26% of airline industry revenue in 2020, up from 12% in 2019, due mostly to a sharp fall in passenger revenue that will lead to forecast losses of more than $84 billion.
Air freight demand had been depressed before the pandemic due to subdued global economic growth and a U.S.-China trade war and recessionary conditions will make for a slow recovery, said Oliver Plogmann, Singapore-based aviation lead at Accenture.
""We estimate around 100 passenger freighters are flying globally and we think the number is going to reduce over the next weeks and months when more capacity comes back into the market because it is simply not viable,"" he said.
Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293), one of the world's biggest freight carriers, said last week that demand for medical supplies had softened in the latter half of May. It flew nearly 900 cargo flights with passenger planes in May but that could be reduced as demand falls.
Taiwan's China Airlines Ltd (TW:2610) said it was concerned about the outlook for cargo given there was no obvious global economic recovery trend.
""PPE (personal protective equipment) via air freight has drastically slowed down in the last couple of couple weeks, and it's probably because the second round can afford to go ocean freight,"" said David Goldberg, chief executive of DHL Global Forwarding USA. 
""We've seen more rationalisation of the air freight rates. They're still at high levels.""

Logistics group C.H. Robinson said it helped the state of Minnesota save $500,000 in shipping costs for surgical gowns by selecting fast boat services over air freight.

1027,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 11:54PM ET</span>",China’s $136 Billion E-Commerce Haul Signals a Consumer Comeback,"(Bloomberg) --
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. handled record sales of $136 billion during the country’s biggest online shopping gala of the post-pandemic era, suggesting China’s nascent consumer spending recovery has legs.
The twin e-commerce giants put nationwide consumption to its first major test since the pandemic with the annual “6.18” summer extravaganza that concluded Thursday. Transactions across JD’s online platforms during the 18-day marathon leapt 34% to 269.2 billion yuan ($38 billion), a faster pace than in 2019. And Alibaba said it handled 698.2 billion yuan during its own campaign, without a year-earlier comparison. JD’s shares stood largely unchanged after rising 3.5% in their Hong Kong debut.
China’s largest retailers counted on pent-up demand during the event -- created by JD to commemorate its June 18 founding anniversary -- to make up for lost sales during a coronavirus-stricken March quarter. Global brands and smaller merchants alike stocked up on goods for months in anticipation of an online bargain spree surpassed only by the Nov. 11 Singles’ Day in scale. The final tally underscored how hundreds of millions of shoppers remain willing to spend after the world’s No. 2 economy contracted for the first time in decades, especially given huge discounts as Covid-19 shifted buying to the internet.
“The strong GMV at 6.18 will help to dispel market anxiety about virus-related disruptions,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Vey-Sern Ling said. “Chinese e-commerce platforms will probably deliver strong 2Q sales and profit recovery due to pent-up consumer demand and an accelerated shift to digital consumption channels driven by the virus.”
This year’s deals-fest culminated with the biggest bargains Thursday and featured more generous subsidies than ever before, as well as an unprecedented cohort of live-streaming personalities. Competition also intensified with the likes of ByteDance Ltd. and Kuaishou -- whose video app now sells JD goods -- vying for buyers.
“Chinese and foreign brands had sluggish sales due to the pandemic, and 6.18 has become their most important opportunity in the first half,” JD Retail Chief Executive Officer Xu Lei said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. For discretionary items like home appliances, “we’ve seen a recovery in consumption.”

Chinese retail suffered a record collapse in the first three months of 2020. While it’s on the mend, latest data shows private consumption still sluggish, dashing hopes of a V-shaped recovery as people head back to work. The picture is complicated by the fact that Covid-19 has kept people away from stores and shifted an unknown proportion of retail activity online, propping up online purchases.
JD has projected revenue growth of 20% to 30% this quarter. Xu -- widely viewed as the front-runner to succeed billionaire founder Richard Liu -- says JD is on track to meet that goal and isn’t threatened by competitors encroaching upon its turf, like in consumer gadgets.
“I don’t dance with them, I dance with users,” he said.
Signs had grown this month that China’s e-commerce giants were on track for record sums as measured by gross merchandise value, or total value of goods sold. During the first ten hours of its 6.18 campaign, Alibaba’s Tmall business-to-consumer marketplace logged sales 50% higher than during the same period last year, after participating brands doubled. JD has said sales of imports like HP (NYSE:HPQ) laptops and Dyson hairdryers soared, while it’s selling more fresh produce in smaller cities.

Initiated in 2014 as a riposte to Alibaba’s Singles’ Day, 6.18 has become yet another annual ritual for e-commerce companies and their offline partners from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. to Suning.com Co. Beyond headline figures, it’s less clear how much it contributes to the bottom line given the enormous discounting involved.
“The result is good as far as growth is concerned, but in terms of margins, all the players will see the consequences,” said Steven Zhu, analyst at Pacific Epoch. “It’s just what I call paid-GMV for all the platforms. It’s the time that people have to have a good number after the coronavirus, so they just do it at whatever the cost.”
Alibaba, along with brands on its platforms, committed cash and other coupons worth a total of 14 billion yuan, according to the company. JD said it offered 10 billion yuan in subsidies.
“User growth and retention, and the digitization of brands and merchants are key considerations” when Alibaba pushes subsidies during promotions like 6.18, said Alibaba Vice President Mike Gu, who heads Tmall’s fashion and consumer goods businesses.

More broadly, sales of fast-moving consumer goods on the Tmall and Taobao marketplaces in the June quarter have so far exceeded the pace of 2019’s final quarter, Gu said in an interview. Thanks to 6.18, apparel growth this month has also climbed back to pre-Covid-19 levels, he added.
Live-streaming is also playing a bigger role during this year’s 6.18, at a time Covid-19 is fueling an unprecedented boom in online media. Alibaba’s Taobao Live championed the use of influencers to sell everything from lipstick to rockets, prompting rivals like JD and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc. to follow suit.
Social media companies like TikTok-owner ByteDance and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.-backed Kuaishou are jumping on the bandwagon. Their mini-video platforms in China have lured a long list of tech chieftains hawking products of their own to live-streaming fans: The latest was NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc.’s usually reclusive founder, William Ding. Last week, his debut on Kuaishou amassed 72 million yuan of sales in just four hours.
“I’ve never eaten beef jerky as tasty as this in the last twenty years,” the billionaire said during the livestream.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government raised its economic assessment in June for the first time since 2018 as a sharp deterioration caused by the new coronavirus outbreak had nearly come to an end.
Although the economy remained in an ""extremely severe situation"" due to the coronavirus pandemic, it had ""almost stopped worsening"", the June report said.
Japan is expected to suffer its worst postwar slump this quarter, but the government's new economic assessment took heart from signs of improvement in consumer spending and business sentiment after the phased lifting of a state of emergency in late May.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared the emergency in April and asked people to stay home and businesses to close to prevent the virus spreading. 
""The economy is still on a slightly downward trend but the sharp deterioration has ended,"" said an official at the Cabinet Office, adding that any pick-up in the economy would depend on how jobs and wages pan out.
The government upgraded its view on consumer spending for the first time since January 2018, noting signs of improvement as retailers and restaurants re-opened.
And the government also raised its assessment on business sentiment for the first time since April 2017, saying it was showing signs of picking up too after a service sector sentiment index rose for the first time in May.

But, as external demand remained subdued, the government kept its view on exports, saying they were ""falling rapidly"" and factory output was also falling.

1030,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 07:55PM ET</span>",Column: Spend or hoard? Fate of forced savings could define pandemic recovery - Mike Dolan,"(The author is editor-at-large for finance and markets at Reuters News. Any views expressed here are his own)
By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - Many households have built up a stash of savings during the coronavirus lockdowns of the past three months -- and how they view them may dictate the speed of recovery from the pandemic.
Although the shock has caused spikes in unemployment, most households spent lockdown periods either working from home, furloughed or on direct government income support. And with few goods or services available to buy, their savings have soared.
Whether people see these unexpected cash hoards as a windfall or a buffer against future uncertainties is likely to determine the speed of the recovery, at least this year.
If the public treats the money like a tax rebate, spending could surge, says Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS's global wealth management arm. He points to U.S. tax rebates in 2001 and 2008, money from which was fully spent within about two quarters -- mostly on durable goods such as furniture and consumer electronics.
As lockdowns lift with no second wave of virus infections so far, pent-up spending could be a big boost to third-quarter consumption -- underlining why some investors still believe in a ""V-shaped"" recovery.
""This involuntary saving could be spent. It will depend on fear and trust,"" Donovan said. ""Fear of the virus and fear of unemployment need to be low. Trust in government policy needs to be relatively high.
""These are, after all, savings that many people never wanted in the first place -- at least as far as saving on entertainment and services is concerned.""
CASH STASH
U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data last week showed the personal savings rate almost trebled to a record 33%, or $6.15 trillion, in April -- having already doubled to more than $2 trillion in March. In the six months before, the average was nearly $1.3 trillion, or just under 8%.
Directly comparable data for Europe, which locked down earlier, is not yet available, but the European Commission is forecasting that household savings rates will nearly double to 20% this year. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) meanwhile points to a record jump of over 300 billion euros in euro zone private sector deposit inflows in March, although that will include firms building up cash to survive the freeze. 
And on Tuesday, Bank of England data showed UK household deposits rose by 30 billion pounds over March and April compared to average monthly increases of 5 billion pounds in the six months prior. There was also record net repayment of consumer credit of 7.4 billion pounds in April alone.
Donovan notes that despite the large aggregate numbers, the distribution is scattered. 
For many furloughed workers in Europe, for example, income has been at 80% of normal levels. But spending has probably declined by 20-30% across the major economies.
Some American households may even see a temporary rise in weekly incomes as they claim jobless benefits of $1,000 per week -- higher than half of all working wages. They also get a $1,200 one-off government payment.
It is higher income groups that tend to save more, however, as they spend a smaller share of their incomes on food and essentials. Much of that discretionary spending is on services such as travel, restaurants and entertainment that have largely been unavailable during the crisis.
POLICY TWISTS
While major uncertainties remain about the reopening of economies, job security, the trajectory of the virus and a potential vaccine, government and central bank policies will help determine whether this money leaves bank accounts as quickly as it arrived.
Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff argues that preventing cash hoarding is one reason why the U.S. Federal Reserve should consider adopting negative interest rates -- effectively a charge for not spending -- as European central banks have done. 
Others fear zero and negative deposit rates just lead to a ""paradox of thrift"", where people put aside even more to make up for lost returns -- further swelling the savings glut.
For governments, the issue may also inform post-pandemic support. With private consumption the main driver of economic activity -- as high as 70% of GDP in the United States --  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economists say changes in savings patterns could easily offset any new fiscal measures.
They argue that fear of future tax rises to fix public finances could prompt household caution -- so-called ""Ricardian equivalence"", a phenomenon sketched by 19th century economist David Ricardo suggesting the public's behaviour in response to government saving or borrowing offsets the impact of policies.

What is clear is that current bloated savings levels mean confidence, or lack of it, could have a snowballing impact in the second half of 2020. Financial markets are already taking that on board.

1031,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 07:45PM ET</span>","Trump renews threat to cut ties with Beijing, a day after high-level U.S.-China talks","By Andrea Shalal and David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday renewed his threat to cut ties with China, a day after his top diplomats held talks with Beijing and his trade representative said he did not consider decoupling the U.S. and Chinese economies a viable option.
The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia described U.S.-China relations as ""tense"" after their first high-level face-to-face diplomatic talks in months, although he said Beijing did recommit to the first part of a trade deal reached this year and that coming weeks would show if there had been progress. 
Trump has made rebalancing the massive U.S. trade deficit with China a top priority, but relations have worsened steadily as his campaign for re-election in November heats up.
""It was not Ambassador Lighthizer’s fault (yesterday in Committee) in that perhaps I didn’t make myself clear,"" Trump said in a tweet referring to his trade representative, Robert Lighthizer.
""But the U.S. certainly does maintain a policy option, under various conditions, of a complete decoupling from China.""
Lighthizer told a House of Representatives committee on Wednesday he did not see that as viable.
""Do I think that you can sit down and decouple the United States economy from the Chinese economy?"" he said. ""No, I think that was a policy option years ago. I don't think it's a ... reasonable policy option at this point.""
His office had no immediate comment on Trump's tweet.
U.S.-China relations have reached their lowest point in years since the coronavirus pandemic that began in China hit the United States hard, and Trump and his administration have repeatedly accused Beijing of not being transparent about the outbreak. 
MULTIPLE POINTS OF FRICTION
Among multiple points of friction, the countries are also at odds over China's moves to impose new security legislation on Hong Kong, which have prompted Trump to initiate a process to eliminate special U.S. treatment for the territory.
Trump made clear the deterioration in the relationship last month when he said he had no interest in speaking right now to President Xi Jinping, whom he has hailed as a friend, and suggesting he could even cut ties with China. 
Lighthizer said he expected to see more supply chains moving to the United States because of tax and regulatory changes, but also noted that the U.S.-China trade deal would result in significant positive changes and increased Chinese purchases of U.S. goods and services.
The Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal calls for China to buy $200 billion in additional U.S. goods and services over two years, but skeptics say the pandemic and resulting economic slowdowns will make it difficult for Beijing to reach its targets for this year. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, for a day of talks in Hawaii on Wednesday, but those appear to have done little to improve the mood.
As the Hawaii meeting began, Trump signed legislation calling for sanctions against those responsible for repression of Uighur Muslims in China's Xinjiang region, prompting Beijing to threaten retaliation.
David Stilwell, the assistant secretary for East Asia, told reporters that China's attitude in the talks could not be described as forthcoming and described relations as ""tense.""
He said recent Chinese actions, over India, in the South China Sea and over Hong Kong, had not been constructive and that Washington looked forward to seeing China reconsider its plans for security legislation for Hong Kong. 
At the same time, Stilwell said China did recommit to following through on the trade agreement and added that efforts to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons were another area of potential cooperation.
""The trade deal – the Chinese have recommitted to that numerous times ... and they insist that they will follow through,"" Stilwell said. ""This is a good acid test to see if they will be cooperative partners.""
""We’ll see in the next week or two, or however long it takes, (if) they begin to live up to their commitments,"" he said.
China described the Hawaii talks as ""constructive,"" but its Foreign Ministry said Yang told Pompeo that Washington needed to respect Beijing's positions on key issues and halt its interference in matters such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Xinjiang, while working to repair relations.
Hours after the meeting ended, China said its top parliamentary body would review draft Hong Kong security legislation during a session that began on Thursday.
Earlier, foreign ministers of the G7 countries, including Pompeo, issued a statement calling on China not to follow through with the legislation, which critics call an assault on the territory's democratic freedoms.

1032,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 07:15PM ET</span>","Slow UK recovery risks ballooning borrowing, IFS/Citi research shows","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's government will still be borrowing vast sums of money five years from now if the economy takes time to recover from the coronavirus fallout, new research published on Friday showed.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank and U.S. investment bank Citi said they thought it would take the economy ""several years"" to adjust to the pandemic, in contrast to scenarios from official forecasters showing a relatively swift rebound.
That would point to a budget deficit of around 130 billion pounds ($162 billion) - or 5% of GDP - in five years' time, more than double the forecast published by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in March.
Data due later on Friday are likely to show Britain is on course for a record increase in borrowing this financial year, to reach the highest level as a share of the economy since World War Two.
""Even so, with current low interest rates, additional borrowing now that boosts the economic recovery would still be worthwhile,"" IFS economist Isabel Stockton said. ""But once we are through the immediate crisis and the economy reaches a new normal, we will be left with elevated debt.""
Stockton added that a mix of tax rises and an acceptance that higher debt will need to be managed carefully seemed to be the most likely outcomes. 
Britain's emergency spending and tax cuts to soften the economic hit from the coronavirus crisis are likely to cost 132.5 billion pounds, the OBR said earlier this month.

It estimated new borrowing in the current financial year could approach 300 billion pounds as normal tax revenues dry up.

(Reuters) - Palantir Technologies Inc on Thursday said that Japanese insurance holding company Sompo Holdings Inc (T:8630)  is investing $500 million in the Silicon Valley data analytics company, whose clients range from global banks to the U.S. government and the Central Intelligence Agency.
The large investment from Sompo comes as Palantir has seen an uptick in demand for its products that help companies and governments manage the COVID-19 pandemic with data. The company declined to talk about Palantir’s latest valuation or its plans to go public. 
Reuters reported last week that Palantir is aiming to file confidentially with U.S. regulators for an initial public offering in the coming weeks, citing sources.
Palantir was valued at around $20 billion in its last fundraising round in 2015. In the private market, its shares have been trading in recent weeks at a valuation of between $10 billion and $14 billion, according to market sources.
Late last year, Palantir also launched a 50-50 joint venture with Sompo called Palantir Technologies Japan K.K. to service the Japanese government as well as commercial clients. And earlier this month another Japanese tech company, Fujitsu Limited, invested $50 million into Palantir in the United States. Both Sompo and Fujitsu are also customers of Palantir.

Co-founded in 2004 by billionaire and well-known tech investor Peter Thiel, the data analytics company has been involved in some of the U.S. government’s most politically sensitive projects, from identifying terrorists to the tracking of illegal immigrants. The company’s technology aided the U.S. government’s successful search for Osama bin Laden, according to multiple media reports.

Stay-at-home orders aimed at limiting the virus' spread led to a sharp drop in business and leisure travel, negatively impacting room occupancy taxes and other revenue collected by the governments, according to the Oxford Economics report released by the American Hotel & Lodging Association. 
The biggest tax losses are in California at $1.9 billion, New York and Florida at $1.3 billion each, and Nevada at $1.1 billion, the report said. 
Hotel occupancy taxes make up the bulk of the losses at $10.7 billion, followed by sales, gaming, personal income, and corporate taxes. The hotel industry directly generated almost $40 billion in state and local tax revenue in 2018, the association said.
While the virus outbreak has dramatically decreased city and state revenue, particularly from sales and income taxes, the budget hit from lower hotel occupancy taxes will be minor, according to Amy Laskey, a managing director at Fitch Ratings. 
""Typically, there's some restrictions on what you can use those revenues for, like they have to be used for tourism, so they tend to be small relative to total (local government and state) revenues,"" she said. 
Some governments have sold bonds backed by hotel tax revenue. Fitch in April put those issues on review, resulting so far in various actions, including rating outlook revisions to negative and one downgrade. 
The hotel industry has been hit hard by the pandemic with the hotel group projecting room occupancy will have its worst year on record in 2020. After dropping by 7.5 million jobs in April, leisure and hospitality employment increased by 1.2 million in May, according to the U.S. Labor Department.

1036,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 05:06PM ET</span>","Watchdogs, White House at odds over scrutiny of pandemic aid","By Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON(Reuters) - When Congress approved $2 trillion pandemic aid in March, many Democratic and Republican lawmakers agreed on safeguards against fraud and abuse to ensure that companies receiving the money use it to save American jobs.
But the Trump administration has advised agencies that they can largely ignore reporting requirements in the legislation designed to help a newly created watchdog group track how the money is spent, according to public documents and four people with knowledge of the matter.
Several lawmakers, nonprofit organizations and members of the watchdog group - the Pandemic Recovery Accountability Committee (PRAC) - say the avoidant approach proposed by the White House would violate the law. They contend it would keep taxpayers in the dark as to whether businesses such as airlines or hospitals use the cash to save jobs and keep the lights on - as Congress intended - or, for instance, spend it on management bonuses and other perks.
The dispute between the accountability committee and the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is the latest sign of tensions between independent investigators tasked with overseeing taxpayer money and Trump administration officials who have resisted calls for greater transparency in several key relief programs. 
The $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, passed in March, calls for organizations getting more than $150,000 in aid to document their spending to the dispensing federal agencies - who in turn must report that information to the accountability committee so it can scan for signs of fraud and abuse. The act requires recipients to report spending quarterly, along with a detailed description of the projects supported and the number of jobs created or preserved.
In April, however, the White House budget office wrote a memo to federal agencies telling them it did not believe such detailed reporting was required to comply with the law. The memo, a public document reviewed by Reuters, advised agencies that they could avoid the administration burden and satisfy the law instead by following ""existing reporting requirements"" for all federal spending, with ""minimal modifications.""
The accountability committee consists of independent watchdogs, known as inspectors general, from 21 federal offices. Created by Congress, the committee provides findings to both lawmakers and the administration. While Trump cannot disband the body, he can and already has ousted some of its members by removing them from their agency inspector general roles. 
Asked why the committee had told agencies they could rely on existing data reporting requirements, the White House budget office pointed to a section of its guidance in which it wrote that ""time is of the essence"" in getting funds to those in need.
The office also said that it is working with the accountability committee and inspectors general to ""ensure proper reporting and transparency."" 
Robert Westbrooks, director of the PRAC, said the White House directive did not appear to meet the CARES Act reporting requirements. He said the PRAC was talking regularly with the White House budget office to address data gaps, but declined to elaborate on those talks.
Some PRAC members and some lawmakers, including those on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, have privately pressed the White House budget office to comply with the law, according to a committee aide with knowledge of the discussions and another person who had been briefed on the matter. 
""Americans deserve to know where their hard earned tax dollars are going,"" said Senator Gary Peters, the lead Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is pushing for transparency and accountability measures.
SECRET BAILOUTS?
The disagreement over the reporting requirements is only the most recent example of the Trump administration’s reluctance to open the books on pandemic bailout spending.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has resisted naming businesses that got money from a $660 billion small business rescue fund, calling their names and amounts received “confidential” and “proprietary” business information.
On Monday, Mnuchin softened his stance, tweeting that he would discuss potential disclosures with Congress. On Tuesday, Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who is leading that discussion as chair of a small business committee, said the government planned to disclose information about larger aid awards, without specifying what would be released.
The Treasury Department also last month determined that states and local governments getting a total of $150 billion in aid were not subject the rules requiring detailed reporting of aid spending - or to any PRAC oversight. 
The Treasury's internal legal interpretation only came to light when the Treasury's inspector general disputed it in a brief audit report published on May 27. Last week, the PRAC wrote to lawmakers saying the Treasury opinion raised ""potentially significant transparency and oversight issues."" 
Treasury Department spokesperson Monica Crowley said that the agency is complying with the law and that its programs are already subject to oversight by Congress and other agencies.
""Further duplication of these oversight functions by the PRAC would not increase transparency or oversight,"" she said in a statement.
Over the past two months, Trump has also ousted three inspectors general serving on the PRAC, including Glenn Fine, the acting Pentagon inspector general who had been appointed as its chair. 
GET THE MONEY 'OUT THE DOOR'
The tussle over reporting to the accountability committee spilled into public view earlier this month during a Congressional hearing with the budget office's acting director Russell Vought, who approved the White House guidance.
""I don't see how that guidance comports with the law, and I don't see why ... we wouldn’t have more, rather than less, oversight,"" Republican Senator Rob Portman told Vought during the hearing. 
Vought told Portman that the guidance aimed to balance transparency requirements with getting the money ""out the door."" He said the office did not intend to ignore the law and would comply with it. 
Sean Moulton, a senior policy analyst at the Project on Government Oversight, said the reporting by aid recipients that the CARES Act requires is crucial to providing effective oversight of the massive stimulus program. With no details on how loans and grants are spent, he said, inspectors general will have limited ability to detect abuse.

""They'll catch some of these frauds,"" he said. ""With others, they may not know without this recipient data.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - St. Louis Federal Reserve bank President James Bullard said on Thursday that he is hopeful the worst of the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic may have passed in April, but the U.S. economy is not yet in the clear.
""I definitely don't think we're out of the woods,"" Bullard said during a virtual conference. ""We're still at a high, high risk level here. Any crisis, I think you have to keep in mind that many things can happen - many twists and turns can occur."" 
Bullard said he expects the U.S. economy to rebound more quickly than it did during the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis, but that the pace of the recovery will depend on the coronavirus. 
The shutdowns rolled out this year were appropriate to slow the spread of the virus, but they are not sustainable in the long term because many businesses cannot survive several months without revenue, Bullard said. 

""If you get massive business failures, you'll face depression risk or financial crisis risk or both,"" Bullard said. ""And we want to stay out of those situations,"" he said, adding that his base case is for that dire scenario to be avoided.

1039,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 03:10PM ET</span>","Brazil set to test lower bound on rates, despite misgivings","By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank will likely be forced to put aside its misgivings and cut interest rates much further, testing the ""lower bound"" of rates as it battles against potentially the biggest economic crash on record and historically low inflation.
A debate over the lower bound, which has consumed various global central banks in recent years, is now raging in Latin America's biggest economy as its rates are pushed to their lowest ever: At what amorphous point do rate cuts turn counterproductive and raise concern over inflation or financial stability?
The central bank's rate-setting committee, known as Copom, reduced its benchmark Selic rate on Wednesday by 75 basis points to 2.25%, and said there may be room for further ""residual"" easing in the coming months.
Its accompanying statement and recent comments from policymakers show a reluctance to go much lower. They cite the potential damaging impact on the exchange rate, inflation expectations, investor confidence and overall financial stability.
But a growing number of analysts say the economic reality will force the hand of central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto, especially given that the institution is failing in its principal objective of meeting its inflation targets. For a country with a history of hyperinflation, this is a rare phenomenon.
(Graphic: Brazil inflation vs target - JP Morgan - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvlwrzopb/INFLATIONJPM.png)
""They will have no choice. Their diagnosis of the crisis is mistaken, thus so is their remedy,"" said Jose Francisco Goncalves, chief economist at Banco Fator in Sao Paulo, faulting the central bank for not grasping the severity of the current downturn.
""The central bank will have to do 'whatever it takes' to support the economy and bring inflation back up to target,"" he said, predicting that the Selic will eventually be cut to 1.5%.
SELIC 1.00%?
A growing band of economists is getting on board with that view. Cassiana Fernandez at JP Morgan sees the Selic ending at 1.75%, and Gustavo Arruda at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and Dev Ashish at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) reckon it will go as low as 1.5%.
Carlos Kawall, director at Asa Bank and a former treasury secretary, believes the Selic will be cut to 1.00%. Were it not for the lower bound debate, it might even be cut to zero.
""We continue to see room for significant additional monetary easing,"" Kawall and his colleagues wrote in a note on Wednesday.
Central to this thinking is inflation, or rather, the lack of it. Annual consumer price inflation in Brazil, where inflation nudged 7,000% only a generation ago, is currently 1.9%, the lowest in over 20 years.
(Graphic: Brazil inflation - annual rate - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovakzdzva/INFLATIONYY.png)
(Graphic: Brazil infllation - monthly rate - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdvxdwkevx/INFLATIONMM.png)
TAYLOR RULE
More importantly, inflation is significantly below the central bank's 2020 goal of 4.0%. And by Copom's own projections, which have fallen consistently in recent meetings, inflation will fail to get back to 4.0% this year or next year's goal of 3.75%.
Using a mix of exchange rate and interest rate variables, Copom on Wednesday estimated that inflation will end this year at 2.0% or 1.9%, down from a projection of 2.4% or 2.3% at last month's meeting. Similarly, the 2021 projections were lowered to 3.0% or 3.2%, from 3.2 or 3.4%. 
With the economy on course to shrink more than 6% this year, according to market consensus, high unemployment and weak demand should continue to put downward pressure on inflation, despite a 25% slide in Brazil's currency against the dollar this year. 
In this context, the ""Taylor Rule,"" an economic model which predicts where interest rates should be to bring inflation to target, points to much a much lower Selic.
(Graphic: Brazil 'Taylor Rule' - BNP Paribas - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprlzdqpe/TAYLORRULE.png)
But the resistance among policymakers is strong. Campos Neto has said the lower bound is difficult to pinpoint and depends on several variables, and there is no consensus in Copom on where that level is.
And unlike central banks in developed economies like the U.S. Federal Reserve or European Central Bank, there is a risk premium attached to Brazil that limits how aggressively Copom can act.
Part of the hesitancy may also be once the lower bound is reached, the next frontier in stimulating the economy and reviving inflation is extraordinary policy measures such as bond-buying, or quantitative easing.
That is a path the central bank is even more reluctant to go down.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada sees the Canadian economy facing a prolonged and uneven recuperation period with households remaining cautious with their spending until there is a coronavirus vaccine, Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri said on Thursday.
Schembri, speaking to a business audience, said the central bank expects Canada's economic recovery to be in two phases: a relatively quick reopening and then a longer recuperation, with the path varying greatly by region. He made no mention of future policy moves.
""The uncertainty around this recuperation stage is extraordinary and points toward a recovery that will be gradual and long-lasting as this uncertainty slowly dissipates,"" Schembri said.
""Cautious spending behaviour on the part of households will likely continue until a vaccine becomes available.""
The Bank of Canada, which slashed its key interest rate three times in March to a record-low 0.25%, is prepared to act to support the financial system and underpin the recovery, the deputy governor reiterated.
Fiscal policy will also be needed to target the specific needs of vulnerable households, sectors and regions, Schembri said.
The speech followed a Tuesday appearance by new Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem, who said the bank remains focused on using its policy tools, including low interest rates, to support the Canada's economic recovery from COVID-19.

The Canadian dollar  maintained its earlier decline, down 0.3% at 1.3610 to the greenback, or 73.48 U.S. cents. Money markets do not expect further rate moves this year. [BOCWATCH]

1041,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>",Trump Farm Bailouts Raise Risks of Reprisals From Trade Partners,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s billions in bailout payments for farmers probably pushed the U.S. past international treaty limits on subsidies, potentially inviting retaliation from trading partners, according to an advocacy group.
The Environmental Working Group, a critic of farm subsidies, calculated that the aid pushed “trade distorting” subsidies covered under a 1994 international agreement to $34 billion in 2019, far above the pact’s $19.1 billion cap for the U.S. The analysis projected the U.S. probably will exceed the cap again in 2020.
The European Union, China and five other World Trade Organization members have already raised complaints that Trump’s farm assistance payments may violate international rules. Brazil, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the EU raised more questions about the assistance payments in advance of a WTO agriculture panel meeting Thursday in Geneva. The U.S. Agriculture Department denies it’s violating the treaty.
“The administration will ensure that all payments are consistent with the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, including obligations capping trade distorting domestic support,” a USDA spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Several independent analysts agreed that the U.S. is likely in violation, though any official action by the WTO might not come for years, if at all. Still, other nations could respond with retaliatory measures on U.S. products or escalate their own farm subsidies, cheapening their exports and lowering global prices.
Breaching the international limits “cuts the legs out” from long-standing U.S. efforts to control other countries’ subsidies of agricultural production, said Jeffrey Schott, a former U.S. Treasury official and trade negotiator in Republican and Democratic administrations who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
“Agriculture subsidies have been a big problem,” Schott said. “We care about it because we have competitive farmers. But if other countries subsidize their farmers that could offset the competitive advantage our farmers have. And that happens from time to time.”
Any sanction through the WTO, long a target of Trump’s complaints about trade, would probably take years, long after a presidential election campaign in which the president is depending on overwhelming support from farmers who benefit from the recent flood of government aid money.
Tension Over Subsidies
But tension over the subsidy payments could spill over into a tit-for-tat trade war between the U.S. and the EU. The EU has pledged to unilaterally retaliate if the U.S. blocks WTO action on any trade dispute by gaming an appeals process the Trump administration has rendered inoperable.
Trump authorized a $28 billion trade bailout over two years for farmers hit by his tariff war with China, more than twice the ultimate cost of the controversial auto industry bailout under former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. The administration also announced a $19 billion coronavirus bailout from money Congress allocated in its relief package and soon will have access to an additional $14 billion in borrowing power lawmakers authorized for the purpose. Farm groups are jockeying for additional aid in the next pandemic relief bill.
Not all of the trade and coronavirus aid counts as “trade-distorting” subsidies under the international rules. And some of the federal government’s regular farm aid program does. The trade rules also have complex procedures for determining which “crop year” to attribute aid payments that don’t align with the federal government’s fiscal year.
As a result, the WTO might count a total lower than the Environmental Working Group’s calculation -- probably between $30 billion and $34 billion for 2019, which still far exceeds the treaty limit, former U.S. Agriculture Department chief economist, Joe Glauber said.
The U.S. probably won’t submit its report on the 2019 payments until 2021, and it may argue that the payments don’t run afoul of the international agreement. It would then be up to another country to submit a complaint demonstrating harm to its producers, opening a sometimes-lengthy dispute process.
“People yell at you, but there isn’t anything automatic that happens when you go over the limit,” said William Reinsch, a former Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration who is now a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Someone could initiate a WTO case. More likely, they’ll give their farmers more money and, if we complain, they’ll say, ‘Well you did it.’”
The U.S. hasn’t previously exceeded the limits on overall farm subsidies since they were established in 1994. But Brazil won a WTO case in 2004 against the U.S. for excessive cotton subsidies and threatened retaliatory measures including actions against U.S. holders of intellectual property rights such as pharmaceutical and entertainment companies. The dispute was ultimately resolved in 2014 after the U.S. agreed to pay financial compensation to Brazilian cotton farmers.
Glauber, the former USDA economist, said whether other countries pursue retaliation this time will probably depend on whether the extra aid continues in future years.
“The big problem with this administration is this isn’t an isolated event,” he said. “You see big payments made in 2018, again in 2019 and now in 2020.”

1043,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 01:30PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Massive spying on users of Google's Chrome shows new security weakness,"By Joseph Menn
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A newly discovered spyware effort attacked users through 32 million downloads of extensions to Google's market-leading Chrome web browser, researchers at Awake Security told Reuters, highlighting the tech industry's failure to protect browsers as they are used more for email, payroll and other sensitive functions.
Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google said it removed more than 70 of the malicious add-ons from its official Chrome Web Store after being alerted by the researchers last month. 
“When we are alerted of extensions in the Web Store that violate our policies, we take action and use those incidents as training material to improve our automated and manual analyses,” Google spokesman Scott Westover told Reuters. 
Most of the free extensions purported to warn users about questionable websites or convert files from one format to another. Instead, they siphoned off browsing history and data that provided credentials for access to internal business tools.
Based on the number of downloads, it was the most far-reaching malicious Chrome store campaign to date, according to Awake co-founder and chief scientist Gary Golomb. 
Google declined to discuss how the latest spyware compared with prior campaigns, the breadth of the damage, or why it did not detect and remove the bad extensions on its own despite past promises to supervise offerings more closely.
It is unclear who was behind the effort to distribute the malware. Awake said the developers supplied fake contact information when they submitted the extensions to Google. 
“Anything that gets you into somebody’s browser or email or other sensitive areas would be a target for national espionage as well as organized crime,” said former National Security Agency engineer Ben Johnson, who founded security companies Carbon Black and Obsidian Security.
The extensions were designed to avoid detection by antivirus companies or security software that evaluates the reputations of web domains, Golomb said.
If someone used the browser to surf the web on a home computer, it would connect to a series of websites and transmit information, the researchers found. Anyone using a corporate network, which would include security services, would not transmit the sensitive information or even reach the malicious versions of the websites.
“This shows how attackers can use extremely simple methods to hide, in this case, thousands of malicious domains,” Golomb said.
After this story's publication, Awake released its research, including the list of domains and extensions. https://awakesecurity.com/blog/the-internets-new-arms-dealers-malicious-domain-registrars
All of the domains in question, more than 15,000 linked to each other in total, were purchased from a small registrar in Israel, Galcomm, known formally as CommuniGal Communication Ltd.
Awake said Galcomm should have known what was happening.
In an email exchange, Galcomm owner Moshe Fogel told Reuters that his company had done nothing wrong.
“Galcomm is not involved, and not in complicity with any malicious activity whatsoever,” Fogel wrote. “You can say exactly the opposite, we cooperate with law enforcement and security bodies to prevent as much as we can.”
Fogel said there was no record of the inquiries Golomb said he made in April and again in May to the company’s email address for reporting abusive behavior, and he asked for a list of suspect domains.
After publication, Fogel said the majority of those domain names were inactive and that he would continue to investigate the others.
The Internet Corp for Assigned Names and Numbers, which oversees registrars, said it had received few complaints about Galcomm over the years, and none about malware.
While deceptive extensions have been a problem for years, they are getting worse. They initially spewed unwanted advertisements, and now are more likely to install additional malicious programs or track where users are and what they are doing for government or commercial spies.
Malicious developers have been using Google’s Chrome Store as a conduit for a long time. After one in 10 submissions was deemed malicious, Google said in 2018 https://blog.chromium.org/2018/10/trustworthy-chrome-extensions-by-default.html it would improve security, in part by increasing human review.
But in February, independent researcher Jamila Kaya and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Systems’ Duo Security uncovered https://duo.com/labs/research/crxcavator-malvertising-2020 a similar Chrome campaign that stole data from about 1.7 million users. Google joined the investigation and found 500 fraudulent extensions.

1044,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 12:55PM ET</span>","Sudan approves plan to liquidate, privatise state firms","KHARTOUM (Reuters) - A Sudanese committee chaired by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok approved a plan on Thursday to liquidate many of the country's 650 state-owned companies and privatise others. 
It is the latest in a series of proposed reforms since Sudan began negotiating a non-funded programme this month with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that could pave the way for international financial support. 
Sudan is also scheduled to discuss potential support with international donors at a conference in Berlin on June 25. 
Under the latest measure, a large number of companies would be liquidated ""because some do absolutely nothing at all, make no profit or have no justification for being owned by the state,"" Adam Harika, an adviser to the prime minister, said in a cabinet statement. 
A government inventory identified 650 companies owned by the state, 431 of which belong to ministries or executive authorities and 200 to defence and the military. 
Only 12 of the companies provided revenue to the finance ministry, Harika said. 
The companies are expected to be put in three categories: continued state ownership, privatisation or no justification for continued existence, the statement said. 
Sudan's economy in a desperate state, with inflation at more than 100% and a currency tumbling as the government prints money to subsidise bread, fuel and electricity.
This week the government approved a plan to further open up the lucrative gold trade to private investors, allowing them to handle all exports and taking the business out of state hands.
It also announced an experimental programme of direct cash transfers to its neediest citizens as it tries to wean itself off costly fuel subsidies.
Until now Sudan has been unable to tap the IMF or World Bank for support as it has $1.3 billion of IMF arrears and is still on a U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, over a year after a popular uprising ousted autocratic leader Omar al-Bashir.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Eskalera, a technology startup led by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) former human resources head Dane Holmes, has launched an index to measure corporate diversity and inclusiveness, the firm said on Thursday.
Eskalera's software collects information on employee sentiment and company culture and combines it with HR data to generate a score for inclusivity that can be measured against competitors. 
The goal is to give companies actionable information on changes needed to increase diversity, said Holmes, Eskalera's chief executive. 
Eskalera is among a group of startups developing software to help corporations hire and retain more diverse staff. Companies that provide some similar services to Eskalera include Visier, Culture Amp and Qualtrics. 
Eskalera, whose clients include  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW), Cornell University and Oscar Health, has seen an uptick in inquiries from prospective clients over the past few weeks, Holmes said.
Many U.S. companies have pledged funds and issued statements in support of racial diversity amid protests that erupted since George Floyd, a black man, died on May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes. 
The gestures by corporate America have drawn some criticism from diversity experts, who say companies should also look at improving racial equity within their ranks. 
""If you don't go down that path, what's going to happen is 49 weeks from now, when it's the one-year anniversary of George Floyd, you're going to have nothing to show in your organization for what you've done,"" Holmes said.
""What you have done to date is pretty easy; you've had to write a note of support and a check.""
Fewer than 1% of Fortune 500 CEOs are black, according to a 2019 study by the Center for Talent Innovation. Around 13% of Americans identify as black or African American, according to federal data.

1046,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 12:09PM ET</span>",U.S. Lawmakers Propose More Coronavirus Relief for Small Businesses,"(Bloomberg) -- Lawmakers rolled out new proposals Thursday to help restaurants and other small businesses still dealing with fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, as a federal relief program is set to end on June 30 with leftover funds and Congress weighs another round of stimulus.
Bipartisan and bicameral legislation was introduced to create a $120 billion bailout fund for small food and beverage establishments, as well as a separate proposal to allow any remaining funds from the Paycheck Protection Program to be used for small firms that need the most help.
The bill introductions come as Congress and the White House are expected to negotiate a potential fourth round of stimulus next month for a U.S. economy still battered by the pandemic, with applications for unemployment benefits last week showing only gradual improvement and millions still out of work. Officials have said the next stimulus measure would include additional aid for small businesses that were left out of earlier rounds or are still trying to re-open and recover.
“Many small businesses will continue to struggle in the weeks and months to come,” said Democratic Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Committee, in a statement. “Congress must once again act urgently to support our most vulnerable small businesses through this crisis, so our economy can recover as quickly as possible after the pandemic.”
PPP Extension
Cardin and Democratic Senators Chris Coons of Delaware and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire introduced the “Prioritized Paycheck Protection Program (P4) Act” that would extend the June 30 deadline to Dec. 30 or longer to apply for a forgivable PPP loan while creating a new option for a second loan for borrowers with 100 employees or fewer that have lost at least half their revenue due to the pandemic. A companion bill is also being introduced in the House.
The PPP, which offers loans of as much as $10 million that can become grants if the proceeds are spent mostly on payroll, is set to expire June 30. As of June 12, the program still had almost $130 billion in funds remaining. Any unused funds would be sent back to the Treasury unless Congress approves another use. The Democrats’ bill would use existing PPP funding to make additional targeted loans.
The Small Business Administration has already approved more than 4.6 million loans totaling more than $513 billion. But lawmakers and groups representing small businesses say firms need more help or were unable to tap relief funding, especially independent contractors, the self-employed and minority-owned and other disadvantaged businesses.
The next phase of assistance for small business is going to be very targeted, particularly at minority firms that are struggling more than white-owned businesses, Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, chairman of the Small Business Committee, said in a video posted on Twitter on Tuesday.
There was a 41% decline of Black business owners from February to April, and the number of Latinx owners declined by 32% during that time compared with a 17% drop for White owners, according to a study released earlier this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
“These disparities can’t stand,” Rubio said. “We have to confront them because what we cannot afford as a nation, especially right now but in general, is an uneven recovery, a recovery that leaves behind people in many cases along the lines of ethnicity and race.”
Revitalization Fund
Meanwhile, Republican Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Democratic Representative Earl Blumenaur of Oregon released a bill with members of the Independent Restaurant Coalition to create a $120 billion “Restaurant Revitalization Fund” in the Treasury Department to provide grants to food service or drinking establishments through Dec. 31.
The trade group for independent U.S. restaurants released a study last week saying a $120 billion industry stabilization fund could generate more than $270 billion in economic activity through savings of as much as $57 billion on government programs for the unemployed, as well as additional sales and payroll taxes, benefits in the supply chain and tourism spending.
The industry, which says it employs 11 million workers directly, has faced millions of job losses during the shutdowns, severe hits to revenue and the likelihood that occupancy restrictions will imperil firms for months more even as the economy reopens.
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said last week the U.S. needs additional fiscal stimulus even as the economy starts to rebound, and that a fourth round of fiscal stimulus should include help for restaurants and travel, retail and leisure businesses, as well as possibly more cash for American families.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell urged Congress on Wednesday not to pull back too quickly on federal relief for households and small businesses from the pandemic.

1047,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 11:55AM ET</span>",Kenya's president says talks on trade deal with U.S. delayed,"By Omar Mohammed
NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya has delayed talks on a trade deal with the United States until a pan-African trade bloc comes into force, President Uhuru Kenyatta said on Thursday, likely holding up what would be Washington's first such pact in sub-Saharan Africa.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Kenyatta agreed in February to start formal talks on a bilateral trade pact that might help offset concerns about China's expanding investment imprint on the continent.
Kenya wants to do a deal with Washington before the expiry of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which allows sub-Saharan African states to export thousands of products to the United States without tariffs or quotas until 2025. 
Kenyatta said Kenya, East Africa's richest economy, had delayed discussions with Washington until the Africa free trade arrangement comes into force, originally set for July 1 but now delayed until later by the coronavirus pandemic.
""When we met with the United States... we made it clear that negotiation would have to be done on the basis of, and without undermining, the Africa free trade arrangement,"" Kenyatta said.
""This works not just for Kenya and Africa, but I also believe it works for the United States, because it gives that wider market access,"" he added during a webinar hosted by the Atlantic Council. 
It was not immediately clear how long the delay to the talks would last. 
Two-way goods trade between the United States and Kenya totalled $1.1 billion in 2019, up 4.9% from 2018.
The African continental free-trade zone, when it comes into effect, would become the largest since the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1994, connecting 1.3 billion people together in a $3.4 trillion economic bloc.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday he hoped to reach a strong free trade agreement with Kenya that could eventually be replicated with other African countries. Negotiations will begin soon, he said.

The Fed’s announcement in March that it would buy corporate bonds was enough to rally credit markets, with many large companies endangered by the pandemic finding enough cash in capital markets to cushion the blow.
More than $1 trillion worth of investment-grade corporate debt sales was brought to the market by the end of May. In a typical year, that figure wouldn’t be reached until around November.
At the same time, it’s not yet clear if small business and states and municipal governments have enough access to low-interest loans, according to a report released Thursday by the Congressional Oversight Commission.
“In some areas of the economy, such as the ability of larger companies to issue debt to continue operations, the agencies’ actions have had a clear and powerful impact,” the report says. “There is less evidence that the actions of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve have been as beneficial for small and mid-sized businesses and state and local governments.”
The report is the second from the bipartisan congressional panel is responsible for overseeing $500 billion in grants and loans from the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve to help struggling businesses, including airlines, during the coronavirus pandemic.

The ECB said it’s taking into account the challenges of relocating during the coronavirus to offices in Frankfurt, Paris and across the European Union. With a year-end deadline for a Brexit trade deal looming, U.S. banks are reactivating plans to expand offices within the EU.
“We have been flexible in order to take into account the restrictions posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, in particular for the relocation of staff,” an ECB spokesperson said in a statement to Bloomberg. While recognizing the difficulties, the ECB said it remains “firm on the need for banks to reach their end-state target operating models.”
The ECB, which supervises the biggest banks in the bloc, has pressed firms to intensify their preparations and abide by deadlines to move. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) have relied on London for their European hubs for years.
Some finance employees who are earmarked to work from Brexit subsidiaries in Europe are still physically in London under European employment contracts as the virus interrupts their plans to move, Bloomberg reported this week.

1050,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 11:50AM ET</span>",IMF says deeper-than-expected contraction in U.S. economy likely in second quarter,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A defacto lockdown in the United States has lasted longer than expected despite a rollback in some restrictions on mobility, pointing to a deeper-than-expected contraction in gross domestic product in the second quarter, the IMF said on Thursday.
Details will be available when the International Monetary Fund releases its updated World Economic Outlook on June 24, spokesman Gerry Rice told a regular briefing held online.
Given the continuing lockdowns, the pace of recovery in the world's largest economy could be slower, he said, without giving an exact forecast.
Rice said the Chinese economy was gaining momentum, with high frequency data showing a stronger-than-expected recovery in investment and services through May. Overall, the balance of risks remained on the downside, he said.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and other top IMF officials have said the Fund is likely to revise downward its already pessimistic forecast for a 3% contraction in global gross domestic output in 2020.
The best-case scenario released by the Fund in April had called for the U.S. economy to contract 5.9% in 2020, with a rebound to 4.7% growth in 2021.
At the time, it forecast China would maintain positive growth of 1.2% in 2020, with growth expanding to 9.2% in 2021.
Rice said the IMF was continuing to provide financing to members through its emergency financing and other facilities. A total of $250 billion of the Fund's $1 trillion in lending capacity had been disbursed so far, he said.
As of Friday, 70 countries will have received some $25 billion in rapid emergency funding that comes largely without the usual IMF conditions, Rice said.
Of that total, about $10 billion went to 28 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, he said, noting that marked a huge increase from the Fund's average annual lending of $1 billion in the region.

1051,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 11:35AM ET</span>",Argentina debt markets rattled as bond revamp talks stall,"By Walter Bianchi and Hugh Bronstein
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine bonds fell nearly 2% on Thursday after restructuring talks with creditors appeared to stall, rattling investors and driving the country's risk spread over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries sharply higher. 
The government unveiled its latest amended proposal late https://www.argentina.gob.ar/sites/default/files/anexo_a17-06-2020.pdf on Wednesday, which a government source said was worth around 50 cents on the dollar, with an additional sweetener linked to the country's farm exports.
That, however, was not enough to win over some bondholders, and a key creditor group said the talks had failed and that it was ""considering all available rights and remedies.""
The government also published two counterproposals https://www.argentina.gob.ar/sites/default/files/joint_proposal_adbg_y_ebg.pdf it had received https://www.argentina.gob.ar/sites/default/files/acc_gramercy_fintech_oaktrees_proposal_.pdf, saying that some creditors demands were ""largely inconsistent"" with its own debt sustainability analysis. 
Argentina aims to revamp about $65 billion in what it has called unsustainable debt.
The ""Ad Hoc"" bondholder group, including names like Fidelity, AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), said in a statement that the Argentine government had ""walked away"" from a counterproposal it had made and had chosen to remain in default.
Amherst Pierpont said in a note that Argentina's latest offer, which it calculated had a maximum net present value of 54.6 cents on the dollar, did not seem all that far away from the toughest demands from the Ad Hoc group, which it put between 47-58 cents.
It said closing the remaining gap would, however, require goodwill on both sides and that the lack of an accord was a potentially worrying sign after weeks of optimism that have boosted Argentina's bond prices.
""This deflates the optimism of a compromise solution and instead increases the risks of legal backlash,"" it added.
Citi said the gap between the two sides looked to be around 5-6 cents, which it said was ""not that large,"" though the main impediment for a deal at this point was ideological.
It pointed to differences in demands over collective action clauses, accrued interest payments and some creditors seeking coupons linked to dollar-denominated GDP rather than exports. That gap could stall talks for now, it added.
""To us, the fact that both parts have made public their positions, means that progress in the negotiations in the next weeks or even months will likely be limited.""
Roberto Geretto, an analyst at local Banco CMF, said a deal was still possible even if there was an important gap.

""The difference is not minimal but it is not insurmountable either, and there are high incentives on both sides to continue negotiating,"" he said, adding that a Friday deadline for accepting a deal would likely be extended.

The central bank also eased some mortgage lending recommendations for banks but said the crisis so far had not hit property prices, although their decline could come in the coming quarters given the economic situation.
The central bank has forecast a sharp 8% contraction in the economy this year, followed by a 4% recovery in 2021, after the global outbreak led to the shutdown of much of the economy for months to stem the spread of the new virus.
The central bank, as part of a financial stability review, said the banking sector remained robust thanks to capital buffers and surpluses.
The bank cut the countercyclical capital buffer rate to 0.5% from 1%, with effect from July, and reiterated it was ready to release the buffer fully if needed.
The Czech Republic was among a handful of European countries that had the buffer in place going into the crisis. It was designed to safeguard the sector against economic swings, growing in good times while falling in worse.
Central bank Governor Jiri Rusnok said the bank was not rushing to cut the buffer to zero yet because banks still had sufficient capital.
The bank also ended a mortgage lending requirement setting a limit on debt-service-to-income levels for borrowers, although it maintained a loan-to-value limit of 90% due to property prices still being overvalued.
It said the overvaluation of apartment prices stood at 15–25% at the end of 2019.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund remains in discussions with Lebanon about possible financing arrangements, an IMF spokesman said on Thursday, adding that it was premature to discuss the scope of any potential program.
Spokesman Gerry Rice declined to give any details on reforms the Fund would require before it would authorize a program, but said the Lebanese government needed to implement comprehensive, equitable reforms in many areas.
He said Lebanon also needed to reach a common understanding about the source and size of the financial losses it faces.
""The discussions are ongoing. These are complex issues that require a common diagnostic of the sources of the losses and the size of the losses in the financial system, as well as on the feasible options to address them in an effective, and equitable manner,"" Rice said during a regular briefing held online.
Lebanon is grappling with an acute financial crisis seen as the biggest threat to its stability since the 1975-90 civil war. Its currency has fallen amid a hard-currency liquidity crunch, which led the state to default on its sovereign debt in March.
The heavily indebted country has been sliding deeper into trouble since October, when a combination of slowing capital inflows and protests against corruption spilled into a political, banking and financial crisis.
Hopes of a quick rescue deal with the IMF have been complicated by a row between the government and central bank over the scale of the losses in the financial system.
Rice's comments made clear that the IMF expects Lebanon to sort out those differences, and to move forward with a broad series of reforms.

""These are complex issues, which require consensus on how to address the difficult challenge in an effective and equitable manner,"" he said. ""Comprehensive reforms in many areas are needed and these require ownership and consensus, from society at large.""

(Reuters) - Retail foot traffic recovered to approach pre-lockdown levels last week and businesses appeared to bring more employees back to the job, according to data from firms that collect cellphone location information and manage employee time for companies.
Broader macroeconomic measures pointed to some improvement as well, with a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' tracker of industrial activity moving higher and the Atlanta Fed's running estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product also increasing from a deep low.
(GRAPHIC - The U.S. reopening - inline: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/yxmvjoxakpr/eikon.png)
Cellphone data from Unacast showed foot traffic at retail locations as of last Saturday was just 10% below the level of a year earlier. Similar foot traffic estimates from Safegraph were over 90% of what they were on March 1, before a national state of emergency was declared and widespread lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.
Data from time management firms Homebase and Kronos both pointed to more employees at work last week from a week earlier.
That's consistent with a steady decline in weekly new unemployment claims, which fell to 1.5 million this week versus 1.56 the week before.
Still, the decline in new filings - 58,000 - was the smallest since early April and far fewer than the 242,000 forecast of economists in a Reuters poll. 
Moreover, some 20.5 million continued to file weekly unemployment claims, a sign of slow progress in the recovery ofthe U.S. labor market.
Measures meant to capture a more general picture of the U.S. economy also point to a patchy recovery. A Goldman Sachs' tracker of industrial activity rose, and is now just 12% below the year-ago level, compared to 20% as of mid-April. By contrast a Goldman measure of consumer activities, weighted towards things like hotel stays and movie ticket sales that may be among the last to recover, remained stalled at -70%.

TBILISI (Reuters) - The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has slashed its 2020 economic forecasts for the South Caucasus countries as they are hit by the spread of the new coronavirus, but projects a recovery in 2021.
Georgia's gross domestic product (GDP) was expected to contract by 5% in 2020, before rebounding to grow around 5% in 2021, the ADB said in its outlook report published on Thursday.
That was down from the 4.9% growth that the bank forecast in September 2019 and 0% projected in April this year.
The Georgian government has also revised its economic outlook forecast to -4% this year from a previous growth projection of 4.5%.
Georgia's economy contracted by 3.6% year-on-year in the first four months of 2020, compared with 4.8% growth in the same period of 2019, as measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus took their toll.
Georgian inflation was projected to slow to 5% in 2020 and 3.5% in 2021, a bit higher than the central bank's 3% target, the ADB said.
The ADB forecasts Armenia's economy would shrink by 3.5% in 2020 and then expand by 3.5% in 2021. The bank's April projection was 2.2% growth for 2020.
The Armenian government expects a contraction of 2%, down from an earlier projection of 4.9% growth.
Inflation was projected at 1.2% in 2020, accelerating to 2.5% next year. Armenia, a country of around 3 million, had registered 18,698 confirmed coronavirus cases and 309 deaths as of Thursday. It is the worst-affected country in the South Caucasus region.
GDP in oil-rich Azerbaijan was expected to contract by 0.1% in 2020, partly due to weaker oil prices, said the ADB, which in September had predicted Azerbaijan's growth would be 2.4% in 2020, but downgraded it in April to 0.5%. 
Inflation was expected to decelerate slightly to 2.8% in 2020, due to sluggish economic activity, and increase to 3.5% in 2021.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank came under pressure from lawmakers on Thursday to escalate its response to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, even as it cut its benchmark interest rate to a two-year low.
Bank Indonesia (BI) delivered its third rate cut this year on Thursday, and said there was scope for more. It has trimmed 175 basis points in an easing cycle since last year to bolster growth.
Said Abdullah, chairman of parliament's budgetary committee, urged BI to fund the government's health and welfare programmes of 397.56 trillion rupiah ($28.38 billion) by buying bonds with a zero coupon as part of the central bank's ""burden sharing"".
""We can't go to the poor and say 'Here is a government programme for you, but please know that it comes with an interest rate from BI',"" Abdullah said during a hearing to discuss the government's 2021 budget.
Planning Minister Suharso Monoarfa, who also attended the hearing, suggested two alternatives: BI buy bonds with yields of 0.1% to 4.5% or bonds with no yield.
""If we see the most basic formula, exports, imports, consumption and investment are down. The only (driver of growth) is government expenditure. If the government is being saddled again with interest payments, I don't think it's fair,"" Monoarfa said. 
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati also told the hearing she hoped BI would make its policy even more accommodative as inflation ""is not a threat for now"". May's inflation rate was the lowest in 20 years.
The suggestions made in the hearing about zero coupon bonds ""would be used in our negotiations with BI"", she said.
""With COVID-19, we are seeing a dramatic increase in the budget deficit that will be a burden for the next 10 years, so the burden sharing with BI is key to managing COVID-19 without increasing the fiscal burden on development programmes,"" she said.
Destry Damayanti, BI's senior deputy governor who was at the hearing, told parliamentarians the suggestions would be discussed in a high-level forum with Indrawati later. 
Governor Perry Warjiyo attended a closed door meeting with parliament's finance commission at the same time, where he was also pressured to agree to buy low-yielding government bonds, two parliament members told Reuters.
The pressure on BI ""to print money"" could ruin investors' trust in Indonesia and lead to inflationary problems later on, said Bhima Yudhistira Adhinegara, an economist with Jakarta-based think-tank the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance.
""Investors will doubt BI's independence especially if it bows to the request for 0% interest rate,"" Adhinegara said.

BI has bought a relatively small amount of government bonds directly in auctions as a non-competitive bidder, with yields determined by the market. It has also bought bonds in the secondary market.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Lloyd's of London insurance market has apologised for its ""shameful"" role in the 18th and 19th Century Atlantic slave trade and pledged to fund opportunities for black and ethnic minority groups.
About 17 million African men, women and children were torn from their homes and shackled into one of the world's most brutal globalised trades between the 15th and 19th centuries. Many died in merciless conditions.
""We are sorry for the role played by the Lloyd’s market in the 18th and 19th Century slave trade - an appalling and shameful period of English history, as well as our own,"" Lloyd's said in a statement on Thursday.
""Recent events have shone a spotlight on the inequality that black people have experienced over many years as a result of systematic and structural racism that has existed in many aspects of society and unleashed difficult conversations that were long overdue,"" it added.
The world's leading commercial insurance market, Lloyd’s - which started life in Edward Lloyd’s coffee house in 1688 - is where complex insurance contracts ranging from catastrophe to events cancellation are agreed and underwritten.
Lloyd's grew to dominate the shipping insurance market, a key element of Europe's global scramble for empire, treasure and slaves, who were usually in the 18th Century included in insurance policies in the general rate for ship cargo.
Weapons and gunpowder from Europe were swapped for African slaves who were shipped across the Atlantic to the Americas.
Those who survived endured a life of subjugation on plantations, while the ships returned to Europe laden with sugar, cotton and tobacco.
Although Britain abolished the trans-Atlantic slave trade in 1807, full abolition did not follow for another generation.
Lloyd's said it would invest in programmes to attract black and minority ethnic talent, review its artefacts to ensure they were not racist and support charities and organisations promoting opportunity for black and minority ethnic people.
'INEXCUSABLE'
A sweeping global reassessment of history and racism has been triggered by the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes while detaining him.
An Oxford University college said on Wednesday it wanted to remove a statue of 19th century colonialist Cecil Rhodes that has been a target of anti-racism protests.
And Greene King, which describes itself as Britain's leading pub owner and brewer, apologised for the profit one of its original founders made from the slave trade.
""It is inexcusable that one of our founders profited from slavery and argued against its abolition in the 1800s,"" Green King's chief executive Nick Mackenzie said.
Green King would make investments to help the black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) community and to support race diversity in its business, Mackenzie added.
The history of several other British financial firms, including  Barclays  (L:BARC) is also under fresh scrutiny.
The bank was named after David Barclay, a Quaker who campaigned actively against slavery in the late 18th century, but it later acquired institutions with links to the slave trade, including Colonial Bank in 1918 and Martins Bank in 1969.

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>",England's high streets half empty despite shops re-opening,"LONDON (Reuters) - England's high streets and shopping centres are still half empty compared to last year, despite the easing of lockdown rules which has allowed all stores to re-open, showing the challenge faced by the government to get the economy moving again. 
After 83 days of coronavirus lockdown, non-essential stores in England were permitted to open on Monday, but data from market researcher Springboard found much lower shopper numbers, or footfall.
Getting shoppers spending again is key to Britain's recovery after official data on Friday showed the economy shrank by a quarter over March and April.
In the first two days of this week, footfall in English high streets remained down over 50% compared to the same days last year, in a sign that shoppers remain cautious despite forecasts that pent-up demand would get tills ringing again.
Shopping centres in England fared a little better, with footfall down 43% on Monday, but worsening on Tuesday to be down by half.
One brighter spot was retail parks, whose footfall was only down by 14% on Monday, before falling to be down by 20% on Tuesday. 
With plenty of car parking, retail parks may find it easier to attract shoppers in cars, while other shopping destinations face accessibility issues due to ongoing restrictions on public transport usage by those who are not key-workers. 

The easing of lockdown rules varies in different parts of Britain. While all shops in England were allowed to open on 15 June, Scotland's shops will not re-open until 29 June.

Tyrie, a former senior UK lawmaker, said he had helped to make proposals for wide-ranging changes at the CMA last year, and now wants to make the case ""more forcefully"" for the reforms in parliament and beyond, which would not be possible as chair of the watchdog.
""On taking the role, I was asked by the Government to map out a route to a new type of competition authority, one better equipped to understand and respond to what most concerns ordinary consumers,"" he said.
""And in our response to the coronavirus outbreak, we’ve reoriented the organisation to listen and act on consumer concerns more quickly and effectively.""
The watchdog is set to play a bigger role from the end of the year due to the country's departure from the European Union, ending Brussels' jurisdiction over big mergers and antitrust issues in Britain.
Tyrie became a member of parliament's House of Lords after standing down as an elected member of the lower chamber where he made a name for himself by forensically quizzing central bankers and regulators as chair of the influential Treasury Select Committee.
In the past he has been touted as a potential chief of Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, which is currently waiting for the government to appoint a permanent chief executive.
Britain's business ministry will recruit a new chair for the CMA.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England increased its bond-buying programme by a further 100 billion pounds ($125 billion) on Thursday to help steer the economy away from its record coronavirus slump, but sharply slowed the pace of its purchases.
The BoE kept its key interest rate at 0.1% and there was no discussion in the policymakers' minutes of taking it below zero - an option that Governor Andrew Bailey and other officials have said is possible in the future.
Eight members of the nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee voted to increase the bond purchase programme, while BoE Chief Economist Andy Haldane voted against an increase.
All nine members voted to keep Bank Rate unchanged.
The central bank said it would spend all the extra 100 billion on government bonds but would slow the pace of its purchases, saying it expected the new total 745 billion-pound target would be hit around the turn of the year.
That represented a much slower pace than its rush to buy gilts since the coronavirus pandemic escalated in March.
The BoE said recent payment data and other up-to-date signals from the economy suggested consumer spending could already have reached a level that it previously expected would only be reached by the third quarter.
But there were risks that a rise in unemployment could be worse than it had thought.
Sterling rose and British government bond yields touched their highest since June 10 after the decision, before easing back a little. The 2-year gilt yield briefly turned positive for the first time in more than a week.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 100 billion-pound increase in the asset purchase programme and Bank Rate remaining at 0.1%.
But some economists had predicted a bigger increase to the asset purchase programme and possibly a clearer signal that negative rates were under consideration.
""Despite its recent flirting with negative policy rates, we think it is quite unlikely the Bank will go down this path,"" Luke Bartholomew, an investment strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said.
The BoE is using its bond-buying programme as its main policy tool as it tries to help steer Britain's economy away from a record 25% slump in March and April.
By soaking up much of the surge in borrowing by the government - which has ramped up spending to tackle the COVID-19 hit to the economy - the BoE is keeping a lid on borrowing costs paid by businesses and consumers as well as the state.
The BoE also says that pumping more stimulus into the economy will help it meet its 2% inflation target. Data on Wednesday showed annual inflation of just 0.5% in May.

""As partial lifting of the measures takes place, we see signs of some activity returning,"" Bailey said after the BoE announced a 100 billion pound ($124 billion) increase in the size of its bond-buying programme but slowed the pace of purchases sharply.
""We don't want to get too carried away by this. Let's be clear, we're still living in very unusual times.""
Bailey told reporters that the BoE's plan to stretch its now 745 billion-pound bond-buying programme until around the turn of the year was still faster than anything done by the British central bank prior to the coronavirus crisis.
""We're slowing from ... warp speed to something that by any historical standards still looks fast,"" he said.
Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said the BoE now estimated that Britain's economy was heading for a roughly 20% contraction over the first and second quarters of 2020, compared with a fall of about 27% included in a scenario it published last month.
Broadbent said negative news from Britain's labour market was probably more significant for the inflation outlook - which is central to the BoE's mandate - than then pick-up in activity.

On negative interest rates, Bailey repeated previous comments that they were an option for the BoE, but that the issue was complex and taking borrowing costs below zero was not in any way imminent.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India plans to impose higher trade barriers and raise import duties on around 300 products from China and elsewhere, two government officials said, as part of an effort to protect domestic businesses.
The plan has been under review since at least April, according to a government document seen by Reuters, and is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recently announced self-reliance campaign to promote local products.
The new duty structures are likely to be gradually outlined over the next three months, said the sources, who asked not to be named as the plan is still being finalised.
India's finance ministry and trade ministry, which is involved in the discussions, did not respond to requests for comment.
The government is considering raising import duties on 160-200 products and imposing non-tariff barriers - such as licensing requirements or stricter quality checks - on another 100, according to the officials.
The decision will target imports worth $8-10 billion with the aim of deterring non-essential lower quality imports which render Indian products uncompetitive, said the first official, who has direct knowledge of the plans.
""We are not targeting any country, but this is one of the ways to reduce a trade deficit that is lopsided with countries like China,"" the second official said.
Bilateral trade between China and India was worth $88 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2019, with a trade deficit of $53.5 billion in China's favour, the widest India has with any country. 
Between April 2019 and February 2020, the latest data available, India's trade deficit with China was $46.8 billion.
A separate industry source familiar with the matter said engineering goods, electronics and some medical equipment were among items being considered under the plan. A third government source said non-tariff barriers, such as more stringent quality control certification, could apply to imported products such as air conditioners.
Modi has vowed to promote and protect local manufacturing since he swept to power in 2014. He has promoted a ""Make in India"" programme in recent years, and last month announced an ""Atmanirbhar Bharat"", or a self-reliant India, campaign.
India already raised taxes on imports of goods such as electronic items, toys and furniture in February, drawing criticism that it was a protectionist move against foreign businesses. Sweden's IKEA, for example, said at the time it was disappointed with the higher tariffs.
The government document showed feedback had been sought from various Indian ministries to arrive at the list of around 300 products, which has not been seen by Reuters. 
India has increased duties on more than 3,600 tariff lines covering products from sectors such as textiles and electronics since 2014, the document added.

""We're pushing for a policy to strengthen Indian manufacturing keeping in view its strengthens and weaknesses,"" a fourth government official said.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina farmers have objected to the government's proposal to tie the interest rate of bonds issued in the country's debt restructuring to the country's agricultural exports.
The proposal was included in the government's most recent offer to the holders of about $65 billion in sovereign bonds as a sweetener to get a deal done.
But the warrants, which would trigger payments whenever farm exports hit a certain threshold, were not enough to win over bondholders. The government on Wednesday called a time out to regroup in the final stretch of the restructuring talks.
""The creditors saw the warrants as a perk but not as a bargaining tool strong enough to bridge the gap,"" said a source familial with the discussions, who asked not to be named.
Growers, for their part, worry that the warrants would be an incentive for the government to keep export taxes unchanged at current levels of 33% for soybeans and soy-based products, and 12% for corn and wheat. Argentina is a major international supplier of all three crops.
""The use of export tax warrants by a government that regulates exports and export taxes sounds fishy,"" said David Hughes, a grower in the bread-basket province of Buenos Aires.
Argentina's main farm groups sent a letter to the government saying its members were ""alarmed"" at the idea of tying bond interest rates to exports.
""Such a financial instrument would generate negative incentives for agricultural production,"" the letter said.
""It would mean that export taxes would not be lowered until the bonds mature ... compromising our capacity to generate employment, investment and economic reactivation,"" it said.
Argentina's economy, hit by a lockdown called on March 20 to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, is expected by economists to shrink by about 9.5% this year.

PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union said on Thursday it could impose taxes on digital giants such as Google (O:GOOG), Amazon (O:AMZN) and Facebook (O:FB) even without a global agreement by the year-end, after Washington quit talks and stoked fears of a new trade war.
The latest transatlantic row was ignited when the United States said on Wednesday it was withdrawing from negotiations with European countries over new international tax rules on digital firms, saying talks had made no progress.
Nearly 140 countries are involved in the talks organised by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on the first major rewrite of global tax rules in a generation to bring them up to date for the digital era.
""A trade war, especially at this point in time, where the world economy is going through a historical downturn, would hurt the economy, jobs and confidence even further,"" OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria said, urging all sides to reach a deal.
The talks aim to reach agreement by the end of 2020, but that deadline is now slipping out of reach with Washington's latest move and the U.S. presidential election in November.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said France, Britain, Italy and Spain had jointly responded on Thursday to a letter from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announcing the pullout.
""This letter is a provocation. It's a provocation towards all the partners at the OECD when we were centimetres away from a deal on the taxation of digital giants,"" Le Maire told France Inter radio.
Spain's government said it and other European nations would not accept ""any type of threat from another country"" over the digital tax. Italy said it was committed to a global deal.
European countries says tech firms pay too little tax in countries where they do business because they can shift profits around the globe. Washington has resisted new unilateral taxes on Silicon Valley companies in the absence of an OECD deal.
CHAMPAGNE AND HANDBAGS
""The European Commission wants a global solution to bring corporate taxation into the 21st century,"" European Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said.
""But if that proves impossible this year, we have been clear that we will come forward with a new proposal at EU level,"" he said, saying taxes could be introduced even without a deal.
France, one of several European countries which has enacted new taxes, had agreed to suspend collection of its levy while talks were under way on a global approach.
Le Maire said France would impose its digital services tax this year, whether or not Washington returned to negotiations.
""No one can accept that the digital giants can make profits from their 450 million European clients and not pay taxes where they are,"" he said.
The French tax applies a 3% levy on revenue from digital services earned in France by companies with revenues of more than 25 million euros ($28 million) in France and 750 million euros worldwide. 
Washington has threatened to impose trade tariffs on French Champagne, handbags and other goods in response.
The United States opened trade investigations this month into digital taxes in Britain, Italy, Spain and other countries over concerns that they unfairly target U.S. companies.
President Donald Trump threatened this month to impose tariffs on EU cars if the bloc did not drop its tariff on American lobsters. 
Efforts to reach even a limited U.S.-EU trade deal have foundered and sources on both sides see little chance of progress with a U.S. presidential election barely four months away.

A finance ministry spokesperson in Britain, which is seeking trade deals with Brussels and Washington after it left the EU, said that London's ""preference is for a global solution to the tax challenges posed by digitalisation.""

The EU hit Russia's energy, financial and arms sectors after Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and went on to back rebels fighting Kyiv government troops in the east of the ex-Soviet republic.
It has rolled them over ever since as Moscow has vowed to never give back the Black Sea peninsula. 
The curbs are now in place until the end of July, and the 27 national EU leaders holding a virtual meeting on Friday are expected to pave the way for another six-month extension, which would be formalised later this month, the sources said. 
Separately on Thursday, the EU prolonged its ban on doing business with the annexed Crimea until mid-2021. A third batch of EU sanctions blacklists people and firms the bloc sees as instrumental in spreading havoc in the former Russian satellite.
While some countries including Italy and Hungary would want to see a revival of economic ties with Russia, the bloc's dovish wing has not had the upper hand recently as the EU was unnerved by what it has seen as Moscow's disinformation over coronavirus.
Moscow last month denied hacking the German parliament and, on Thursday, German federal prosecutors accused Russia of ordering a killing in Berlin last summer, allegations that further weigh on plan by EU leaders including European Council President Charles Michel for cautious re-engagement with Moscow.

U.S. President Donald Trump has also recently called for Russia to be allowed back into the G7 club of leading economies, a seat Moscow lost over the conflict in Ukraine.

“You can count on us to be forcible and systematic in implementing the deal, and in doing so certainly protecting the single market,” Joao Vale de Almeida, the EU’s ambassador to the U.K., said on a Chatham House webinar on Thursday, when asked if the bloc would mirror Britain’s stance. “We took note of the British decision, but we are not at the point in time where we either need or wish to take decisions on our side.”
Even if the U.K. and EU agree a free-trade agreement this year, replacing Britain’s decades-long membership of the bloc, companies will have to handle a wave of new paperwork and administrative costs. Goods crossing the U.K.-EU border will require customs declarations and products of animal origin will need health certificates. Without the right documents, there is the risk of border disruption and goods being held up at ports.
“I don’t think everybody has fully grasped this new reality,” de Almeida said. “We have to raise the awareness about the implications of this, with deal or no-deal.”
The U.K. is planning a ‘shock and awe’ information campaign from July onwards to encourage businesses to make preparations. Last week, the British government said it would initially relax the customs requirements on imports from the EU when the Brexit transition period finishes at the end of this year to help companies manage the new burden.

The Chamber said the pandemic had clearly slowed progress for both governments, but there were reasons to be hopeful. It also welcomed regular talks between the world's two largest economies on implementation of purchases, intellectual property reforms and other issues covered by the trade deal.
“Implementation is critical. COVID-19 has unquestionably slowed progress for both governments, and it will be critical for the pace of implementation of purchases to accelerate markedly,"" it said in a statement after a virtual meeting of top U.S. and Chinese business leaders on Wednesday.
The meeting, one of two convened each year by the Chamber and the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, a Beijing-based think tank, focused on the Phase 1 trade deal that took effect in February, and supply chain challenges.
Tensions between the two countries have spiked in recent months, sparking questions about the future of the trade deal, under which China agreed to buy $200 billion more in U.S. goods and services over two years.
China threatened retaliation after U.S. President Donald Trump signed legislation on Wednesday calling for sanctions over the repression of China's Uighurs, a Muslim minority.
The Chamber said China’s 1.4 billion consumers represented the fastest growing market for U.S. companies, but U.S. firms also faced myriad challenges doing business with China.

Under emergency measures brought in on March 23 for six months, the government has been providing financial support to rail companies to keep trains running for key workers despite overall passenger numbers plunging by as much as 96%.
The government has approved 3.5 billion pounds of spending to ensure rail services continue to operate and it was not yet possible to provide an estimate of the total cost incurred to date, junior transport minister Chris Heaton-Harris said in a written parliamentary answer.
The final bill could rise as industry sources say rail companies are asking for government help to stretch beyond the initial six months as passenger numbers are unlikely to return to previous levels for some time.
Britain's railways, which were privatised in the 1990s, are currently running with passenger numbers down by 80% to 90% from normal levels. As long as the country's two metre social distancing rule remains in place, they can only carry about 15% of their usual capacity.
Britain is reviewing its two-metre social distancing rule ahead of the next stage of lockdown easing planned for July 4, and should it be reduced to one metre, trains could run at about 45% full according to industry estimates.
Under the emergency measures, the government took on all the cost and revenue risk itself, and instead paid companies including FirstGroup (L:FGP), Arriva UK Trains and Govia, partly owned by Go-Ahead (L:GOG) a small fee to keep operating services.
The previous model of rail contracts, where operators need to grow passenger numbers to meet their financial commitments, was already under pressure before the pandemic, and will face further challenges under social distancing.

LONDON (Reuters) - The rising significance of non-banks has increased the speed and scope of stress transmission through the global financial system at a time when the importance of the U.S. dollar has grown, the Bank for International Settlements said.
The umbrella group for the world's central banks said the structural shifts in favour of these players such as pension funds and insurers has increased market complexity and highlighted the need to gather more data on their activities.
""In order to preserve the benefits from a global funding market based in U.S. dollars we will need to make sure that the intermediation chain is robust,"" said Philip Lowe, chairman of a central bank forum for monitoring the broad financial system and the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia.
""We have made progress with banks after the global financial crisis but we do not have enough transparency on the activity of non-banks.""
Dollar borrowing costs spiked in March to levels last seen during the 2007-2008 financial crisis as a global rush to secure funding ramped up the pressure on global portfolios held by these non-banks.
The dollar has returned to the dominant position it held around the turn of the century, gaining share in international funding and accounting for 61% of official foreign exchange reserves.
And though dollar funding activity has declined in Europe, trading has risen in the rest of the world, especially within emerging markets, the BIS said. Moreover, non-banks have increasingly taken on the mantle that banks once held in intermediating in the vast but opaque dollar funding markets.
But unlike banks, non-banks have lesser access to reliable sources of U.S. dollar funding such as central bank discount windows and therefore should they experience distress, this could trigger fire sales that could amplify any market volatility, the BIS said.
And with global economies increasingly interconnected, shocks in one market could be transmitted with large effects on the global financial system, affecting the cost and availability of U.S. dollar financing.
The BIS said authorities around the world should seek to improve the transparency of global U.S. dollar funding activities through additional data collection, greater data sharing and improved disclosure.
They should also consider improving the collection of data on the involvement of non-banks' institutions and the increasingly important role played by them around key markets such as the repo and FX swap markets.

GUANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - The coronavirus has disrupted supply chains and demand across the global economy, but it is the prospect of Europe becoming a casualty in the U.S.-China tech war that keeps the president of the European Chamber in China ""awake at night"".
""When two elephants dance it's hard to stand aside and not be impacted,"" said Jörg Wuttke, who is also the chief representative in China of German petrochemicals giant BASF.
China is starting to recover from the coronavirus that was first identified in the central city of Wuhan in December before spreading across the world, infecting more than 8.3 million people. Fears of a second wave have grown after an outbreak in Beijing last week.
But the coronavirus is ""one challenge that I think can be handled"", Wuttke said over a video-link from his home in Beijing. 
He was due to attend the launch of a confidence survey from the chamber's south China chapter in Guangzhou, but stayed away due to the re-emergence of coronavirus in the capital. 
European firms are currently ""navigating in the dark"", due to the uncertainty brought by the virus, Wuttke said.
But he nevertheless sees getting caught in the crossfire between the United States and China as a longer-term threat. 
""When it comes to the kind of U.S.-China trade war, the tech war which is unfolding, the possibility of a finance war, it's something which is going to be longer lasting, it's going to be more damaging, and it's definitely going to bring huge uncertainty,"" he said.
""We have a complete reliance on American semiconductors, as does China,"" he said. ""We also have a huge market here (in China).
""The ultimate worry of course is if then the U.S. or China turn to us and then say 'will you please make a choice - are you going with us or against us?""
The United States placed Huawei China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd  on a trade blacklist in May 2019, citing national security concerns, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Wednesday those concerns remain, especially over 5G.
The move effectively banned U.S. firms from doing business with the world's largest telecom network gear maker and escalated a trade battle between the world's two biggest economies.
Wuttke said that despite years of lobbying, European businesses continue to face an unfair playing field in China, also in emerging tech fields like 5G.
""Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) in snatching up orders (in the Middle East) and Africa and Asia, and, of course, in Europe it is competing with Huawei head on,"" he said.
""But they can’t really compete here, which of course gives you a very, very big disadvantage, because China is 50% of the possible 5G market.""
The south China business confidence survey found little appetite for its members to leave the region, where they enjoy close access to manufacturing supply chains, with 88% saying they had no plans to relocate in the next three years.
Yet the wider chamber's confidence survey also found that 44% of respondents expect the regulatory environment to worsen in the next five years. 
Wuttke explained the apparent contradiction was down to companies remaining confident of the growth opportunities in China, which his company expects to account for 30% of global growth over the next decade by a conservative estimate.
""We want to be part of that show, we want to be part of that growth model,"" he said.

South China also continues to offer the best environment for foreign companies to operate in, explained George Lau, the chamber's vice president and the general manager of TÜV Rheinland, a certification company.

Investing.com -- Initial jobless claims are set to slow further from their eye-watering pandemic peak, while continuing claims are expected to dip below 20 million for the first time since April. The ECB gets a vote of confidence from banks as they take advantage of its cheapest-ever loan, while the Bank of England is expected to increase its bond-buying program later. Stocks are set to open mixed amid concerns over a new wave of virus infections and the threat of trade tension with the EU, while President Trump called John Bolton a liar after the former National Security Advisor depicted him as a re-election-obsessed supplicant to Xi Jinping. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, June 18th.
1. Jobless claims set to continue falling
The latest weekly set of jobless claims is set to be published at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), at a time when a rise in new Covid-19 infections is raising fears of another wave of job-killing lockdown measures.
Analysts expect initial claims to fall to 1.30 million last week, which would be the lowest since the first lockdowns started to bite in late March, and down from 1.54 million the previous week. Continuing claims, which indirectly reflect the speed at which people are being rehired, are expected to dip below 20 million for the first time since April, at 19.80 million.
The numbers will be released simultaneously with the Philadelphia Fed’s regional business survey. The New York Fed’s Empire State survey earlier this week showed a stronger-than-expected rebound in manufacturing activity.
2. Banks vindicate ECB's rate cut with biggest-ever liquidity operation
The European Central Bank carried out its biggest ever single injection of liquidity into the eurozone’s money markets, in an apparent vindication of its move to push interest rates still further into negative territory last month.
Banks borrowed 1.308 trillion ($1.47 trillion) from the ECB’s latest Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operation, or TLTRO, the first to offer a rate as low as -1% for banks that meet the ECB’s lending criteria (which means nearly all of them).  After netting out money that is being shifted from other outstanding ECB loans this week, it still adds up to a liquidity injection of 548 billion euros.  
The high demand implies that the lower rate isn’t as destructive as some had feared with regard to bank profitability. Pictet Wealth Management economist Frederik Ducrozet said it will result in a net transfer of 15 billion euros to the participating banks. The euro was little changed at $1.1248, while sovereign bond spreads tightened modestly.
3. Stocks set to open mixed
U.S. stocks are set to open mixed, as concerns about the coronavirus and an increase in political noise undermine confidence in a V-shaped economic recovery.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 futures contract was down 31 points, or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 0.1% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up less than 0.1%.
Stocks in focus on Thursday will include T-Mobile, which predicted a healthy rise in customers this year after the closing bell on Wednesday. That should offset concerns about higher-than-expected one-off costs from its merger with Sprint, and a bigger-than-expected hit from Covid-19 related provisions.
Big tech will also be in focus after the U.S. effectively pulled out of international talks on a new framework for taxing multinational companies. That makes the imposition of digital services taxes in key markets in Europe likelier – as well as a U.S. response in the form of fresh import tariffs.
4. Bank of England expected to increase QE
The Bank of England is expected to ramp up its monetary support for the U.K. economy at its Monetary Policy Committee meeting.
Analysts expect the BoE to increase its asset purchase program by at least another 100 billion pounds, given that the current pace of bond-buying will exhaust it by September.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned last week that the U.K. economy will shrink by the most of any in the G7 this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The country was slow to impose lockdown and social distancing requirements and its economy has a disproportionately high exposure to services, which have suffered more than manufacturing in the downturn.
The pound drifted down 0.6% to a two-week low against the dollar at $1.2485, and also slid to its lowest against the euro since late March.
Elsewhere, the Swiss and Norwegian central banks kept their key rates unchanged, while Indonesia's cut again.
5. Trump brands Bolton a liar after claims of weakness in front of Xi
Former National Security Advisor John Bolton denounced President Donald Trump in widely-trailed excerpt from his soon-to-be-published memoir.
Bolton said Trump had sought the help of President Xi Jinping in getting re-elected in 2020 by engineering a trade deal that he could present as a triumph, and had repeatedly made concessions to Xi despite long-standing U.S. concerns about Chinese intellectual property theft, currency manipulation and human rights observations (Bolton noted on the latter that Trump privately endorsed the establishment of concentration camps for China’s Muslim minority in its western Xinjiang province).
Trump, whose first two years in office were overshadowed by evidence of his soliciting Russian help in the 2016 election campaign, responded by calling Bolton a liar.
Bolton also criticised the Democratic Party for not broadening its efforts to have Trump impeached for abuse of office. Bolton declined to testify at the impeachment hearings last year, preferring to save his revelations for his publishers."
1076,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",Banks borrow record 1.31 trillion euros from ECB,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone banks borrowed a record 1.31 trillion euros ($1.47 trillion) from the European Central Bank on Thursday, taking advantage of negative interest rates to meet growing demand for credit from companies hit by the deepest recession in living memory. 
Launched six years ago, the ECB's targeted-longer term refinancing operations (TLTROs) were redesigned earlier this year to help the economy cope with the coronavirus crisis and banks will get the cash for a rate as low as minus 1%.
At 1.31 trillion euros, take up is above expectations with most analysts predicting a figure just over 1 trillion euros for the three-year loans. Forecasts were generally in the 900 billion to 1.4 trillion euro range. 
Although borrowing was more than twice as big as in any previous ECB facility, the net take is smaller as banks likely rolled over around 750 billion euros worth of earlier ECB funding to take advantage of record low rates.
The negative interest rate means banks that tapped the auction will earn 0.50% for one year with no strings attached and 1% if they simply refrain from shrinking their loan book.
The interest rates for the remainder of the loan's duration will be as low as the ECB's deposit facility, currently minus 0.5%.
The take-up increases the ECB's balance sheet and bolsters its hopes that banks will continue to lend even as the economy shrinks by almost a tenth, helping firms survive until Europe is ready to fully reopen after the crisis.
Companies drew down their credit lines at the start of the pandemic. This is in sharp contrast with the bloc's financial and debt crises a decade ago, when banks withheld credit to protect their balance sheets, exacerbating the downturn. 

The ECB, which also supervises the bloc's biggest banks, has now allowed lenders to run down their buffers without penalties, also in the hope they inducing lending.

1077,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>",Polish finance minister says zloty currency currently too weak,"By Anna Koper
WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish Finance Minister Tadeusz Koscinski said on Thursday the zloty is currently too weak, sending the currency higher.
Koscinski spoke after the Polish central bank signalled it would have preferred the zloty to be weaker during the coronavirus pandemic to support economic recovery.
""They conduct monetary policy, we conduct fiscal policy,"" Koscinski said, when asked by a reporter whether there was a difference of opinion between him and the central bank about the zloty. ""For me, the exchange rate is a bit too weak.""
The zloty (EURPLN=) firmed after the comments and at 0908 GMT was 0.28% stronger on the day.
""After the finance minister's comments that the zloty is still too weak, the euro/zloty went from 4.46 to 4.45... The market is looking for reasons to buy zloty I guess,"" said a Warsaw-based currency trader.
Koscinski also said Poland plans to issue bonds on the domestic and foreign markets after the 2020 budget is amended.

""We already have 100% of our borrowing needs in line with the current budget...Ahead of us is the budget amendment and then we will see what the needs will be and then we will go out to the domestic and foreign market.""

1078,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>",Sharp learning curve for bosses as WFH goes global,"By Mark John
LONDON (Reuters) - Two weeks into the coronavirus lockdown and Sergei Holmeckis, a boss at Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY)'s Czech operations in the city of Brno, was frustrated with staff video calls. His team didn't like turning on their cameras and the discussion was stilted.
""I started to show them my cat,"" Holmeckis said. ""It showed the human side of me more and really changed the perception. It got people to switch on their cameras and be more engaged.""
Such tactics obviously won't appeal to everyone. But they do show how the world's biggest experiment in working from home is forcing managers to reassess their methods - especially as surveys predict higher levels of remote working post-pandemic.
Before the new coronavirus began spreading, just 2.9% of the world's employees were working exclusively or mainly from home, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO), a Geneva-based UN agency.
Within weeks, that figure exploded as social distancing forced companies to launch telework schemes. An Argentinian study found that 93% of large firms had turned to telework; in Britain, half of all employers said that by late-April the bulk of their staff were working from home.
The exercise was often chaotic, with scant regard for what tasks could be performed at home. Many workers faced cramped living spaces or had to juggle the job with children grounded by school closures. Others felt isolated.
Yet overall reactions have been broadly positive. Surveys in the United States and Britain have shown over three-quarters of companies expect to offer more homeworking after the pandemic, with staff citing benefits such as greater work-life balance and claiming they felt just as productive as in the office.
Twitter was among the first to declare that working from home would be a permanent option, while the head of  Barclays  (LON:BARC) bank suggested that ""putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past"".
""This is a revolution here and we don't know what the end-result will be,"" said Jon Messenger, an ILO expert on working conditions who has traced the history of telework since it first emerged in the mid-1970s with the label ""telecommuting"".
""Managers in the past have been very unwilling to do this because of the loss of direct control over subordinates ... it requires a totally different approach to management.""
TRUST THE WORKER
Messenger argues the new approach implies above all a shift towards greater results-based performance appraisal while allowing employees more scope to organise their work time.
But while various studies link so-called ""time sovereignty"" to productivity benefits, some companies find that hard to take on board. Developers of employee tracking software - which for example send managers screenshots of their staff's computer screens - are currently reporting a surge in sales.
Companies where tasks are hard to quantify argue that some form of monitoring is essential. But workplace experts warn that excessive surveillance can be counterproductive.
""Employers risk damaging the relationship if they are treating staff like children,"" Ben Willmott, head of public policy for the CIPD body of human resources professionals.
The rise over the past decade of collaborative software has made teamwork from separate locations easier, weakening the argument made in 2013 by former Yahoo! (NASDAQ:AABA) boss Marissa Mayer that teleworkers were seen as a ""drag"" on office-based colleagues. 
But such tools still leave many employees with a sense of disconnect and lack of structure in their working lives. Just as Deutsche Telekom's Holmeckis did by using his cat as an ice-breaker, managers will have to learn how to bridge the distance.
""There is a risk of people disengaging. A lot of the conversations are operational, about tasks: low on empathy, low on personal support,"" said Octavius Black, whose company Mind Gym offers workshops on remote management skills.
For now, the world is not far enough into the mass telework experiment to know how it will change work patterns or even what the real impact has already been on productivity. 
It is also unlikely to be representative of how companies and employees will use telework when the health crisis abates.
Assuming that lockdowns do not have to be reimposed to prevent a second wave of the virus, ILO's Messenger suggests that telework will become more widespread but in a watered-down form - optional and not for the entire working week.
""The sweet spot is about two or three days a week,"" he said. ""Then you won't have so many of the downsides.""

1079,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>",Germany wants to bolster EU shaken by pandemic: Merkel,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has exposed the weakness of the European Union and Germany will use its presidency of the bloc to promote solidarity and economic prosperity among its 27 member states, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday.
In a speech to parliament, Merkel said the most immediate challenge facing the bloc reeling from more than 100,000 deaths linked to COVID-19 and facing its worst recession since World War Two was to agree on a multi-year budget and a recovery fund.
""The pandemic has revealed how fragile the European project still is,"" said Merkel, lamenting the ""rather national and not European"" initial response to the pandemic by EU governments, including her own. ""Cohesion and solidarity have never been more important than today.""
Germany takes over the EU presidency for six months on July 1 and Merkel said member states have high expectations of the bloc's largest economy, which is also its paymaster.
EU leaders will debate the European Commission's 750 billion euro ($842.93 billion) recovery plan for the first time on Friday, together with a 1.1 trillion euro proposal for the next EU budget for 2021-2027. The plan will need the approval of all member states.
Merkel said she expects an agreement on the spending plans at a physical meeting of EU leaders later this year, playing down the chances of a breakthrough at a videoconference summit on Friday.
""I will make the case that at the European Council we reach a decision about a multi-year financing deal and a recovery fund as quickly as possible,"" said Merkel.
The pandemic struck the bloc as it was struggling with other major challenges like finding a common strategy to counter China's stellar economic rise, dealing with a hostile U.S. administration and achieving technological and military sovereignty.
Merkel touched on some of those issues as she set out her objectives for Germany's EU presidency. She urged the EU to speak with one voice to China and take on more global responsibility especially by promoting democracy and human rights.

1080,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 03:35AM ET</span>",Swiss watchmakers fear job cuts as coronavirus crisis hits sales,"By Silke Koltrowitz
ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss watchmakers expect fallout from the coronavirus pandemic will have a lasting impact on demand for watches, which could mean job cuts later in the year, industry representatives told Reuters.
Swiss watch exports plunged 68% in May, as COVID-related store closures led to a sales collapse in major markets, along with the impact of protests in the United States and Hong Kong.
The Swiss Watch Federation described May as a ""second month of quasi-paralysis"" in a statement on Thursday. Exports in April were down 81%.
Francois-Henry Bennahmias, chief executive of high-end watch brand Audemars Piguet said: ""It's not that nobody wants to buy watches anymore, but in the after-COVID era many people will consume less, they will be more selective.""
He told Reuters he was most worried about the United States, the biggest market for Audemars, one of the last remaining independent Swiss watch brands. Bennahmias said he expected sales in general to fall by up to 25% this year, below the 1 billion Swiss franc ($1.05 billion) mark achieved last year.
Joris Engisch, head of watchmaker Singer, said the industry was just beginning to feel the pain. ""Half of all the watches we sell go to Chinese customers and they won't start travelling again soon,"" he said.
""We have not had a single new order in three months. We'll have to shut down completely for several weeks this summer,"" he said, adding that smaller subcontractors with lower margins would struggle even more.
""I'm optimistic for the long term, but quite pessimistic for the end of the year, we'll have one or even two extremely difficult years,"" he said. ""Companies will start laying off staff if they don't see positive signals after the summer.""
Raphael Thiemard, who looks after the watch industry at Swiss union Unia, said he expected to see job cuts after the summer holidays.

1082,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>",China won't adopt 'flood-like' stimulus nor negative rates: regulator,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's top banking regulator said on Thursday that the country will not adopt ""flood-like"" stimulus nor negative rates, warning that unprecedented easing by the Federal Reserve will dent U.S. credibility.
Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), also urged major global economies to consider how to exit from massive easing.
""Major economies should actively consider the external impact of their own policies in a highly-integrated global economy,"" Guo told a finance forum held in Shanghai via video.
Policies adopted by developed countries have a big impact on developing nations, Guo said, urging governments to ""think thrice"" before rolling out fresh stimulus measures.
""There's no free meal in this world...and you must pay a price for your blank cheques,"" Guo said, citing lessons from the previous crisis.
""When you introduce large-scale stimulus, everyone is cheering. It may be very painful at the time of exit.""
China has guided lending rates lower, cut bank reserve requirements and pumped out trillions of yuan in liquidity but is cautious about opening the floodgates further as its economy gradually recovers from the coronavirus outbreak.
The Institute of International Finance estimated that China's total debt hit 317% of gross domestic product in the first quarter of 2020, up from 300% at end-2019, the largest quarterly increase on record.
Guo said a dollar-denominated global monetary system had played a role in stabilising the global economy, but massive domestic stimulus in the United States risks denting sovereign debt and dollar credibility.

The regulator said that it takes time for the global supply chain to recover, predicting that high inflation could return.

1083,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 01:20AM ET</span>",Chinese interest in Australian property shrinks as diplomatic rift grows,"By Jonathan Barrett and Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Chinese buyer enquiries for Australian homes fell to their lowest in almost three years in May, according to independent data, suggesting multi-billion dollar housing demand could be another casualty of a diplomatic spat between the two countries.
Data published by international property portal Juwai IQI shows enquiries slumped by more than 65% in May compared with April, when enquiries surged as Australia emerged from the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic ahead of most rival markets.
May's slide coincided with a move by Canberra to push for an investigation into the origins of the novel coronavirus, first detected in China late last year, drawing a sharp rebuke from Beijing and threats of economic reprisals.
A prolonged slump in interest from China's real estate buyers could spell trouble for a sector that has been a pillar of Australia's economy in recent years. Mainland China has been a major source of foreign real estate investment, with investors pouring A$6.1 billion ($4.2 billion) into residential and commercial construction and home auctions in the last financial year alone.
""If the situation doesn't escalate further things will stabilise,"" Juwai IQI Executive Chairman Georg Chmiel told Reuters in a phone interview. ""So long as it isn't prolonged, as long as it isn't systemic.""
May's drop means mainland China now ranks below the United States and Canada as the largest source countries for investment in property in Australia, the Juwai IQI data shows.
Chinese investment typically flows into new apartments, fuelling construction activity and employment.
But a slowdown in Chinese demand will be a fresh blow to the already slowing housing market, though official figures still show dwelling approvals up 5.7% from a year ago.
Economists generally expect the diplomatic tensions to be resolved without too much of a hit to Australia's economy, though the spat is an added risk to an already uncertain outlook.
""In the current environment the rise in tensions potentially will have a negative impact so it is somewhat concerning,"" said Sarah Hunter, chief economist at BIS Oxford.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) expressed concern at its June 2 policy meeting about the outlook for dwelling investment, with the construction pipeline drying up, auction activity slowing and rents creeping lower.
A pullback could further frustrate Canberra's attempts to reignite the economy, made more difficult by China's decision in May to start suspending beef imports from Australia's major meat processors, and impose hefty tariffs on barley.

1084,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 12:55AM ET</span>","China central bank to keep liquidity ample, weigh policy exit strategy","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will keep liquidity ample in the second half of the year, but it should consider in advance the timely withdrawal of policy measures aimed at countering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the country's central bank governor said on Thursday.
China's economic fundamentals remain sound and its financial markets are stable overall, Yi Gang told a financial forum in Shanghai.
""The financial support during the epidemic response period is (being) phased, we should pay attention to the hangover of the policy,"" Yi said.
""We should consider the timely withdrawal of policy tools in advance.""
The People's Bank of China had guided financing costs lower this year, Yi said.
New loans are likely to hit nearly 20 trillion yuan ($2.83 trillion) this year, up from a record 16.81 trillion yuan in 2019, and total social financing could increase by more than 30 trillion yuan, the governor said.
The bank's balance sheet remains stable around 36 trillion yuan, he added.
The PBOC has already rolled out a raft of easing steps since early February, including cuts in reserve requirements and lending rates and targeted lending support for virus-hit firms.
The economy has been recovering steadily after shrinking 6.8% in the first quarter, the first contraction on record.
Analysts expect the central bank to ease policy further to bolster economy.
Guo Shuqing, chairman of the banking and insurance regulator, told the same forum that China will not monetize fiscal deficits - a form of quantitative easing - and will not adopt negative interest rates.
It takes time for global supply chains to recover, and economies around the world have to re-think how to exit from massive easing measures that were rolled out in response to the coronavirus pandemic, said Guo.
Vice Premier Liu He said China's monetary policy should be more flexible, and it should strengthen counter-cyclical adjustments, in prepared remarks delivered at the Shanghai forum.

FRANKFORT, Ky. (Reuters) - Hundreds of people who lost jobs during the coronavirus crisis but have been unable to get their unemployment insurance checks converged at the Kentucky Capitol in Frankfort early Wednesday to seek in-person help.
Margaret Wells worked in retail in Louisville and has been unemployed since April. She has not been able to get anyone on the phone to answer questions about the status of her application for benefits. She has three kids and drove about an hour to come to the clinic. “I just need to talk to someone, that’s all I came all this way to do,” she said. 
States have been overwhelmed with the tens of millions of unemployment insurance benefits claims filed during the crisis, with the surge in demand crashing computer systems, clogging phone lines and creating backlogs of pending applications. 
Though more than 20 million Americans are currently receiving checks, many others have been unable to access their benefits, and struggle to pay for food and rent. 
Kentucky opened the temporary unemployment benefits office on Tuesday afternoon to help people resolve problems filing their claims, and on Wednesday Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said it would stay open through this week. ""No one in state government will be happy until every resident has the benefits they deserve,"" he said in a press conference. 
Whitney Jackson came from Lexington, about an hour's drive away. 
Her last day at work was March 6, before the university where she worked closed for spring break. It never reopened. When Jackson tried to file for unemployment insurance, she was not able to upload the documents to verify her identity. So when she heard that the state would offer in-person help, she said, ""at 5 o'clock this morning, I was up and ready."" 

After waiting in line for hours, it was a successful visit. ""I got my money!"" she said afterwards.

1088,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 08:10PM ET</span>",U.S. pulled out of stalled talks on digital services taxes: Lighthizer,"By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin decided to pull out of negotiations on digital services taxes with European Union officials after they failed to make any progress, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday.
Lighthizer told U.S. lawmakers that he still believed an international regime was needed to deal with taxation, but the talks with European countries were not proving fruitful.
""We were making no headway and the Secretary made the decision that ... rather than have them go off on their own, you would just say we're no longer involved in the negotiations,"" he said during a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee.
Treasury spokeswoman Monica Crowley said Washington had proposed pausing - not ending - talks among Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development countries on digital taxes and setting rules for international taxation.
""The United States has suggested a pause in the OECD talks on international taxation while governments around the world focus on responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and safely reopening their economies,"" she said.
A source briefed on the letter said Washington still felt an agreement was possible this year. 
Washington has been at odds with countries such as France and Britain over their plans to impose digital service taxes as a way to raise revenue from the local operations of big tech companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). 
Critics say the firms profit enormously from local markets while making only limited contributions to public coffers, but Washington views the taxes as discriminating against U.S. firms.
The U.S. comments came after the Financial Times reported that Mnuchin had called for suspension of the talks in a June 12 letter to top officials in France, Spain, Britain and Italy, and again threatened retaliatory action.
Lighthizer this month launched investigations to determine whether digital services taxes being adopted or considered by 10 countries - Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Italy, Spain, Turkey and Britain - amounted to unfair trade practices. If it finds they do, the U.S. government could impose new tariffs.
Washington previously initiated action against France for its digital services tax, but France later agreed to suspend the measure while the OECD worked out a standardized approach.
Spain insists the digital tax it is considering does not discriminate by country and will apply to companies regardless of where they are headquartered.
""Spain believes it’s necessary to adapt its fiscal system to the new economic reality of the 21st century; that was our position before receiving the letter, and continues to be so now,"" a government source told Reuters.

The French finance ministry confirmed it received Mnuchin's letter and was preparing a joint response with the other recipients.

1089,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 08:10PM ET</span>","Aussie house prices to go down under this year, no respite in sight - Reuters poll","By Tushar Goenka
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Australian house prices will decline this year and next as the damage from the coronavirus pandemic's disruption to the economy lingers on, with demand wilting on higher unemployment and lower immigration, a Reuters poll showed.
So far, the coronavirus has infected over 8.2 million people worldwide, including over 7,300 people in Australia. The pandemic has almost certainly marked the onset of a recession in the A$ 2.0 trillion economy after nearly three decades of continuous economic growth.
Australian house prices were expected to decline an average 5.0% nationally this year and tumble another 3.6% next year, according to the June 10-17 Reuters poll of 13 property market analysts.
That marks a U-turn from just three months ago when house prices were predicted to rise 7.0% this year and 4.0% next.
When asked how quickly Australian housing market activity would recover to pre-COVID levels, all but two of 11 analysts said it would be gradual.
""House prices will fall materially into 2021 as demand retreats on the back of deteriorating household finances and reduced population growth as border closures reduce net migration. This will remove a major driver of housing demand and economic growth,"" noted Adelaide Timbrell, economist at ANZ.
In a worst-case scenario, the median forecast of a slightly smaller sample pointed toward a 10.0% decline in prices this year and a further 8.0% slide in 2021, with forecasts ranging from -3.0% to as low as -30.0% for both years.
House prices in Sydney and Melbourne, where demand is mostly driven by overseas migrants, were forecast to fall 5.0% and 7.0% in 2020, respectively, sliding again by over 3.0% in 2021.
In Brisbane and Adelaide they were expected to fall anywhere between 0.5% and 4.0% this year and next.
When asked what would be the biggest hurdles to the country's housing market over the coming year, all 12 analysts said lower immigration and higher unemployment.
But the Australian government has announced a slew of measures, like loan payment holidays and a A$680 million ($471 million) package to encourage eligible residents to construct or significantly renovate their homes.
The Reserve Bank of Australia has also stepped in by lowering its interest rate to a record low of 0.25%, resulting in cheaper mortgages. But demand for housing has been low.
""Government stimulus may delay this weakness, but it won't be enough to prevent lower house prices eventually,"" added ANZ's Timbrell.

Economists predict the central bank will expand its bond-buying program by 100 billion pounds ($125 billion), taking it to 745 billion pounds, and investors are watching keenly for any hint of radical policies such as negative interest rates and yield curve control. The decision will be announced at noon in London.
The BOE has been forced into unprecedented measures to fight what may be Britain’s deepest economic slump in three centuries, linking up with the government to keep companies afloat and wages flowing.
Even as the country relaxes its lockdown controls -- non-essential stores were allowed to open their doors this week for the first time since March -- the prospect of a no-deal Brexit is putting companies on edge.
After data last week showed GDP shrank more than 20% in April, BOE Governor Andrew Bailey said officials stand ready to take more action.
Most analysts see the risks to the economy as clearly to the downside. The U.K. Treasury’s poll of private-sector economists, published on the eve of the BOE meeting, suggested the economy will recover more slowly than official forecasts imply.
Policy makers are extremely wary of scarring from the collapse in activity, as job losses and bankruptcies dampen future growth. Claims for unemployment benefits more than doubled during the first full two months of lockdown. Inflation has slowed to just a quarter of the BOE’s 2% target.
Against that backdrop, the BOE has cut its benchmark interest rate to a record-low 0.1%. It also restarted bond buying, helping the government afford its massive debt burden, and revived a program that directs cheap loans to companies that need them.
What Our Economists Say
“The central bank is likely to increase its asset purchase target by 100 billion pounds. The move would allow it to continue buying 13.5 billion pounds of gilts a week until its August meeting. We see a further extension of 100 billion pounds as likely in the summer.”

Yet Bailey and his colleagues have also repeatedly said no tools are ruled out, stoking speculation that options such as negative rates -- which are currently being reviewed -- might be next.
That tool has proved controversial in the rest of Europe though. Just one of the 43 economists surveyed by Bloomberg sees the BOE cutting below zero by year-end, and investors have pared bets on it happening, reckoning that other measures will be preferred first.
One possibility is that the BOE could lower the rate on its Term Funding Scheme, which helps banks provide much-needed credit to companies. That would echo the current strategy of the European Central Bank, which has cut the cost of long-term loans while keeping its official interest rates unchanged.
Other options include adding riskier securities to the asset-purchase program, helping to push down funding costs in financial markets, or deliberately targeting specific yields on bonds -- a policy the Bank of Japan already deploys.
“We are onside with consensus in expecting a significant increase in the BOE’s quantitative easing to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic and Brexit uncertainty,” said Christopher Dembik, head of macro analysis at Saxo Bank. “The overarching message should remain ultra-accommodative, with potential reference to negative rates if conditions require further support.”

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>","Japan firms curb jobs, cut pay to cope with coronavirus pain: Reuters poll","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - A majority of Japanese firms said they have taken steps - from lay offs to pay cuts - to cope with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic on the world's third-largest economy, according to a Reuters monthly poll.
Japan, like many other countries around the world, imposed lockdowns this year to curb the spread of the virus, crippling economic activity and exacerbating the country's first recession in 4-1/2 years.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has responded with two stimulus packages totalling $2.2 trillion - including payouts to citizens and ailing firms - but over half of the respondents in the poll were critical of the response. [L4N2DP19V]
Indeed, the latest Corporate Survey showed that many of the companies polled have had to curb hiring, lay off workers or cut pay to manage, dashing hopes for a solid recovery as private consumption accounts for more than half of Japan's economy.
""The jobless rate will remain on the uptrend as more and more firms will become unable to weather the economic pain,"" said Hisashi Yamada, senior economist at Japan Research Institute.
""Given the risk of a second wave of infections, the economy will recover only to a limited extent.""
Out of the 55% of Japan firms who saw the pandemic hitting their labour force, two in five said they have curbed new hiring, a quarter slashed pay and another quarter laid off workers, when asked to pick multiple responses, the poll showed.
Meanwhile, only 44% of Japanese firms said they appreciated the government's response to the economic fallout from the new virus, which many criticised as being too slow as it was tied up in bureaucratic red tape, the survey showed.
""A further delay in (government) response could trigger bankruptcies and cause a spike in the jobless rate,"" a manager at a construction firm wrote in the survey.
Asked what the government should focus the most on when dealing with the pandemic, 30% said the prevention of infections, while 29% said corporate financing, the survey carried out between June 2-12 showed.
GOING ONLINE
Economists expect Japan's economy to shrink at an annualised pace of more than 20% in April-June - which would mark a third straight quarter of contraction - mainly as a state of emergency from April through late May shut many businesses and hurt consumer spending.
In a positive development that could boost productivity, more and more companies are gradually shifting away from old-fashioned business practices that remain a stubborn anomaly in an otherwise high-tech nation.
Nine out of 10 firms saw an increase in the proportion of workers telecommuting since the virus outbreak, while around 90% of firms have taken steps to increase online meetings and avoid face-to-face contacts in daily business activity.
Some two-thirds of companies have lowered reliance on hard-copy paperwork such as for contracts and proposals, and about half the firms have reduced use of a traditional ""hanko"" or seal to stamp such documents. Some 3% have moved to adopt electronic seal.
The Reuters Corporate Survey, conducted for Reuters by Nikkei Research, canvassed 499 big and midsize non-financial companies, with around 230 of the firms answering questions on the virus impacts on employment and business practice.
Official data suggests Japan's job market has appeared to withstand a severe economic downturn amid the health crisis, with the jobless rate rising only slightly in April to 2.6%. But the survey underscored the view of some economists who say that rate could be much higher if you take into account discouraged workers and those on furlough.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Pensions Regulator (TPR) on Thursday published the framework for the launch of UK pension superfunds, a new structure designed to ease the burden of Britain's 2 trillion pound ($2.5 trillion) final salary pension sector on cash-strapped firms.
The new guidance, effective immediately, sets out the regulator's expectations on governance of so-called superfunds, how they are assessed and regulated, and the capital they must be supported by.
Britain is grappling with a spiralling pension funding problem after years of rock-bottom interest rates led to big gaps between the sums the pension schemes must pay out and the income they receive from investing.
Retired workers are also living longer and companies hit by economic shocks like the global financial crisis and coronavirus pandemic can sometimes struggle to find the cash they owe.
The superfunds work by consolidating assets from various company pension schemes, with a view to achieving economies of scale and more efficient money management.
""Well-run superfunds have the potential to deliver more secure retirement incomes for workers, while allowing employers to concentrate on what they do best – running their businesses,"" Minister for Pensions, Guy Opperman, said in a statement.
Pension superfunds provide an alternative to so-called bulk annuities - insurance policies for final salary schemes - offered by major insurers such as  Legal & General  (L:LGEN) and  Aviva  (L:AV).
Critics of superfunds have expressed concern about their capital adequacy but TPR said it will require schemes to hold sufficient assets and use special models to measure obligations so they can meet promises to savers with ""a high degree of certainty"".
TPR said it would provide further information to the market on the operation of its interim guidance before any specific legislation.

DPD said demand for its services had risen even before the UK entered its coronavirus lockdown in March, and had continued while people's access to shops was restricted.
""We are experiencing the biggest boom in online retailing in the UK's history,"" said Dwain McDonald, Chief Executive of DPD UK.
""We are making this unprecedented investment in our infrastructure and people to ensure we can continue to meet the high levels of demand for our services.""
Among the jobs being created, there will be 2,500 new full-time hires for positions such as in depots and management, and 3,500 new drivers are being recruited.
It will also invest 200 million pounds ($250 million) in its next-day delivery services.
Parcel delivery is one of the few industries which is growing during the economic maelstrom caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Britain's economy shrank by a quarter over March and April, and finance minister Rishi Sunak has admitted that unprecedented measures for government to help pay workers' wages during lockdown will not be enough to avoid job losses.
However, some companies are expanding. Last week broadband firm CityFibre said it would create up to 10,000 new jobs over the next three years.
DPD UK's McDonald said that elements of the online delivery boom would be permanent, outlasting the pandemic, and that conversations with retailers signalled a significant shift in behaviour in their models.
""It looks like there will remain a much greater reliance on e-commerce in the future - that's going to be our ‘new normal,'"" he said.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Banks across the United States are facing a shortage of coins during coronavirus crisis, prompting the U.S. Federal Reserve to ration distribution and work with the U.S. Mint to boost supply. 
With the partial closure of the economy due to the coronavirus crisis, ""the flow of coins through the economy has kind of stopped,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told the House Financial Services Committee. 
Making matters worse, the U.S. Mint has decreased production of coin due to measures put in place to protect its employees. 
""We are working with the Mint and the Reserve Banks and as the economy reopens we are seeing coins beginning to move around again,"" Powell said. He made the remarks in response to a question from Tennessee Congressman John Rose, who said a bank in his district told him it would run out of coins by the end of the week because the Fed was only sending a portion of its usual order of coins. 
""We all don't want to wake up to headlines in the near future such as 'Banks run out of money,'"" he said. Banks ""don't know what to tell their customers.""
Powell said he was well aware of the issue and believed it would be temporary. ""We feel like we are making progress,"" Powell said. 

The Fed on Monday told https://www.frbservices.org/resources/financial-services/cash/strategic-allocation.html banks it is working with the Mint to increase supply, but that until the shortage can be cured would limit the number of pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters it sends to them ""to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of coin inventory."" Allocations will be based on banks' historical patterns of coin orders, it said.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced on Tuesday that the United States intends to nominate Mauricio Claver-Carone, a Cuban-American lawyer and U.S. government official, to succeed the IADB's current president Luis Alberto Moreno of Colombia on Sept. 30.
Brazilian support for the Trump Administration's nominee all but ensures that Argentina's candidate, Gustavo Beliz, who had the backing of Mexico's leftist government, will be knocked out of the running.
The United States is the BID's largest shareholder with 30% of the voting rights, and Brazil has another 11.3% voting power.
Claver-Carone, an advocate for maintaining a tough economic embargo on communist-run Cuba, is currently director of the National Security Council for Western Hemisphere Affairs.
""The Brazilian government welcomed the announcement of the U.S. government's firm commitment to the future of the IADB through the North American candidacy for president of the institution,"" Brazil's Economy and Foreign Relations ministries said in a joint statement.
The statement said Brazil and the United States share the same values of defense of democracy, economic freedom and the rule of law, and Brazil backs a ""new management"" for the bank that follows those values.
Claver-Carone, who served as the U.S. Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2018, was a board member of the U.S.-Cuba Democracy PAC that worked for a democratic transition in Cuba while supporting the economic embargo against the island. He has also been a prominent critic of Venezuela's leftist government.

Private-sector forecasts call for the gross domestic product in the second quarter to decline by an annual rate of 25% to 40%, Mester said in remarks prepared for a virtual forum. ""Second-quarter growth could be the largest quarterly decline on record,"" she said.
Mester noted that unemployment remains at historically high levels despite the improvement seen in May, when the economy added 2.5 million jobs. She said the hit to the labor market may be worse than the numbers suggest, because many people left the work force and other workers had their hours cut.
The policymaker said she expects inflation to decline this year because of the sharp drop in demand caused by pandemic-related shutdowns.
The strength of the recovery will depend on the future spread of the virus and if consumers feel comfortable going out in public, she said.

""If the number of cases of the virus is not well controlled and the health-care system gets overwhelmed, then the economic outcomes I have discussed could turn out to be much more dire,"" Mester said, adding that people may choose to stay home and limit their activity even if states do not put in place another wave of restrictions.

1098,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>","Europe's wage schemes shielded households from most income losses, ECB says","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Government wage subsidy schemes shielded eurozone households from the majority of income losses during the bloc's pandemic-induced recession, and wage losses are now rapidly diminishing, a European Central Bank study showed on Wednesday. 
Under various ""short-time work"" initiatives, companies can temporarily cut working hours in periods of economic stress and governments pay most of the lost wages in exchange for job guarantees. 
Without such arrangements, households in the currency bloc would have lost 22% of their labour income at the height of the lockdown, but the actual loss was only around 7%, the ECB said in an Economic Bulletin article. 
""After the end of the lockdowns the low impact period illustrates that the loss in net labour income could diminish to -3%, while short-time work benefits rapidly diminish,"" the ECB added.
Over 35 million workers in the five biggest euro zone countries may have been on a short-time work scheme at the height of the crisis, the ECB said, a key reason why unemployment rose to just 7.3% in April, half of the rate in the United States.
The scheme, which allowed Germany to emerge from its 2009 recession quicker than most others, preserves jobs, household spending power and corporate margins, expediting any recovery. 

""Reducing household income uncertainty is a further channel through which public policy can help to alleviate the adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic on household spending,"" the ECB added.

(Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives panel is debating on Wednesday a Democratic plan to boost infrastructure spending that aims to fix crumbling roads and highways and reduce carbon pollution.
The $494 billion five-year surface transportation bill wouldprovide $319 billion to fix 47,000 structurally deficientbridges and make other repairs, $105 billion for mass transit, build electric vehicle charging stations and invest nearly $30 billion in passenger railroad Amtrak and rail infrastructure.
With a presidential election looming, few believe Congresswill tackle infrastructure this year, The current surface transportation law expires Sept. 30.
""Our system of roads, bridges, public transit and rail systems are badly outdated,"" said Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat who chairs the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. ""For years, Congress has bypassed solving the toughest problems plaguing our surface transportation system, allowing the system to limp along and fall farther and farther into disrepair and disservice.""
The top Republican on the panel, Representative Sam Graves, said the bill should be called the ""my-way-or-the-highway bill,"" saying the panel is ""now considering a $500 billion bill that we don’t know how to pay for.""
In April 2019, President Donald Trump and Democratic leadershad agreed to spend $2 trillion on infrastructure, withouthashing out a way to pay for it.
The White House plans to release its own proposal to extend current surface transportation funding for 10 years that could top $1 trillion.
Congress abandoned the practice of largely requiring road users to pay for road repairs and has not hiked the federal gas tax since 1993.

Since 2008, Congress has transferred about $141billion in general revenues to the Highway Trust Fund. Tomaintain existing spending levels, Congress will need to find$107 billion over five years, government auditors say.

1101,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 02:26PM ET</span>",EU post-COVID recovery plan likely to win backing in July: budget chief,"By Jan Strupczewski
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's economic recovery plan after the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to secure backing from member states in July, helping the 27-nation bloc emerge from the recession together, EU Budget Commissioner Johannes Hahn said on Wednesday.
EU leaders will tackle the European Commission's 750 billion euro plan for the first time on Friday, together with a 1.1 trillion euro proposal for the next EU budget for 2021-2027. The plan will need the approval of all member states to be adopted.
""I'm really confident because everybody understands the urgency,"" Hahn told Reuters in an interview. ""There might be some modifications, adaptations, but the general direction will stay,"" he said.
Under the proposal, the Commission is to borrow 750 billion euros on the market against higher government guarantees for the EU budget. Around 500 billion would be disbursed in grants and 250 billion as loans, to revive economies most badly damaged by the pandemic like Italy and Spain.
The Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Austria, dubbed ""the Frugal Four"", say the fund is too large and want it used only as loans, since grants would have to be repaid by all EU taxpayers.
But Hahn said grants were necessary to prevent the EU's single market of 450 million people from breaking up as the already high-debt southerners could not afford to borrow as much to help their economies as the lower-debt northerners. Their slower recovery would create dangerous economic divergences.
""If the European single market is really a single market, it means all these national economies have to pick up more or less at the same time... therefore provisioning via grants is necessary,"" he said.
""The grants should be seen by the 'frugals' as a kind of investment in more resilience, in better performance, which finally is in the interest of everybody,"" said Hahn.
""The 'frugals' should have an interest in economies like Italy or Spain picking up as fast as possible,"" he said, noting much of internal EU exports go from the north to the south.
Earlier on Wednesday, European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos, a Spaniard, said indebted euro zone countries needed grants rather than loans to deal with the pandemic's fallout to avoid digging themselves into a bigger debt hole.
But Sweden's EU minister said the recovery fund should be disbursed only as loans as handing out grants would be ""wrong"".
For its part, France hopes for a deal on the recovery fund in July, a presidential adviser said on Wednesday. ""I think there are nuances between the so-called Frugals Group,"" he said, seeing ""room for manoeuvre"" in the negotiations.
Hahn said the video-conference meeting on Friday would be a start but an in-person gathering would be needed to clinch a deal of such complexity as the long-term budget and recovery fund. ""This is something which will take place in July and I think then hopefully we can have a deal,"" he said.
He rejected criticism that 750 billion for the recovery of the EU was too large, pointing to Germany - with the EU's largest economy - which alone had a 1.2 trillion euro recovery blueprint. 

Hahn said the Commission's job was to ensure equality of recovery opportunities to keep the single market intact.

(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic is hitting minority communities harder than others and recent incidents of racial discrimination around the country have shed light on the moral and economic costs of racism, Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday. 
""The pandemic has hit lower-income and minority communities much harder than it has others and really exacerbated a lot of the structural inequalities that we had seen in this country,"" Bostic said Wednesday during a virtual event with the Atlanta Consular Corps. 
Bostic, the Fed's only African-American policymaker, last week issued an impassioned call for an end to racism and laid out ways the U.S. central bank can help do so. The policymaker repeated some of those views Wednesday, saying the economy can grow more quickly when there is full participation. 
""The cost of racism is not just on the moral dimension but it is also on the economic dimension and we need to acknowledge that,"" Bostic said. ""We're going to continue to respond. I think the Fed is well positioned to be an agent in that.""
The economy is starting to rebound as people return to work, but the pace of the recovery will depend on how cautious consumers are about going out in public, Bostic said. 
Some businesses in public-facing industries, including restaurants and hotels, are suffering, he said. A portion of the job losses will be temporary and people who can work remotely will be better off, he said.

""Willingness to take risk and the perception of risk will be important factors in determining how rapidly the economy will return,"" he said.

In a speech to the European Parliament on Wednesday, von der Leyen made no mention of the EU’s demand to maintain the status quo in fisheries, where British waters are divided between member states. The U.K. wants to take back control of its waters and make access subject to annual negotiations.
“No one questions the U.K.’s sovereignty on its own waters,” she said. “We ask for predictability and guarantees for our fishermen and women, who have been sailing in those waters for decades.”
Her comments come two days after she and Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to intensify talks amid some optimism they could break the deadlock in negotiations over the two sides’ future trading relationship in the coming weeks.
Von der Leyen limited her remarks on the role of the European courts in any accord to the part they would play “where it matters” in the area of police and judicial cooperation rather than in the wider trade deal.
That may still be too much for the British government. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove told the House of Commons on Tuesday: “We cannot agree to a deal which gives the EU Court of Justice a role in our future relationship.”
Bureaucratic Issue
The two sides still have a long way to go to overcome their differences. Von der Leyen stuck to the EU’s tough line the way any agreement is managed and how disputes are resolved, one of the major sticking points in talks.
“Governance may sound like an issue for bureaucrats,” she said. “But this is central for businesses and private citizens both in the U.K. and in the EU to ensure that what has been agreed is actually done.”
Formal negotiations will resume on June 29 in a more concentrated format than the previous series of talks every three weeks. Johnson said he wants a deal done in July, but the EU expects it will take at least until October.
The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told lawmakers the discussions will be difficult and could last for months, warning that they should be prepared for the possibility that a deal won’t be struck.
“With little time ahead of us, we will do all in our power to reach an agreement,” von der Leyen said. “What we are not ready to do is to put into question our principles and the integrity of our union.”

President Emmanuel Macron’s office also thinks that discounts could be offered to countries for their dues to the bloc as a way to build support for the plan, said the official, who requested anonymity because the plans are private.
The bloc’s 27 leaders will hold a video conference on June 19 for the first time to discuss the EU’s 750 billion-euro ($841 billion) plan that would funnel money to those countries most affected by the economic effects of the coronavirus. The proposal would make as much as 500 billion euros available as grants and 250 billion euros in loans.
The program, which needs to win the backing of every capital, would be funded by joint debt issuance in a significant step toward closer economic integration.
Budget Rebates
Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, which have voiced strong opposition to the extraordinary EU plan to issue common debt, received reductions in their contributions to the 2014-2020 budget of 130 million euros, 695 million euros and 185 million euros, respectively. Those rebates wouldn’t necessarily carry over into the next budget, which still needs to be finalized.
The Danish government has indicated that its top priority in the upcoming talks on the EU plan will be to maintain their budget rebate and that the other concerns were secondary.
No agreement on the budget or the recovery plan and the EU budget for 2021-2017 is expected at the meeting later this week, the French official said, echoing comments by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Rather, one or two in-person summits might be needed. The official added that an agreement was necessary by the end of July since other topics, such as climate change and Brexit, will also need to be dealt with.
France’s main priority is for the EU to disburse 500 billion euros in grants, in line with a proposal offered by Macron and Merkel, the official said, adding that conditions to obtain the funds should not be akin to the intrusive and bureaucratic standards of the post-2008 crisis bailout.
The official said Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden were the only ones to oppose grants.

""It's in no one's interest to see the situation get bogged down,"" the adviser said, adding that 'giant steps' had been made in recent weeks, including securing the backing of all EU countries for a joint debt mechanism to fund the package.
""Everyone agrees we need a significant and urgent recovery plan and a debt mechanism, which is no small feat,"" the adviser said.
However, he said differences remained over whether to distribute funds in the form of grants to the hardest-hit countries like Italy or via loans, as supported by the so-called ""Frugal Four"" group of countries.
""I think there are nuances between the so-called Frugals group,"" he said, seeing ""room for manoeuvre"" in negotiations.
""We would all have a price to pay if Europe got stuck into a rut again,"" he added, pointing to the fact the recovery fund was already largely priced in by financial markets and supported by public opinion across Europe.
Waiting to agree on the budget and recovery fund until September would not be ideal, the official said, because of other crises piling on, including Brexit talks and a new flare up of the migrant crisis.

The recession is hurting Americans unequally, taking the deepest toll on African Americans and other minorities, Powell said in prepared remarks for his testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. The remarks were identical to those he submitted prior to his testimony to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.
""If not contained and reversed, the downturn could further widen gaps in economic well-being that the long expansion had made some progress in closing,"" Powell said in his remarks. 

Congress has allocated nearly $3 trillion in financial relief and the U.S. central bank has pumped trillions of dollars of credit into the economy to cushion it from the fallout from the pandemic.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks will be given sufficient time to replenish capital buffers dented by heavier lending and rising loan losses during the COVID-19 pandemic, global banking regulators said on Wednesday, adding they could offer more relief to the sector if needed.
The Basel Committee of banking supervisors from Asia, the United States and Europe said a ""measured"" drawdown of capital and liquidity buffers in the current time of stress was appropriate.
""Supervisors will provide banks sufficient time to restore buffers, taking account of economic and market conditions and individual bank circumstances,"" the committee said in conclusions from two recent meetings made public on Wednesday.
Banks worry that reporting lower capital ratios by tapping buffers would be a red flag to investors, and regulators want to offer markets reassurance in advance.
Regulators have already taken several steps to help banks keep lending to customers during the pandemic, such as delaying upcoming capital rules and pushing back when they must set aside capital to cover loans that turned sour in the crisis.
""The Committee will continue to monitor the vulnerabilities and risks to the global banking system from COVID-19 and will pursue additional measures if needed,"" it said.
The committee also kept up the pressure on banks to end the use of the tarnished Libor interest rate benchmark. Lenders were fined for trying to manipulate the benchmark, which is being replaced by central bank rates.
Ending Libor, used for pricing contracts worth about $400 trillion globally, by the end of 2021 is one of the biggest tasks facing financial markets in decades.
""The Committee places high priority on this issue and expects all banks to be adequately prepared to meet the transition timeline,"" it said.
The regulators said they also intends to hold a public consultation on possible capital requirements for banks that hold crypto assets.

INSEE said the euro zone's second-biggest economy should contract 17% in the second quarter after a previous forecast last month of a 20% contraction.
The agency estimated that the economy was running at 22% below normal levels after the lockdown, imposed in mid-March, was eased on May 11. Activity was down as much as 33% in April.
Economic activity would be 12% below normal levels in June, INSEE said.
A rebound underway in consumer spending was also expected to prove sustainable, INSEE said. Consumer spending was only 7% below normal levels in May as more shops were allowed last month to reopen. Consumer spending was 31% below normal levels in April.
Consumer spending, traditionally the motor of French economic activity, was expected to be 5% below normal levels in June, INSEE estimated.
The agency said April would remain the worst-ever month the French economy has seen in peace time since records began.
French government put the country under one of Europe's most stringent lockdowns in mid-March to fight the COVID-19 pandemic spread.

Lighthizer told a House Ways and Means Committee hearing that Washington expected the next WTO director general to back the need for reforms and understand the problems of free economies in dealing with China.
""I think we need a director general that understands that an extremely large state-run economy cannot be disciplined under the current WTO rules,"" Lighthizer said, referring to longstanding U.S. complaints about China's unfair trade practices.

The bank said in its quarterly report that the worst blow dealt to the economy in 35 years was down to a tanking of domestic demand evidenced by economic activity figures for March and April, which contracted 3.5% and 14.1% respectively, after lockdowns to halt the spread of the coronavirus began. 
It said the broadening of lockdowns to cover all of the capital Santiago and the coastal city of Valparaiso in May and June would see more drastic decline in economic activity.
It projected a drop in 2020 domestic demand of 10.4% and saw inflation at 2%, the bottom end of its 2% to 4% target. The copper price that props up the economy would rally slightly to $2.50 per pound in 2020, it said. 
The latest 2020 estimate is a significant downward revision from the between -1.5% and -2.5% the bank predicted in April, weeks after the coronavirus arrived in Chile.
Shortly after that, President Sebastian Pinera spoke of a ""cautious"" reopening of the economy. The government was forced to shelve the plan after the virus moved to the poorer, more overcrowded sections of Santiago and infection numbers leaped into four figures. 
The bank said that Chile's economic pain was replicated around the world and the country was better placed to bounce back because of decades of ""sound macroeconomic and financial management."" It pointed to measures including the extension of funding to banks to support credit lines for small and medium businesses, and a two-year, $12 billion economic stimulus package announced by the government over the weekend. 
It foresaw a rallying of the economy with the likely end of lockdowns in the third quarter, and growth of between 4.75% and 6.25% in 2021 and 3% and 4% in 2022.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The National Bank of Hungary is expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Tuesday, according to a poll of analysts, but could set the stage for some easing of policy lowering its outlook for economic growth.
All 16 economists polled between June 15-17 said the NBH would leave its base rate  at 0.9%. The 12 analysts who gave a forecast for the overnight deposit rate  said it would stay at -0.05% on June 23, when policy makers review the bank's quarterly inflation report.
The poll sees no change in either the base rate or the overnight deposit rate before the end of next year.
Analysts expect Hungary's economy to shrink by 5.1% this year after the coronavirus pandemic shut factories and curtailed activity, a far cry from the central bank's March forecast for a 2% to 3% expansion.
Peter Virovacz, an economist at ING, said a downgrade to the bank's growth projection could lead to a more dovish tone in its policy statement.
""In the short run, the NBH will react with its unconventional tools, mainly adjusting the rate of the 1-week deposit facility and/or putting a limit on this facility,"" he said.
""The mix of a stable HUF and the expected decline in CPI should eventually lead to some reversal of the prior FX stabilising hikes.""
Tuesday's session will be the first rate-setting meeting of the Monetary Council since the resignation of Deputy Governor Marton Nagy, the architect of many of the bank's unconventional monetary easing programmes. He will be replaced by Managing Director Barnabas Virag.

""We now think that the NBH is likely to start easing monetary conditions through first limiting the amounts it accepts in the 1W deposit facility,"" economists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration will push for a broad reset of ""outdated tariff determinations"" at the World Trade Organization to right what it sees as years of unfair treatment of the United States, a top trade official will tell lawmakers on Wednesday.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said changes in the tariffs set by the Geneva-based WTO were urgently needed to better reflect current economic realities.
""Many countries with large and developed economies maintain very high bound tariff rates, far above those levied by the United States,"" he said in prepared testimony for separate hearings to be held by the U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee.
He said Washington would seek broader support for its proposals concerning notification enforcement and “special and differential treatment” for developing countries.
The Trump administration has complained for years about the WTO's failure to hold China accountable for unfair trade practices, and insists that China - the world's second-largest economy - should no longer be treated as a developing country.
Lighthizer said the WTO and its Appellate Body had treated the United States as ""the world's greatest trade abuser"" despite its large trade deficit, by finding the United States at fault in up to 90% of disputes filed before the trade organization.
Doing so had undermined the WTO's negotiating process since countries now believed they could obtain better outcomes through litigation, he said.
Washington last year already crippled the WTO's ability to intervene in trade wars after blocking appointments to the Appellate Body, which rules on appeals in disputes.
Lighthizer said the Trump administration also would continue to pursue formal challenges to practices of foreign countries that it believes violate WTO rules, such as the U.S. probe of digital services taxes announced on June 2.
He said the administration was also considering lowering the current $800 ""de minimus threshold"" up to which products can be shipped into the United States duty-free. The U.S. rate far exceeds that of its major trading partners, Lighthizer said. 
He said the United States received a combined 1.2 billion de minimis shipments in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, of which 60% came from China, compared to just 68 million formal entries during the same period, of which less than 11% came from China.

""The disproportionately high volume of these shipments indicates China and others are likely exploiting the high U.S. de minimis threshold to avoid paying duties,"" he said.

1120,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>",Explainer: What Britain and the EU have to sort out to get a trade deal,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union have said they will intensify negotiations on reaching a comprehensive agreement on the terms of their future relationship.
Below are the four main areas where negotiators still have to overcome differences before a Brexit transition period, which began when Britain quit the bloc, runs out at the end of this year.
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR COMPANIES
Though Britain left the EU on Jan. 31, the main terms of its membership will remain in place until the end of the transition period. But from the start of next year, it will no longer be bound by the EU's rules on state aid for companies and the bloc's environmental or labour standards. 
If Britain allows these standards to deteriorate or does not keep up with evolving EU rules, British companies selling to the bloc will have what EU officials see as an unfair competitive advantage over their EU rivals bound by the costly regulations.
If British firms are to have easy access to the bloc's market, the EU says Britain must commit to sticking to similar standards as the EU has. 
FISHERIES
Britain wants to catch fish in its waters and sell them to the EU, a market of 450 million people. But EU fisherman also want access to British waters and want to know in advance how much fish they can catch to help plan their business. The trade-off between access to the EU market for British fishermen and access to Britain's waters by EU fisherman is at the heart of the dispute.
POLICE COOPERATION
British police want access to various EU databases that contain sensitive personal records, such as DNA, and the EU wants to have legal guarantees that the data will be treated with the confidentiality required by EU law. 
The EU wants Britain to observe the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), an international agreement to protect human rights and political freedoms in Europe which allows any person who feels their rights have been violated to sue a government in the European Court of Human Rights.
GOVERNANCE

The EU and Britain have to find a way to settle mutual disputes in the future. While some form of international arbitration could be established, the EU can accept only its own top court -- the Court of Justice of the European Union -- as the institution that interprets EU law. Britain does not want EU courts ruling in disputes it may have with the bloc.

Speaking to French and German lawmakers in a video conference, Scholz cautioned however that the technical details of such a carbon border adjustment tax were complicated and that an agreement among EU member states would probably take one or two more years.
The European Union wants to put a tax on goods imported into the EU from countries that do not have the bloc's ambitious goals for the reduction of CO2 emissions, to protect European companies which will have to abide by the higher standards.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet on Wednesday passed another extra budget to finance its bumper stimulus package, pushing up overall new borrowing to a record 218.5 billion euros ($245.35 billion) this year in its fight against the coronavirus.
The bold move shows how far centre-left Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has moved Germany away from its image as Europe's austerity champion to become one of the biggest spenders in the euro zone's efforts to rebound from the pandemic.
""Now we gonna spit in our hands, we increase the gross national product,"" Scholz told a news conference to present the second supplementary budget within three months, citing the refrain of a famous German 1980s pop song.
Scholz pointed out that Germany could afford ""this fiscal act of strength"" because the government had reduced its debt burden in economic good times and now had solid public finances.
""We are not saving up against the crisis,"" Scholz added.
The finance minister said Germany was benefiting from record low borrowing costs which would push down Berlin's bill for debt servicing to 9 billion euros this year from some 12 billion euros last year -- despite the additional record new borrowing.
Germany now plans to sell 218.5 billion euros of additional debt this year, equivalent to 6.5% of economic output.
Germany expects its debt-to-GDP ratio to jump to around 77% in 2020 from just below 60% in 2019, officials said on Monday. The overall public sector budget deficit is seen reaching 7.25% of GDP this year after a budget surplus of 1.5% last year.
Germany is planning to implement stimulus measures worth more than 130 billion euros overall, the lion's share of which will be put in place in the second half of this year.
Among the measures are a temporary cut in value-added tax, cash handouts for parents, funds to rescue small firms from bankruptcy, bigger incentives to buy electric cars and cash injections to stabilise the social security system.

1126,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>","As the ECB ponders purchases, bond angels aren't falling","By Francesco Canepa
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - An expected wave of credit rating cuts for companies as a result of the coronavirus crisis has yet to materialise, data shows, meaning speculation that the European Central Bank will buy bonds of ""fallen angels"" downgraded to junk may be premature. 
The ECB has warned there is ""considerable risk of imminent downgrades"" for euro zone corporate bonds, many of which could be pushed into the speculative grade or ""junk"" category. 
That would force large investors such as insurance and pension funds, which are largely restricted to investment-grade assets, to sell any bonds they hold, hitting prices and hampering companies' ability to refinance debt.
Sources have told Reuters ECB staff are considering whether to add recently downgraded bonds to its 1.35 trillion euro ($1.52 trillion) emergency stimulus programme, as the Federal Reserve has done to help support the U.S. economy. 
But Refinitiv data compiled by Reuters shows only three companies that qualify for ECB purchases have lost their investment-grade status since April 7 -- French auto-maker  Renault  (PA:RENA), German airline Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and Berlin-based real-estate group Ado Properties (DE:ADJ). 
The ECB currently accepts debt downgraded to junk after April 7 as collateral when lending to banks, and that date could mark a cut-off point if it decides to add junk-rated debt to its Corporate Sector Purchase Programme. 
Even going back to mid-March, when coronavirus lockdowns began, would add only two issuers, German car-parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen and Italian retailer Esselunga.
""This measure (buying ""fallen angel"" debt) would be very controversial and only affect a few names to date, which are all protected by the collateral backstop, so I don't expect it will be introduced,"" said Marco Brancolini, a strategist at Nomura.
The ECB does not have to sell downgraded debt it already owns but cannot buy new bonds from issuers that do not have at least one investment-grade rating from S&P Global, Moody's (NYSE:MCO), Fitch or DBRS.
Adding up all the bonds downgraded since March 22 gives total debt outstanding of 9.275 billion euros ($10.45 billion) -- less than 5% of the 212 billion euros' worth of corporate bonds held by the ECB.
The Fed is already buying junk bonds, with a backstop from the U.S. Treasury which would bear the first losses.
Isabel Schnabel, the ECB board member in charge of the asset purchase programme, has said that mechanism would be difficult to replicate in the 19-country euro zone.
Downgrades could come with a delay and in waves, as happened after the global financial crisis that began in 2007. If that pattern is repeated, the ECB estimates a nominal 110 billion euros of bonds could be downgraded to junk over the next year.
Some, however, see rating agencies as more cautious this time around.

""Only Fitch has been aggressive so far, but it now seems to have slightly softened its reaction function while Moody's, S&P and DBRS have taken a decidedly wait-and-see approach,"" Nomura's Brancolini said.

The government abandoned its push to enact a bill during the current session of parliament, which ended on Wednesday, that would raise prosecutors' retirement age to 65 from 63, and let the cabinet defer retirement of senior prosecutors for a further three years.
Critics and others argued it would threaten judicial independence.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga that the government would want civil servants with abundant knowledge and experiences to keep working.
""There is no change to our views that raising the retirement age for civil servants is needed to address properly to administrative issues that have become complex and advanced,"" he told a news conference.

Tokyo's top prosecutor Hiromu Kurokawa, who is seen as close to Abe, resigned in May for gambling, which is illegal in Japan, during Japan's coronavirus state of emergency, when citizens have been asked to observe social distancing guidelines and avoid unnecessary outings.
Kurokawa was at the centre of a furore over the government's efforts to raise the retirement age for prosecutors after he was allowed to stay in his post beyond retirement age of 63.
The government would aim to resubmit the bill to the next parliament, which may start in autumn, or later, the Nikkei business daily said.

Investing.com -- China tightens lockdown restrictions to stop a second wave of infections in and around Beijing, while its soldiers come to deadly blows with India's on a disputed border. The two Koreas are also at each other's throats. Stocks are set to open modestly higher, ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's second day of testimony, but news from Norwegian Cruise Lines and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) will cast a shadow over the beleaguered travel sector. European car sales recover moderately from April's collapse, and OPEC and the U.S. government will give their two cents' worth on the state of the oil market. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 17th June.
1. Beijing tightens restrictions after new Covid-19 outbreak; Fauci warns it isn't over in the U.S. 
The Chinese capital tightened lockdown restrictions to tackle what authorities called an “extremely severe” outbreak of the Covid-19 virus, illustrating the pitfalls of the world’s return to normality after a destructive first wave of the pandemic.
Beijing closed its schools, universities and entertainment venues and cancelled over 1,000 flights,  and authorities also instated a three-week quarantine rule in the neighboring province of Heilonjiang.  However, they haven’t as yet ordered the closure of factories and shops.
The news comes as the U.S. wrestles with a rise in new infections in states from Florida and Texas to California. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, told the Financial Times that “All you need to do is look at the data, the facts, to see that the pandemic is not over by any means. The numbers speak for themselves.”
Vice-President Mike Pence had downplayed talk of a second wave of infections in the U.S. as “overblown” panic in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal published on Tuesday.
2. Chinese and Indian soldiers die in border skirmish; Korean tensions rise
The world’s two most populous nations are at each other’s throats over a border dispute. At least 20 soldiers died in a clash between Chinese and Indian troops in a disputed region of the Himalayas mountain range, according to information from the countries’ armed forces.
The clash came as Indian forces tried to verify that China had honored a pledge to vacate certain disputed parts of their joint border.
Elsewhere in Asia, North Korea threatened to redeploy troops to its demilitarized border with South Korea and resume “all kinds of regular military exercises” in a further escalation of tension after blowing up a building that was supposed to host peace talks between the two countries on Tuesday.
South Korea responded with warnings of its own. Relations between the two have worsened considerably since the collapse of President Donald Trump’s peace overtures to North Korea in 2018.
3. Stocks set to open higher, but travel sector weighs 
U.S. stocks are set to open with modest gains ahead of the second day of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s Congressional testimony.
Powell had again warned of a slow and bumpy recovery on Tuesday, although he acknowledged that the worst may be over for the U.S. economy, on a day when fresh data showed retail sales and industrial production rebounded in May.
By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract was up 59 points, or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 0.3% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.4%.
Stocks in focus on Wednesday are likely to include Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH), which extended the suspension of sailings by some of its biggest brands through September in an announcement after the bell on Tuesday. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) may also come under pressure after saying it would keep middle seats open on its flights due to Covid-19 concerns, reducing its effective capacity.
4. Tesla's Cali sales plunge; European auto sales recover weakly
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock will also be in the spotlight after a report suggesting that its sales in California fell 37% in April and May.  The report, citing data from Dominion Enterprises, underlines the problems in keeping the company’s sales momentum in a key state market going.
The news comes at a time when car sales worldwide are flagging. Data released in Europe on Wednesday showed new car registrations down over 53% on the year in May, although this was an improvement from a decline of over 70% year-on-year through April. The biggest increase came in Italy, where sales had all but ground to a halt in the first full month of its pandemic lockdown.
5. EIA, OPEC to update on oil markets
The U.S. government will release its weekly report on domestic oil supplies at 10:30 AM ET, with analysts’ estimates of a 152,000 barrel decline in crude inventories looking vulnerable to a negative surprise after the American Petroleum Institute reported a surprise increase in stocks late on Tuesday.
Before that, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will release its monthly report on the state of the oil market and is expected to corroborate the International Energy Agency’s upward revisions to crude demand for this year and next.
The Russian news agency TASS reported meanwhile that parties to the ‘OPEC+’  deal on output restraint were still failing to comply fully with the deal in May, something that could make Russian support for a further extension more problematic.
U.S. crude futures were down 0.8% at $38.06 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 0.4% at $40.77 a barrel."
1129,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Amid Brexit impasse, Germany urges no-deal preparations - document","By Andreas Rinke
BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government is urging other EU states to prepare for a no deal Brexit, according an internal document that casts doubt on Britain's optimism over chances of an early agreement on its future ties with the bloc.
Britain left the European Union on Jan. 31 and their relationship is governed by a transition arrangement that keeps previous rules in place while new terms are negotiated.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who confirmed last week that Britain has no intention of extending that transition beyond 2020, wants to strike a free trade deal quickly. 
On Monday, he suggested an agreement could be reached in July with ""a bit of oomph"". But the German government document, dated June 15 and seen by Reuters, shows Berlin expects the negotiations to take longer.
""From September, the negotiations enter a hot phase,"" it read. ""Britain is already escalating threats in Brussels, wants to settle as much as possible in the shortest possible time and hopes to achieve last-minute success in the negotiations.""
The German Foreign Office was convinced the transition deal would not be extended beyond the end of this year, the government document showed.
""It is therefore important to preserve the unity of the 27, to continue to insist on parallel progress in all areas (overall package) and to make it clear that there will be no agreement at any price,"" the document read. 
""Therefore, both national and European contingency planning would now have to start in order to be prepared for a no deal 2.0.""
The withdrawal agreement on Britain's departure was only struck after bitter negotiations that threatened to end in a no deal Brexit, but Berlin did not believe the situation was as critical this time around.
""The situation is less serious than in 2019, as important regulations, for example for citizens, were sorted out in the withdrawal agreement,"" the document read.

With the two sides so far apart and little time left to negotiate, there are concerns that London's decision not to extend the transition might lead to a cliff edge that could compound the economic damage caused by the coronavirus crisis.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's meat importers fear clearing delays and a hit to demand after one of the country's major ports began requiring coronavirus tests for all meat and seafood containers to prevent contamination. 
Tianjin on the northern coast, the primary port for Beijing, started testing batches from every arriving container on Monday, two importers and an official briefed on the matter said. 
Tianjin port and customs officials did not respond to calls seeking comments.
The government of Shanghai, another major port for meat imports, said on Wednesday its customs would strengthen inspections of imported meat, seafood and fresh fruit and vegetables.
It did not specify if it would also carry out coronavirus tests.
China is the world's top meat importer and many meat exporting nations, including the United States and Brazil, have seen thousands of cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, among meat plant workers. 
Authorities usually conduct food safety tests on a random sample of about 10% of frozen meat shipments, Grace Gao, manager at Dalian-based meat importer Goldrich International, said. 
Now, every container in Tianjin is opened and boxes pulled out for coronavirus tests, she said. 
The move by Tianjin, 110 km (70 miles) from Beijing, follows a fresh coronavirus outbreak linked to a wholesale food market. 
""Each batch of beef, or all beef produced on the same date, must be tested for the virus,"" a manager at Haiyunda Trading, who only gave his surname Fu, said. 
Any meat in cold storage that arrived after March 1 must also be sealed and tested before it can leave the port, Fu said. 
Gao, who has shipments arriving this week in Guangzhou, Tianjin and Shanghai, is worried the tests will cause a backlog, particularly given the large volume of pork that has arrived in China in recent weeks. 
The United States Meat Export Federation said so far it had seen minimal disruption of U.S. shipments. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration was aware China would begin testing seafood and meat, spokesman Peter Cassell told Reuters.
But he said the regulator did not know of any cases of COVID-19 linked to these foods or of any transmission from food or packaging.
""The FDA is not currently aware of any evidence to suggest that food produced in the United States or imported from countries affected by COVID-19 can transmit this respiratory virus,"" he said.
Importers fear other ports may follow Tianjin and Gao said any positive test would destroy consumer demand. 
Fu said he was trying to import from regions and countries where COVID-19 is less severe, such as northern Europe and Kazakhstan.

""If test results for products from certain countries or factories turn out to be problematic, imports from those places could be suspended,"" he said.

She said 1 million furloughed workers were working again and 300,000 new workers had registered with social security.
""The recovery phase has already started,"" she told parliament, adding that the trend change was backed by various indicators, mainly the latest job creation data.
While the Spanish economy is heading for the worst contraction on record in 2020, of up to 11.6%, the Bank of Spain forecast the recovery would start in the second half of this year, with GDP likely to bounce back and grow by 7.7% to 9.1% next year.
It expected the economy to bottom out in the second quarter with a slump of around 22%, but recovery in the tourist-dependent country should be a little stronger than the euro zone average.
Early indicators, such as Spanish services and factory PMIs, showed businesses partly resumed activity in May after plunging in April.

Spain is emerging from a three-month lockdown after the virus caused one of the world's heaviest death tolls.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli monetary policymakers are content with the current level of interest rates and would weigh using other measures to supply credit to the economy before reducing its rate to zero or negative territory, Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron said.
The central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate  to 0.1% from 0.25% in April and opted to leave the rate unchanged in late May, saying the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic was likely to be less severe than initially feared.
""We feel there are costs and benefits in lowering further. We feel comfortable where we are given this cost-benefit analysis right now,"" Yaron said in an interview with Reuters, adding other factors play into deciding to cut further.
""It doesn't mean we won't do it,"" he said. ""It just means it's part of a wholesome view of our monetary policy. We have more ammunition under our belt if needed and depending how the crisis develops.""
Yaron said the bank's main aims were to ensure financial markets function and households have proper access to credit. To that end, the bank took steps to rein in medium- and longer-term bond yields with loans to banks and repo and swap transactions. It also committed to buy 50 billion shekels ($14 billion) of government bonds to bring yields back to near crisis levels.
By easing capital requirements, Yaron also encouraged Israeli banks to give credit and ease loan pay-back terms.
He praised Israel's leaders in locking down the country early, even though it hurt the economy and sent unemployment soaring. So far, Israel has recorded 302 corona deaths and some 19,000 infected.
Many restrictions have been eased, but the central bank's base scenario foresees a 4.5% contraction in 2020 and growth of 6.8% in 2021, which Yaron said would still be 2 to 3 points below the 3% growth of the past few years. The jobless rate is expected to improve to 5.5% in 2021 from 8.5% in 2020.
Growth, he said, depended on various factors but for now, the central bank was hopeful the ""vibrant"" economy with an advanced tech sector would avoid a more pessimistic outcome that would stem from a second wave.
""Until there is a vaccine, there will be a glass ceiling of economic activity,"" Yaron said, noting that instead of a ""V"" shape, the crisis looked more like the "" Nike  (NYSE:NKE) logo"" in which the recovery in 2021 will take longer. ""We need to be creative and find ways to open up segments of the economy.""
Yaron was in favour of the country's 100 billion-shekel stimulus package, even though it would send the 2020 budget deficit to around 11% of gross domestic product and the debt to GDP ratio to 75%.
""As long as the spending is to support the economy for the crisis ... that is spending that the markets will understand. You need to think about it as an investment in minimizing the short-run damage,"" he said. ""Once the crisis is over, Israel will have to lower its deficits and take care of that structural deficit that has grown in the past.""
The central bank has also been forced to intervene to curb the shekel's  gains. ""The last thing we need is for the export sector to face exchange-rate pressures so ... we are somewhat less favourable about some of the appreciation that has happened since the onslaught of the crisis,"" Yaron said.

1134,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 02:36AM ET</span>",U.S. Plans a ‘Broader Reset’ of Its WTO Tariff Committments,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s trade chief, Robert Lighthizer, will tell U.S. lawmakers Wednesday that the time has come to renegotiate America’s fundamental tariff commitment at the World Trade Organization.
“Currently, outdated tariff determinations are locked in place that no longer reflect members’ policy choices and economic conditions,” Lighthizer said in prepared remarks to be delivered to the Senate Finance Committee starting at 3 p.m. in Washington. He’s scheduled to testify earlier in the day to the House Ways and Means Committee.
“Many countries with large and developed economies maintain very high bound tariff rates, far above those levied by the United States,” the trade representative said. “The United States must ensure that tariffs reflect current economic realities to protect our exporters and workers.”
The election-year gambit could help the White House increase its pressure on various nations and trading blocs with whom the U.S. does not have an existing free-trade agreement, like the European Union, the U.K., India and Brazil.
The development could also roil the WTO, which is struggling for relevance at a time of growing protectionism and facing the prospect of a leadership void when its Director-General Roberto Azevedo steps down in September.
Trump and his senior aides have long complained about the fact that other countries can charge higher tariffs on certain products than the U.S. does. They cite examples such as steeper European passenger-car duties and Indian motorcycle tariffs as evidence of the way they believe global trading rules are tilted against America.
Lighthizer’s plan is to launch a formal renegotiation of American tariff commitments at the WTO by threatening to increase U.S. tariff ceilings -- or bound rates -- agreed to by previous administrations over decades of negotiations, according to people familiar with the discussions. Bloomberg initially reported his plan in February.
The U.S.’s average bound rate is now 3.4%, which is among the lowest for major developed countries and has remained virtually unchanged for more than a decade. By comparison, the average levels for India are 51% and Brazil’s are 31%.
A broad renegotiation of America’s bound tariffs would be the most significant shift in U.S. trade policy over the past quarter century and would have myriad implications for the WTO’s other 163 members.
While the U.S. president cannot unilaterally change America’s bound WTO tariff rates, he does have the authority to trigger a modification of U.S. duties under a provision in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Brexit Talks
That kind of negotiation is permitted under WTO rules and is not particularly rare. The U.K. and the EU are currently reworking their WTO commitments to account for Britain’s exit from the European trading bloc.
If the U.S. were to follow WTO protocol, it would notify members that it intends to raise its specific bound tariff rates and encourage any nation with a substantial trading interest to begin negotiations to obtain trade concessions in return.
The administration’s strategy is to start with a proposal to renegotiate America’s WTO tariffs with the expectations that the WTO’s other members would not collectively agree to new multilateral terms.
If and when WTO talks fail, the Trump administration would then consider moving forward unilaterally to impose reciprocal tariffs on America’s trade partners.

1135,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>",Ka-boom! How Germany's 'Mr Thrift' Scholz came to splash the cash,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - Four months is an eternity in pandemic politics. As recently as February, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz was Germany's Mr Thrift, a devotee of the ""black zero"" balanced-budget rule.
Since then he has jettisoned the country's deep-rooted fiscal conservatism and outstripped more freewheeling European allies to push for its biggest debt-financed stimulus package during peace time. On Wednesday, Scholz will present a supplementary budget that pushes up new debt to a record 218.5 billion euros this year - equal to about 6.5% of German output.
Even his tone and language has marked a departure for the usually reserved and technical Scholz, who pledged to use a ""bazooka"" to help struggling companies and get Europe's largest economy out of the crisis ""with a ka-boom"".
The pandemic has reversed his fading political fortunes, according to three government officials, a parliamentary budget source and a member of the leadership team of his Social Democratic Party (SPD). This has allowed him to gather support from the left of the coalition government without being seen to betray the fiscal orthodoxy of the right, they said.
It has even put the 62-year-old in the running to become the next German leader.
""The coronavirus crisis is giving Scholz new momentum. He can implement a policy shift without violating his own principles,"" said a senior government official and veteran member of Scholz's SPD.
This momentum is also making its mark on Europe, according to the sources, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Scholz sees the turmoil as a window of opportunity to advance his long-term goals, they said: strengthening EU integration and making a big leap towards a closer fiscal union, at a time when the bloc's cohesion is threatened by Brexit and challenges from the United States and China.
""Never let a good crisis go to waste,"" the finance minister said himself last month, quoting Winston Churchill.
Such ambitions seemed unlikely at the end of last year when Scholz suffered the biggest political defeat of his career, losing the race to become leader of the SPD, which governs in coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives.
Now, though, Scholz has no serious rival standing in his way to become his centre-left party's candidate to replace Merkel in an election next year.
However political analyst Lucas Guttenberg, deputy director at the Jacques Delors Centre in Berlin, cautioned that the fiscal shift that has boosted Scholz's standing at home and abroad could be temporary.
""Calls for belt-tightening both domestically and in Europe will re-emerge as soon as the immediate crisis fades,"" he said.
Such a reversal could see longstanding criticism of Scholz resurface, including those from the SPD left, which accused him of mimicking the fiscally prudent policies of his conservative predecessor Wolfgang Schaeuble and said his apparent lack of emotion alienated voters.
CRISIS MANAGER
When asked to comment for this article, Scholz's spokesman said the minister's recent fiscal change of tack was entirely consistent with his support of the Keynesian theory of counter-cyclical spending - taking on new debt in a downturn and reducing the debt burden during good times.
""Use your full strength in a crisis and use it quickly,"" he added. 
Indeed, in a Reuters interview about the balanced budget last October, he insisted he saw no need to take on new debt, as weaker growth was still growth - but he also said, presciently as it turned out, that he would go all-in if a crisis struck.
""Scholz can style himself as a competent, decisive crisis manager now while putting Berlin's fiscal policy upside down,"" another official close to Scholz told Reuters, adding that the finance minister was liaising closely with Merkel on the matter.
The fiscal U-turn is supported by Merkel, who managed to convince budget hawks in her own conservative camp to drop concerns and back massive deficit-spending to fight what is forecast to be Germany's deepest economic recession since the end of World War Two, a third official said.
""Nobody here talks about the black zero anymore,"" the person said in reference to the balanced-budget goal devised by Schaeuble and diligently adhered to by members of Merkel's bloc.
Scholz has gone down well with the public too, with polls ranking him as the second-most popular politician after Merkel.
'HAMILTONIAN MOMENT'
On the European level, Scholz was involved in a Franco-German plan for a European Recovery Fund to enable the European Commission to take on joint debt of 500 billion euros and channel the money to member states worst hit by COVID-19.
While the decision was publicly announced by Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron last month, Scholz was one of the architects of the agreement behind the scenes, according to a senior diplomat from a southern EU country.
Southern states like Italy and Spain have been hit hard by the novel coronavirus and have been pushing for Germany to loosen its fiscal conservatism to help them weather the crisis.
Scholz is also in favour of allowing Brussels to obtain its own revenues through a financial transaction tax or the emission trading scheme.
One of the officials close to Scholz said he wanted to deepen EU ties, and for the bloc to experience its ""Hamiltonian moment"" - a reference to Alexander Hamilton, the first U.S. Treasury Secretary who pooled fiscal powers at a federal level in the late 18th century to generate common revenues and to create independent debt capacities.
Analyst Guttenberg noted that in recent years Germany had shown little interest in bolstering European cooperation and ties. ""It is very good news that this has changed in the face of the sheer depth of this crisis,"" he added.
NETWORK OF ALLIES
Scholz, who became vice chancellor and finance minister in 2018, has assembled a network of allies at the ministry, a colossal stone building in Berlin dating from the Nazi era.
Among the new faces are Deputy Finance Minister Joerg Kukies, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker and longtime SPD member; Chief Economist Jakob von Weizsaecker, an ex-SPD lawmaker of the European Parliament; State Secretary Wolfgang Schmidt, the well-connected and energetic right-hand man of Scholz; as well as chief spokesman Steffen Hebestreit, a former journalist.
Scholz is a master of surrounding himself with top people who share his vision and complement his skills, said one of the officials close to the finance minister.
The pandemic has aided his ambitions to become the SPD's chancellor candidate by dissolving some of the most contested issues within the party.
With the balanced budget gone and Germany's debt brake suspended, the pandemic has removed the biggest hurdle for Scholz to be supported by the SPD's left wing, a member of the party's leadership team said.
The senior SPD member, who describes himself as a critic of Scholz, said the finance minister had done an ""impressive job"" during the crisis, and that his chances of becoming the party's next chancellor candidate were high.

He added, though, that Scholz's inability to connect with voters remained a weakness: ""His talk about bazookas and ka-boom is actually a bit clumsy. You can't change the way you think, talk and act, just like that.""

1137,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 10:18PM ET</span>",China’s Tumbling Bond Market Needs a Big Liquidity Injection,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors in China’s tumbling sovereign bonds are counting on Beijing to unleash more cash into the financial system.
A flood of issuance, liquidity withdrawals and returning risk appetite globally have combined to accelerate the selloff in Chinese government debt, with the yield on 10-year cash bonds approaching its highest level since February. On Tuesday, futures on the notes fell as much as 0.8%, the most since mid-May.
Analysts expect the central bank will offer some kind of reprieve to the bond market, most likely cutting the amount of funds lenders need to set aside in reserve. That could happen as soon as this month, according to a commentary published Wednesday by a state-run newspaper, which also cited the likelihood of a deposit-rate cut in the third quarter.
The People’s Bank of China pumped trillions of yuan into the financial system earlier this year, driving borrowing costs to multiyear lows. While those policies encouraged lending, they also resulted in rampant arbitrage where corporates borrowed cheaply to buy high-yielding investment products, diverting money away from the real economy. It partly explains why the central bank is not rolling over some funds, stoking one of the worst sovereign bond routs in the world.
Now, the concern is that tighter liquidity in the financial system will lead to higher funding costs and hurt the economic recovery, say  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analysts.
“The sale of the special government bonds is pressuring the already fragile market sentiment, which was hurt by a lack of PBOC easing since May,” said Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc, predicting the 10-year yield will rise to just below 3% in coming weeks. “The central bank will bring forward its plan to cut reserve ratio to this or next month, with the aim of offsetting the liquidity blow.”
The selloff has been fueled by fears that interbank liquidity could quickly dwindle, as China plans to issue 1 trillion yuan ($141 billion) of special government debt by the end of July to combat the impact of the global pandemic. Monday was the first time that China set a timeline for the sale, and said the notes will be auctioned in the public market. Liu said that raised concerns there will be market-wide liquidity tightness.
China’s 10-year debt is the world’s third worst performer since May, following Bulgarian and Pakistani local-currency bonds. The notes have been pressured by tighter liquidity, as local authorities sold the most debt on record in May and banks have sought cash to cope with a massive funding gap this month.
In that time, the central bank has been reluctant to open the spigot: it has put 840 billion yuan into the financial system with short- and medium-term loans to lenders in June, compared with a 2.7 trillion yuan liquidity hole created by maturing policy funds and interbank debt.
Beijing has faced similar pressure recently. China’s government bonds also tumbled in October, sending the 10-year yield to a five-month high, as the PBOC disappointed traders by avoiding aggressive monetary stimulus. The central bank in early November reduced the interest rate on one-year loans to lenders.
It needs to take action soon, as tighter liquidity could start to raise funding costs in the real economy and hurt growth, Citigroup strategists led by Sun Lu wrote in a note. Five-year AA-rated corporate bonds’ yield premium over sovereign notes has jumped by nearly one-third in the past three months, suggesting borrowing costs for cash-hungry smaller companies are climbing.
Offering some comfort to investors, total debt issuance this month and next month may not be as significant as May if one considers both sovereign and local government bonds, according to Sun. The central and regional authorities are expected to sell as much as 1.6 trillion yuan of debt in both June and July, compared with a peak of 1.8 trillion yuan in May, she added. August’s figure is seen easing to 1.4 trillion yuan.
“Liquidity will remain tight in the coming month,” said Xing Zhaopeng, a markets economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Shanghai. “The PBOC will likely loosen its policy at the end of this month when cash supply is the tightest.”

1138,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 09:05PM ET</span>",U.S. unions urge Mexico to defend workers' rights after labor advocate's arrest,"By Daina Beth Solomon
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Pressure is growing for Mexican authorities to release prominent labor lawyer Susana Prieto, arrested a week ago at a protest, with two U.S. unions concerned about a rights clampdown ahead of a new regional trade deal. 
Prieto, who last year helped organize unprecedented strikes at several dozen manufacturing plants in the northern border city of Matamoros, was charged with threats, inciting a riot, coercion and crimes against public servants. She has denied the charges.
With the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) set to go into effect on July 1, U.S. unions are concerned the detention undermines Mexico's pledge to protect workers' rights, a central aim of the trade pact.
Prieto could remain in jail until late July as investigators probe the case, the Tamaulipas state attorney general's office said following her June 8 arrest in Matamoros. A state judge rejected Prieto's requests to be released while the case is pending. 
""This clearly is intended to and will undoubtedly have a chilling effect on workers who are forced to make a life and death decision every day before they go to work under dangerous working conditions,"" United Auto Workers union spokesman Brian Rothenberg said in a statement on Tuesday. 
""It signals a very real challenge for the Mexican government to implement the reforms agreed upon by the U.S. and Mexico under USMCA.""
Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, the largest U.S. coalition of labor unions, called the charges ""trumped up.""
""As we approach entry into enforcement of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Mexico must live up to its commitments to respect fundamental workers' rights,"" Trumka said in a recent statement. 
In his regular news conference last Friday, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he was tracking the matter, but that only state officials could handle the case. He warned against fabricated charges or ""retaliation,"" without providing further detail.
Tamaulipas Attorney General Irving Barrios Mojica said the charges stemmed from a complaint from a labor board in Matamoros about a protest by about 400 workers outside its doors last March. The group was accused of being violent and threatening government workers.
When asked for comment, Mexico's labor ministry told Reuters the case involved criminal charges, not a labor dispute. 
Prieto's daughter Maria Fernanda Peña said in an interview with Reuters on Monday that the group had been calm and had waited hours to request a change of union representation.
""She is a political prisoner. These crimes are not real,"" said Peña, 23. 
Two videos from that day posted by a local news site showed at least several dozen people clustered peacefully at the labor board's front door. 
Prieto does not appear in the videos and Peña said she was not there the full day because she was sick. The attorney general's office insisted that Prieto, who last year founded an independent union, a relative rarity in Mexico made possible by a new law, was present. 
In a handwritten letter posted by her daughter on social media, Prieto urged her ""beloved workers"" - who have turned out in the dozens in recent days to protest her arrest - to maintain their advocacy.

""They want me to plead guilty of crimes I did not commit, but dignity, honor, integrity and pride cannot be bought,"" she said.

The bank’s board, led by its President Mario Marcel, voted unanimously to keep its overnight rate at 0.5% for a second straight meeting, as expected by all 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rate matches the historic low reached during the global financial crisis.
The bank increased a credit line facility to $16 billion to ease lending to companies reeling from the impact of the pandemic and the quarantine measures designed to slow the spread of the disease. Analysts expect the economy to contract 4.8% this year, according to the latest central bank survey, with a 13% contraction forecast for the second quarter. The bank updates all its forecasts in the quarterly monetary policy report released Wednesday.
“The board reiterates that it will maintain elevated monetary stimulus for a prolonged period of time,” the bank said in a statement accompanying today’s decision. “In case the economic events require it, (the bank) will evaluate options to increase said impulse and support financial stability.”
The bank also announced a plan to buy $8 billion in assets. It will provide a detail of eligible assets and the timeline in coming days. The current situation needs more stimulus than what the interest rate can provide, according to Hugo Osorio, deputy head of investment strategy at Falcom Asset Management.
“We don’t know what kind of assets the bank will buy; it could easily be corporate bonds, like the Fed recently announced,” Osorio said. “Lowering spreads and increasing liquidity will help the economic recovery.”
Policy makers moved aggressively in March with two cuts totaling 125 basis points and have injected liquidity into the economy through orthodox and unorthodox mechanisms as a support measure.
As well as the credit line, the central bank is buying back its own bonds and those sold by local banks to increase liquidity in the market. It has also intervened in the foreign exchange spot and forwards markets.

Mauricio Claver-Carone is a Cuban-American with strong anti-communist credentials, a former Treasury official who is hawkish on sanctions and has played a key role pushing measures against Venezuela and Cuba.
""The nomination of Mr. Claver-Carone demonstrates President Trump’s strong commitment to U.S. leadership in important regional institutions, and to advancing prosperity and security in the Western Hemisphere,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement announcing the move.
He said Claver-Carone was well placed to lead the regional development bank at a time of growing challenges to growth and sustainable development exacerbated by sharp increases in novel coronavirus infections across the region.
The United States traditionally nominates the No. 2 official at the IDB. It was not immediately clear what caused the White House to switch gears.
Scott Morris, a fellow at the Center for Global Development, said the move could irritate Latin American countries since the job was normally reserved for a Latin American while an American ran the World Bank.
""You can’t argue in favor of scrapping the old system with a meritocracy if you have a foot in both,"" he said.
“This has always been the position for a Latin American to have a seat on the global stage,” agreed Mauricio Cardenas, former finance minister of Colombia. “It is a small victory for the USA and a great defeat for Latin America.”
Currently a deputy assistant to Trump and senior director for Western Hemisphere Affairs, Claver-Carone worked closely with countries in the region to promote economic development through private sector investments in energy and infrastructure.
He also helped develop the 2018 legislation that led to creation of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation.
He previously served as the U.S. representative to the International Monetary Fund, a senior U.S. Treasury official, and at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

1142,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 04:27PM ET</span>",Powell Plays Down Significance of Move to Buy Corporate Bonds,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell played down the significance of the central bank’s decision to begin buying individual corporate bonds in the secondary market, one day after news of the move helped ignite a rally in bond and stock prices.
Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee to deliver the Fed’s semi-annual report to Congress, Powell said it will not be boosting purchases through its Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility -- an emergency lending program that, to date, has bought only exchange-traded funds.
“We’re not actually increasing the dollar volume of things we’re buying,” he said on Tuesday. “We’re just shifting away from ETFs to this other form of index.” In its announcement on Monday, the Fed said it will follow a diversified market index of U.S. corporate bonds created expressly for the facility in deciding which individual issues to purchase.
Powell defended the Fed’s foray into corporate bonds against accusations it is needlessly intervening in a market that already has dramatically improved from its depths in March.
“I don’t see us as wanting to run through the bond market like an elephant, doing things and snuffing out price signals,” he said. “We just want to be there if things turn bad in the economy.”
The Fed said the index it will use for its purchases “is made up of all the bonds in the secondary market that have been issued by U.S. companies that satisfy the facility’s minimum rating, maximum maturity and other criteria.”
“This indexing approach will complement the facility’s current purchases of exchange-traded funds,” the central bank added.
Fed’s Goal
Powell’s comments suggest the Fed will use a mix of ETF and individual bond purchases based on the index to achieve its goal of improving the functioning of the market. How much it buys overall will depend on how successful it is in achieving that end, the chairman said.
“If market functioning continues to improve, then we’re happy to slow or even stop the purchases,” he said. “If it goes the other way, we’ll increase.”
The Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility is among a number of emergency lending programs the Fed has announced since mid-March aimed at limiting damage to the U.S. economy from the coronavirus pandemic. With a capacity of $250 billion, it has so far invested about $5.5 billion in ETFs that purchase corporate bonds.
Former New York Fed official Krishna Guha said Powell’s comment that the volume of dollar purchases won’t be increased could come as a “negative surprise” to financial markets after they were buoyed on Monday by the Fed’s announcement that it will begin buying individual corporate bonds.
‘Modest’ Purchases?
“We had assumed that the initial single-name purchases would be modest but additional to the existing pace of bond ETF purchases,” Guha, who is head of central-bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a note to clients.
In a back-and-forth with the Fed chairman at the hearing, Senator Pat Toomey echoed some investors in questioning why the central bank is supporting a market that has improved significantly in recent months.
“It’s not clear to me why the Fed needs to be intervening actively in the corporate bond market right now,” the Pennsylvania Republican said.
Powell agreed it is functionally substantially better and a lot of the improvement came with just announcing the formation of the credit facility.
But he said the Fed believed it should deliver on its pledge to aid in that improvement.
“I wouldn’t say it’s the main reason,” he said. “One reason is, though, we feel we need to follow through and do what we said we were going to do.”
“It was out of an excess of caution to preserve these gains for market function” that the Fed acted, he added.

1143,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 04:20PM ET</span>",Fed's Clarida says pandemic could push U.S. inflation too low,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The ongoing coronavirus crisis is dragging inflation down, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida warned on Tuesday, another sign that the U.S. economy may need more help from the central bank and Congress before it can return to health.
Inflation expectations, already low at the start of the recession that began in February, are ""at risk of falling below"" a range consistent with the Fed's 2% inflation goal, Clarida said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Foreign Policy Association in New York.
""I will place a high priority on advocating policies that will be directed at achieving not only maximum employment, but also well-anchored inflation expectations consistent with our 2 percent objective,"" he said. ""Depending on the course of the virus and the course of the economy, more support from both fiscal and monetary policy may be called for.""
Fed policymakers including Chair Jerome Powell have focused most heavily on the need to bring back the millions of jobs lost in the recession. Clarida's remarks suggest that the drag that too-low inflation can exert on growth is equally a concern motivating the Fed's unprecedented support for the economy. That included last week's pledge to continue buying $120 billion of bonds monthly and a signal the Fed plans to keep interest rates near zero for years.
Recently eased financial conditions from the Fed's unprecedented credit and market backstops and willingness to lend freely to much of the economy if needed should help households and firms, he said.
Clarida echoed Powell's view earlier in the day in Congressional testimony that jobs growth in May was a ""welcome"" development. He also agreed with Powell that the economy will resume growth in the third quarter after an expected large decline in the current quarter.
The return to a healthy economy will take ""some time,"" Clarida said.

""Given the unknown course of the pandemic, I expect this will be more of a scenario than a forecast and will also include a discussion of the key risks,"" he said in his opening remarks to a parliamentary committee.
Macklem, who officially took over on June 3, also said that while job growth was expected to accelerate across Canada as more businesses reopen, not all jobs lost to COVID-19 shutdowns would return. Canada has lost millions of jobs since March and the unemployment rate hit a record high in May.
""For now and the foreseeable future, we are focused on providing monetary stimulus and delivering low interest rates to support the recovery,"" Macklem told the committee.
Macklem will preside over the July 15 rate decision, officially his first. The Bank of Canada held its key rate steady in a decision earlier this month, after it slashed rates three times to a record-low 0.25% in March.

1145,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 03:33PM ET</span>",Why some black-owned U.S. businesses are hardest hit by coronavirus shutdowns,"By Katanga Johnson and Jonnelle Marte
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - After 15 years working as a hair stylist in other people's salons, Gary Connell opened his ""Healthy Hair"" studio in Montgomery County, Maryland in early March, sinking his savings into a two-chair shop in a busy mall. 
It hadn't even been up and running for a full month when stay-at-home orders were issued because of the novel coronavirus, shutting down the mall.
Connell, 57, went two months with no income before Maryland loosened restrictions in early June, allowing him to take a limited number of clients. He couldn't access the federal government's small business loan program, or get unemployment insurance. 
His situation isn't unusual. 
U.S. black-owned small businesses are highly concentrated in retail, restaurants and other service industries most affected by shutdowns and social distancing. Their owners typically have had fewer resources to fall back on and a tough time getting aid, research shows. 
Economists are sounding alarms that coronavirus-related damage may be permanent. ""A lot of these business owners that are shut down right now are not going to come back,"" said Robert Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz who wrote a paper about the pandemic's impact on small businesses. 
The number of black businesses owners in the United States dropped by 41% between February and April to 640,000, compared to a 17% drop in the number of white business owners, Fairlie's analysis shows. 
FEWER BUSINESSES, FEWER RESOURCES 
U.S. small businesses are where U.S. jobs are created, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said during congressional testimony on Tuesday, and any wave of insolvencies would weigh on the economy for years. ""That's all the more so true of minority businesses because of the important role they play in our economy and in their communities,"" he said. 
Black business owners are under-represented, making up about 7% of the 15 million small business owners who were working in February before the coronavirus pandemic hit, compared to more than 13% of the U.S. population in 2019, Census data (https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219) show. 
Black-owned businesses also had fewer resources to fall back on when the pandemic struck; some 21% were financially ""distressed"" at the end of 2019 based on their profitability, credit score and earnings, compared to just 5% of white-owned businesses, according to a Federal Reserve survey (https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/medialibrary/FedSmallBusiness/files/2020/covid-brief).
Distressed firms were more likely to use the owner’s personal funds, take on debt or close or sell the business if they faced two months without revenue, the Fed study (https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/medialibrary/FedSmallBusiness/files/2020/2020-sbcs-employer-firms-report) found. 
Minority-owned businesses were less likely to borrow from banks, with only 23% of black-owned businesses having turned to a bank for a loan in the last five years, compared to 46% of white-owned businesses, the survey showed.
Long-standing wealth disparities leave black entrepreneurs with fewer funds to fall back on during the downturn. The typical black family had a net worth of $17,150 in 2016, a tenth of the $171,000 held by white families, according to the Brookings Institution (https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap). 
""That's just not enough money to survive a pandemic when you’re trying to run a business and you have to pay rent, maybe you’re renting equipment,"" said Fairlie. ""You have a lot of costs that don’t just stop during a pandemic.""
Government programs such as the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), haven't always been helpful. 
Only 12% of black and Latino-owned businesses that sought assistance from the federal government received the amount they requested, and 41% were denied, according to a survey by UnidosUS and Color of Change (https://colorofchange.org/press_release/first-covid-19-survey-of-black-and-latino-small-business-owners-reveals-dire-economic-future). 
The government has not collected or released data on PPP loan acceptance overall. 
""The challenges that black-owned business and business owners of color face are not new but they have been exacerbated by this crisis,"" said Tom Feltner, a director of research at the Center for Responsible Lending.
UPSIDE DOWN 
Sage Ali, co-owner of Washington, D.C.'s U-Street restaurant Ben's Chili Bowl, said the family-owned company had been poised to have its best year yet after opening a new location in a casino in Baltimore in March, and being featured in United Airline's in-flight magazine. 
The restaurant's sales dropped as much as 85% in the coronavirus crisis and it failed to get a PPP loan initially, but it did in the second round. ""It's not a lot of money and there are a lot of bills other than payroll and our business is still down more than 50% for sure,"" Ali said.
Many of the restaurant's workers have been too fearful to return to work, and a Virginia location closed altogether, after the nearby area became what Ali called ""a ghost town.""
""We're struggling. Imagine small black-owned businesses that don't have as much time in the game and don't have as much recognition, and it's got to be more challenging,"" Ali said.
Hair salon owner Connell said he and his wife, a personal trainer who was also out of work, faced technical problems every time they tried to apply for unemployment benefits, as have millions of others.
""Everything feels upside down right now,"" Connell said. 
More consumers have been supporting black-owned businesses in the weeks after George Floyd, an unarmed black man, was killed in police custody, sparking protests over racism and police brutality. 
But lack of capital means some firms are struggling to meet the demand. 
Every time Donica Johns, 48, founder of the plant-based skin care brand Natural Mixologist, replenishes her most popular face masks and facial serums, the items sell out within days. 
Johns, who lives in New Orleans, has not been able to restock as quickly as she would like, because she doesn't have the capital reserves to order more ingredients. 
As her company's only employee, she decided not to apply for a PPP loan, but said she could benefit more from a flexible loan to help her rebuild inventory. 

""It's just so hard to get the capital we need,"" said Johns. ""When you're strapped for cash it's a very difficult balancing act.""

1146,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 03:23PM ET</span>",Did elite David Boies law firm get a pandemic bailout? It's a secret,"By Caroline Spiezio
(Reuters) - When the U.S. government announced a multibillion-dollar bailout of struggling small businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic, one of the top U.S. law firms sensed an opportunity.
Leaders of the high-profile firm founded by David Boies circulated an email asking shareholder partners to authorize the firm to seek up to $20 million in forgivable government loans, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Boies Schiller Flexner, where partners commonly earn seven-figure compensation, is known for representing Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein against sexual-assault accusations and companies ranging from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to Theranos.
The firm declined to comment on whether it actually applied for or received the money under the U.S. government’s Paycheck Protection Program. And the government won't say - because of a policy that keeps all such applications and awards secret.
The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), which oversees the program, declined to comment on whether Boies Schiller has applied for a PPP loan. The agency previously told Reuters that it would post individual loan data when its current round of PPP funding runs out. But it did not say whether that data will include borrower names or amounts or detail what it plans to release. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the U.S. Senate's small business committee on Wednesday that borrower names and amounts received would not be made public, calling the information proprietary and confidential. 
Critics say the government is violating public records laws and handing out billions of dollars in taxpayer money with no public accountability.
Several major news organizations, including The Washington Post and The  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT), have sued the SBA in Washington D.C. federal court, arguing that borrowers’ names and loan amounts are legally public. Reuters is not among the plaintiffs. They point out that the SBA has for years released such information on borrowers receiving loans under other programs.
The SBA said on Friday in a court filing that some or all of the documents and information the plaintiffs have requested are exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, without specifying which ones.
Confusion over the program's disclosure rules deepened on Tuesday when Republican Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, tweeted, ""We will have #PPP loan disclosure"" and that there is ""no dispute over larger loan recipients being disclosed."" Rubio is chairman of the Senate's small business committee.
A spokesman for the senator, Nick Iacovella, did not comment on what information Rubio wanted disclosed or whether it would include recipients' names and loan amounts. Iacovella said Rubio ""plans to work closely with SBA and Treasury to ensure enough data is disclosed about the program to determine its effectiveness ... without compromising borrowers' proprietary information.""
The Treasury Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In a statement to Reuters, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, called it “absurd” that the administration is “handing out more than $500 billion of taxpayer funds in secret.”
To apply for a loan, applicants must certify that they need the cash to cover basic needs such as salaries and rent and that “current economic uncertainty makes this loan necessary to support” ongoing operations. With some exceptions, companies have to have 500 or fewer employees to be eligible. 
Companies do not have to pay back the loans as long as they spend the money on eligible expenses. 
PPP loans are capped at $10 million. The two sources, who declined to be identified, said they did not know why Boies Schiller asked its partners about applying for double that amount. Some applicants have sought and received multiple loans by making applications through more than one subsidiary.
The April email from the managing partners seeking partner approval caused concern among some of the firm’s members, the two sources said.
Some partners believed that the firm's leadership had not been transparent about its finances and that it might not need the money, the sources said. Boies Schiller does not disclose its financial information, but last year its shareholder partners earned an average of more than $3 million, according to the American Lawyer.
Managing partners Nicholas Gravante and Natasha Harrison followed up with lawyers who didn't immediately respond to the April email, sources said.
Since the launch of the PPP, some companies, such as Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) and Ruth Hospitality Group Inc, have reported receiving funds in regulatory filings. Both companies have said they will return the money, in response to public backlash against big companies taking the loans even though they have other means of funding not available to small businesses. The SBA has said it will audit loans over $2 million. 
Unlike public companies, which must periodically report on their finances, private law firms have no such requirements.
The coronavirus pandemic has hit many U.S. law firms hard. More than 25 of the 200 top grossing U.S. law firms, according to the American Lawyer, have laid off or furloughed employees since March. The U.S. legal sector lost a net 62,800 jobs from March to May, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Boies Schiller declined to comment on whether and to what extent the pandemic has impacted its finances.
Founded in 1997, Boies Schiller has about 245 lawyers in the U.S. and U.K. according to the firm's website. In 2019 the firm grossed $405 million, according to the American Lawyer. At least some of its partners bill more than $1,000 an hour, a source familiar with the firm said. 
Boies, the firm's chairman, is well-known for representing the U.S. government in antitrust litigation against  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and former Vice President Al Gore in the U.S. Supreme Court case over the 2000 presidential election recount. He more recently advised failed blood-testing startup Theranos and Weinstein, who was convicted of sexual assault and rape in a New York court in February.
The firm's reputation has recently suffered in the wake of media reports that Boies had used aggressive tactics to defend clients, including hiring the Israeli private intelligence firm Black Cube to quash negative publicity about Theranos and Weinstein. It declined to comment on the reports.
Since January, more than 25 partners have left the firm, Reuters has reported, including two top litigators who jumped to another firm last week. Leaders of the firm have said many of the departures are tied to an internal restructuring.

1147,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 03:09PM ET</span>",A Month of Fed Bond ETF Buying and What It Did to Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s fingerprints are all over the bond exchange-traded fund market.
Just a month after the Fed’s buying kicked off, cash is flooding into fixed-income ETFs at a record pace and demand to bet against both high-grade and junk funds has dissolved. Meanwhile, the Fed’s steady purchases have coaxed the price of its chosen ETFs back into alignment with their net-asset values, after those ETFs posted unprecedented dislocations during the height of March’s coronavirus-fueled credit crunch.
The degree to which the fixed-income ETF landscape has stabilized is just another example of how powerful the Fed’s interventions have been in soothing -- and stoking -- financial markets. That dynamic was on display once again Monday, when the central bank’s announcement that it would finally begin purchasing individual bonds boosted BlackRock’s iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE:LQD) Corporate Bond ETF, ticker LQD, to an all-time high. The Fed’s inclusion of bond ETFs in its pandemic response ultimately served as an endorsements of sorts for a segment of the market that’s struggled to make up ground on its equity peers.
Flipping the Leaderboard
The central bank’s pledge rearranged 2020’s leaderboard for ETF flows. Fixed-income ETFs have absorbed roughly $78 billion so far in 2020, with corporate-bond ETFs accounting for roughly $42 billion of those inflows, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rush into bond funds is outpacing inflows into equity ETFs, which total $53 billion year-to-date. It’s a remarkable shift, given that equity ETFs -- which hold $3.2 trillion in assets -- dwarf fixed-income funds, which hold $944 billion.
The newfound interest in fixed-income ETFs is a consequence of the Fed’s purchases, which enticed a new class of investors into the ETF market, according to  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT).’s Rory Tobin.
“There is a increased interest from a lot of investors, particularly dedicated fixed-income investors, who wouldn’t necessarily have been thinking about fixed-income ETFs three months ago, six months ago, given that ETFs are an equity instrument that trade on equity pipes and plumbing,” said Tobin, global head of State Street’s SPDR ETF business. “But we’ve certainly started to see doors being opened, conversations being started with entities that might not have been very ETF-friendly in the past.”
Vanquishing Shorts
Bearish wagers against both investment-grade and high-yield ETFs have shriveled in the wake of the Fed’s backstop. Short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding in LQD -- which has absorbed the bulk of the Fed’s buying -- is just 2.3%, after surging to an all-time high of 17.6% in March, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. For the SPDR Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) High Yield Bond ETF, ticker JNK, short bets are hovering near a four-year low.
While the Fed’s support has been “invaluable” in staving off defaults, investors shouldn’t give a blanket all-clear to the entire asset class, cautions Principal Global Investors.
“Even with Fed help, a bad credit is still a bad credit, and that underlying weakness will inevitably show through when Fed support is removed,” said Seema Shah, the firm’s chief strategist. “So caution is still warranted, and high quality is still preferred.”
NAVs Aligned
One of the Fed’s most masterful feats in quelling market distress was in reuniting bond ETF prices with the value of the funds’ underlying assets. As trading froze in cash bond markets in March, funds such as LQD and the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Bond Index Fund ETF Shares (NYSE:BIV)plunged to steep discounts to their net-asset values as investors shed holdings in the more-liquid ETFs. Those discounts quickly switched to premiums after the Fed announced in late March that would purchase ETFs in late March, as the funds rallied more quickly than the securities that they track.
Now, three months later, prices on bond ETFs are largely back in lockstep with their holdings. Without the Fed’s intervention, the two likely would have met -- but only after the underlying credit markets dropped steeply, said Dan Suzuki of Richard Bernstein Advisors.
“If the Fed had not stepped in, who knows how bad it would have gotten in markets and in the overall economy,” said Suzuki, the firm’s deputy chief investment officer. “Had that continued, the NAVs would have probably dropped dramatically to meet the ETF prices which probably would have gone down further had the Fed not stepped in.”
What’s Next?
The Fed has purchased $5.5 billion worth of bond ETFs through June 9, a fraction of the facility’s $250 billion capacity. With both bond ETFs and the credit market largely back to business as usual -- companies are issuing debt at a record clip -- questions have emerged about how long the Fed’s purchases will last. The central bank said Monday that it could pause buying once market conditions return to pre-pandemic levels, with the option to resume if the situation worsens.
In the eyes of Miller Tabak’s Matt Maley, the eventual tapering of support could disrupt markets.
“When the Fed buys ETFs they are totally insensitive to price, that’s dangerous,” said Maley, chief market strategist. “When a large price insensitive buyer leaves any market, it leaves it very vulnerable.”

1148,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 02:55PM ET</span>","Green shoots welcome but recovery still a long road, Fed's Powell says","By Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Dunsmuir
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A full U.S. economic recovery will not occur until the American people are sure that the novel coronavirus epidemic has been brought under control, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday, as he began the first of two days of hearings before U.S. lawmakers.
While recent signs of improvement including a surprise gain in employment and a record rise in retail sales last month are encouraging, the damage inflicted by forced economic shutdowns to curb the spread of the virus has left a very deep hole to fill, especially on the employment front, Powell said.
""Something like close to 25 million people have been displaced in the workforce, either partially or through unemployment and so we have a long road ahead of us to get those people back to work,"" Powell said. 
Powell's prepared remarks to the Senate Banking Committee largely echoed the cautionary tone he struck last week at the conclusion of the Fed's latest two-day policy meeting, mapping out how the United States faces an uncertain, uneven and prolonged economic recovery from the health crisis.
The Fed kept interest rates unchanged near zero and made clear it plans years of extraordinary stimulus as the nation grapples with reopening its economy amid state and local surges in cases, and with no vaccine in sight.
The central bank currently forecasts the economy shrinking 6.5% in 2020 and Powell admitted on Tuesday that his colleagues ""largely"" did not assume a significant second wave of infections in making that assessment.
Millions of people have become unemployed as a result of the epidemic, which has killed more than 116,000 people in the United States, with minority communities among those hardest hit on both fronts. Powell was repeatedly asked how the Fed could mitigate the impacts of such racial inequality.
""If not contained and reversed, the downturn could further widen gaps in economic well-being that the long expansion had made some progress in closing,"" said Powell, adding the best way the central bank could help was by returning U.S. unemployment to its pre-coronavirus lows.
But he cautioned there would be no quick fix to healing the economy, particularly for low-wage workers in service sector industries that have been hardest hit. 
He repeated that the Fed will use its full range of tools to help the economy recover and renewed calls for lawmakers to provide more fiscal support, which he called a ""critical difference"" in limiting long-lasting damage. He frequently reminded lawmakers that the Fed could lend but not spend, unlike Congress. 
FRAGILE RECOVERY
The Fed warned in its semi-annual report to lawmakers on Friday that it expects households and businesses to suffer ""persistent fragilities.""
""There's a reasonable probability that more will be needed both from you and from the Fed,"" Powell told lawmakers. ""There will be a significant number of people that don't go back to work...those people are going to need help going forward to get back to work.
Powell will appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday at 12 p.m. EDT (1600 GMT) for a second day of congressional testimony. 
Congress has so far allocated nearly $3 trillion in financial relief, including direct payments to households and a forgivable loan scheme for small businesses, while the Fed has implemented numerous programs to pump trillions of dollars of credit into the economy.
Elsewhere in the hearing, Powell was pressed on the efficacy of its various crisis-driven programs designed to improve the flow of credit to businesses across the country, including whether its long-awaited Main Street lending program, launched on Monday, will reach a broad enough range of firms.
""I'm really genuinely concerned that we may see the Main Street lending program not have a material impact on helping small and medium-sized businesses...to me it appears there is little in the program to incentivize banks to originate these loans,"" Senator Jerry Moran, a Republican, said of the program, which will offer up to $600 billion in loans to U.S. businesses with up to 15,000 employees or with revenues up to $5 billion.
""We really had no choice but to go through the banking system to meet those borrowers,"" Powell responded. ""We feel there's substantial interest on the part of bankers for this.""

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>",Fed officials' GDP forecasts not likely factoring second COVID wave: Powell,"(Reuters) - The economic growth projections Federal Reserve officials offered last week by and large do not factor in a potential second wave of coronavirus infections later this year, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday.
Powell's remark came in the first of two days of testimony to Congress, during which he repeated a now-standard mantra that the disease will determine the strength and persistence of any recovery from the recession that began in February. 
That said, it appears a second wave is not his or his colleagues' base case.
At their meeting last week, 17 Fed policymakers provided their first take on where the economy goes next in the wake of the pandemic. The median view called for a full-year contraction in gross domestic product of 6.5% from 2019.
""Does this projection assume a potential second wave of coronavirus and the accompanying economic impacts?"" Senator Krysten Sinema, an Arizona Democrat, asked Powell.
""That number is actually the median of the projections of the 17 participants of the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) so it isn't an official prediction of the Fed,"" Powell said in reply. ""It will be based on different assumptions made by different people. Each of the 17 will have probably made a somewhat different assumption.""
""I would think the answer to your question, though, largely will be that ... my colleagues will not principally have assumed that there will be a substantial second wave.""
""Oh, that's concerning,"" Sinema retorted.
To be sure, the 17 projections cover a wide-range of potential outcomes, the worst of which arguably could take into account a resurgence of COVID-19 in the second half of the year. Policymakers' estimates for the 2020 change in GDP ranged from a low of negative 10% to a high of negative 4.2%.

Still, to Powell's point, the ""central tendency,"" which reflects the weight of estimates, ranged from negative 7.6% to negative 5.5%, which would not appear to factor a substantial drag from any second wave.

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>","As 'ground zero' for crisis, Nevada shows need for fiscal aid: Fed's Powell","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Even as the U.S. economy shows early signs of emergence from the coronavirus recession, the state of Nevada illustrates both why a full recovery may still be years away and why Congress will likely need to deliver more fiscal aid.
""Nevada is ground zero for this, really,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, in the first of two back-to-back appearances before Congress this week.
At 28%, Nevada's unemployment rate is the highest in the country. 
Home to the gambling and entertainment mecca of Las Vegas, much of the state's $169 billion economy is built on travel, entertainment, restaurants, bars, and hotels - all industries hit hard in the pandemic because they rely on large numbers of people congregating, exactly what individuals are loath to do as long as there is no treatment or vaccine for the highly infectious and sometimes deadly novel coronavirus. 
Nationally, the nation's economy has probably bottomed, Powell said on Tuesday, with some economic data, including retail sales, showing unexpected strength in May.
Nearly $3 trillion of fiscal aid passed by Congress in March ""has had a real effect,"" Powell said.
But with a full recovery likely elusive until people are more confident they are safe from infection, places like Nevada illustrate the need for Congress to do more. 
""There are going to be a lot of people going back to work in coming months, but there are going to be a lot of people who can't,"" Powell said. ""If they work in Nevada in the travel and entertainment industry, there just aren’t going to be jobs...some form of support for those people going forward, in my view, is likely to be appropriate."" 

Investment in mass testing, he said in answer to a different question, would also deliver ""very high returns"" for the economy by boosting confidence.

Anger over racism and inequality has swept the country since the police killing of George Floyd May 25 in Minneapolis, with people protesting en masse despite the ongoing threat of infection during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The unrest has sharpened the public focus on economic plight of black and Latino families, who on average continue to earn less, have higher unemployment, and are harder hit when economic shocks like the coronavirus hit. [L1N2DO1NW] In May, while white unemployment fell, black unemployment rose. 
The ""best single thing"" that the Fed can do to address inequality, Powell told the Senate Banking Committee, is to ""try to get the labor market back to where it was in February,"" when unemployment was 3.5%.
But when Senator Sherrod Brown asked Powell for an open-ended study of how the Fed's policies contribute to systemic racism, Powell said he would get back to him after conferring with his colleagues. 
""We do consider racial disparities and things like that as a routine matter in our work now,"" Powell added.

Powell, who had previously condemned racism in U.S. society, said he had sent Bostic an email thanking him for his comments. 
Brown pressed further, asking if the Fed itself is responsible for unequal outcomes. 

""There’s no doubt more that all of us can do to address these issues, and this feels like a time when people are going to be looking for ways to do more, and we certainly are going to be doing that,"" Powell said.

1154,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 12:01PM ET</span>",Trump team prepares $1 trillion infrastructure plan to spur economy,"By Jeff Mason and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - The Trump administration is preparing an up to $1 trillion infrastructure package focused on transportation projects as part of its push to spur the world's largest economy back to life, a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.
The Department of Transportation's preliminary version reserves most funds for projects such as roads and bridges, but will also set aside about a quarter of the money for priorities such as 5G wireless infrastructure and rural broadband, two sources said.
The White House, which has made similar proposals in recent years, is aiming to unveil its latest effort in July, one of the sources said. News of the potential additional stimulus, first reported by Bloomberg, supported a U.S. stock market rise on Tuesday. 
President Donald Trump, a Republican, is running for re-election in November. He is eager to boost the economy to bolster his political prospects after criticism of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the response to protests after the death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis sparked protests worldwide. 
As the economy slowly recovers from the roughly two-month shutdown to limit the spread of COVID-19, the Trump administration is looking at measures to jump-start employment.
The administration proposal would extend the law authorizing highway and other surface transportation funding. The current law, known as the FAST Act, authorized $305 billion over five years and is set to expire on Sept. 30.
The White House is likely to propose a 10-year reauthorization of the measure, which would be the longest-ever surface transportation bill and is set to release its proposal as early as next week, two other people briefed on the matter said.
The White House is not expected to disclose how it intends to pay for the new jump in infrastructure spending. It has repeatedly called for at least $1 trillion in total infrastructure spending over 10 years in line with Trump’s 2016 campaign promise.
Republicans have been voicing concerns about deficit spending after years of downplaying it. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has expressed reservations about a big infrastructure spending bill, and new concerns about debt, especially with the huge cost of the pandemic response, could be a hurdle. 
Democrats on Wednesday in the House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee will debate a $494 billion five-year surface transportation bill that would provide $319 billion to fix 47,000 structurally deficient bridges and make other repairs, $105 billion for mass transit and invest nearly $30 billion in passenger railroad Amtrak and rail infrastructure.
The full House is expected to vote on the measure in early July.
In April 2019, Trump and Democratic leaders agreed to spend $2 trillion on infrastructure, without hashing out a way to pay for it. Weeks later, Trump abruptly canceled a follow-up meeting after criticizing congressional investigations. 

Congress abandoned the practice of largely requiring road users to pay for road repairs and has not raised the federal gas tax since 1993. Since 2008, Congress has transferred about $141 billion in general revenues to the Highway Trust Fund.

Doha filed its complaint in 2018, saying Saudi Arabia was blocking Qatari-owned broadcaster beIN and refusing to take effective action against alleged piracy of beIN's content by ""beoutQ"", a sophisticated pirating operation.
The three-person panel ruled that Saudi Arabia's failure to act against beoutQ was a breach of WTO rules. ""...the Panel recommends that Saudi Arabia bring its measures into conformity with its obligations under the TRIPS Agreement,"" it concluded, in reference to a global pact on intellectual property.
However, the panel also supported Saudi Arabia's view that it could block Qatar's broadcaster from obtaining legal counsel in Saudi Arabia on grounds of national security.
""Qatar comes out ahead overall,"" said a trade official familiar with the ruling.
Qatar described the ruling as a ""resounding victory"" and said that Saudi Arabia needed to respect the rights of high profile sports and entertainment.
""Saudi Arabia has a strong record of protecting intellectual property and is committed to applying its national law and procedures in full conformity with WTO rules,"" Saudi Arabia's mission to the WTO said in a statement.

Riyadh can appeal the ruling although the appeal could fall into a legal void since the WTO's Appellate Body does not have enough judges to handle new cases.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund will likely forecast a worse contraction in the global economy than previously estimated for 2020 and sees ""profound uncertainty"" about the path of recovery, IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath said in a new blog.
Gopinath said the economic crisis triggered by the novel coronavirus pandemic was more global and playing out differently than past crises, with the services sector hit harder than manufacturing in both advanced and emerging market economies, and inflation low across the board.
She also cited a striking divergence of financial markets from the real economy, which could portend greater volatility in financial markets and potentially sharp corrections.
The IMF is due to update its World Economic Outlook on June 24. Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva last month said the Fund was ""very likely"" to revise downward its already pessimistic forecast for a 3% contraction in global gross domestic output in 2020, but gave no details.
Gopinath said there were signs of early recovery in many countries that were reopening their economies, but new waves of infections and reimposed lockdown measures still posed risks.
While fiscal policy measures had been sizable in advanced economies, poor countries had more constrained resources, and the informal sector had not been able to help absorb the shock as it had done in past crises, she said. 
Global cases of the virus reached over 8 million on Monday, with infections surging in Latin America, while the United States and China are grappling with fresh outbreaks.
Gopinath said pent-up consumer demand could fuel a quicker rebound in hard-hit services, but this was not guaranteed since consumers might change spending behavior to minimize social interaction, and uncertainty could trigger higher savings rates.
In China, one of the early exiters from lockdown, the recovery of the services sector was lagging, with the hospitality and travel sectors struggling to regain demand. 

Gopinath said the longer-term impact on tourism-dependent economies was a particular concern, and governments should pursue policies to reallocate workers from shrinking sectors to those with stronger prospects.

1159,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Payment breaks account for 13% of Irish bank loan books: regulator,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Coronavirus-related payment breaks agreed by Irish banks account for 13% of loan books, Ireland's central bank said on Tuesday, adding that households, firms and lenders are significantly more resilient than ahead of the last financial crisis a decade ago.
Ireland's banks agreed to offer three-month breaks in March and will extend them to six months for customers in need of further temporary relief as the Irish economy emerges from its coronavirus lockdown at a slower pace than most of Europe.
In its biannual financial stability report, the Irish central bank said the full transmission of the shock from the lockdown lies ahead, with liquidity pressures likely to evolve into solvency pressures for some borrowers over time.
""COVID-19 will put pressure on banks' financial positions, but improved resilience, supported by recent policy actions, results in a banking system that is now better able to absorb, rather than amplify, such a shock,"" it said.
""The banking system is expected to make losses, the scale of which will depend on the evolution of the virus and the 'scarring' effects of this crisis.""
At the end of May, there were almost 200,000 active breaks across Ireland's five main domestic retail banks, relating to outstanding loan exposures worth 24.9 billion euros, central bank data showed.
Of these, 8 billion euros related to Irish-resident firms, covering almost a quarter of all loans to such firms. A further 10.1 billion euros related to Irish mortgage holders, or 11% of the banks' Irish mortgage portfolio.
The regulator warned that the banking sector has very significant direct credit exposures to the coronavirus shock, with close to two-thirds of commercial lending and half of residential mortgages to borrowers in vulnerable sectors.
That makes the outcome for borrowers beyond the temporary breaks a material consideration for financial stability, it added.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of weary seafarers stuck on ships for many months and unable to go home due to the coronavirus pose a risk to the safe operation of the world's merchant fleet, the UN's shipping chief said on Tuesday.
About 90% of world trade is transported by sea and continued complications with changing over ship crews due to restrictions in some jurisdictions is still affecting supply chains despite an easing of lockdown in many parts of the world.
Kitack Lim, Secretary-General of the UN's International Maritime Organization, said some seafarers had been marooned at sea for 15 months, over the 11 month maximum laid out in a maritime labour convention, which he described as a ""humanitarian crisis"".
""This is now a real safety issue, endangering the safe operation of ships. We cannot expect seafarers to stay at sea forever,"" Lim told a Capital Link digital forum. 
""Governments must allow shipping to continue moving by getting seafarers to their homes, and to their ships to work.""
The International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF), which represents seafarers, told seafarers on Monday that it was no longer acceptable to force crews to work.
""If you have finished your contract, then you have the right to be repatriated. If this is not possible then you would remain on board as a passenger,"" the ITF said.
""The consequences could be that the ship is unable to sail if the manning level is inadequate, but that is not the responsibility of the seafarers.""
Guy Platten, of the International Chamber of Shipping, said the scale of crew changes was huge given 200,000 seafarers on board ships had to be replaced with 200,000 colleagues ashore.

""At this point it's a question of political will,"" Platten said.

Hogan, an Irishman, said last week he was ""exploring the option"" of seeking to become director-general of the WTO, for which nominations run until July 8.
""The Commission decided in agreement with him to apply a certain number of measures, one of which is that he would refrain from public appearances that might distract from the subject at hand,"" spokesman Eric Mamer told a news conference. 
Hogan did deliver a speech on Tuesday to launch a public consultation on the EU's future trade policy and answered only two questions from the compere, neither about the WTO post.
The Commission said it would also adopt the ""four eyes principle"", meaning that Hogan's direct boss, Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, would oversee policy proposals or trade negotiating positions for which Hogan is responsible.
Mamer said Hogan would remain trade commissioner for now and was set, for example, to address members of the European Parliament next month on a planned reform of EU trade policy.
""So it's not at all that there are limits to his activity as commissioner, but simply a certain number of simple precautionary measures,"" Mamer said. 

EU governments last week generally agreed to unite around one candidate for the WTO post, although some member states said they should not rule out supporting a candidate from a like-minded non-EU country.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone bank stocks may have never been cheaper, but many long-term investors remain deeply wary of a sector labelled the ultimate 'value trap' after a decade of scandals and underperformance since the financial crisis. 
With the coronavirus crisis and its damaging economic impact adding to their troubles, the euro zone banking index (SX7E) was worth about 40% less at Friday's close than in 2009, while the broader stocks index (STOXX) had more than doubled.
By contrast, some investors expecting an economic turnaround in the United States have piled back into U.S. bank stocks, despite caution that positive stress test results and lower loan losses will be needed for a sustained rally.
""You now have a whole generation of portfolio managers for whom being underweight on banks has been the trade of the last decade"", Magdalena Stoklosa, head of European banks at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), said of the reluctance to buy and hold the stocks.
This is despite the market capitalisation of euro zone banks being only 40% of their book value, well behind their U.S. peers, which are trading on a ratio of 1, data from Refinitiv Datastream shows.
Although so-called value stocks, firms whose fundamental worth is not reflected in their share price, have lead a recent market bounce, banks are unlikely to follow suit. 
A spike in loan defaults triggered by economies shutting down and forecasts of the worst recession in a lifetime has added to wariness, after years of negative interest rates, rising capital and compliance costs and new rivals.
But because euro zone banks have spent a decade building up their capital ratios, there was no immediate stress when the coronavirus pandemic hit, unlike sectors such as airlines.
And unlike the 2008 financial crisis, when they were the problem, some see banks as having a key role in repairing the extensive economic damage wreaked by the coronavirus pandemic, with most European recovery plans relying on them to channel emergency state-back loans to businesses big and small.
However, this has not yet made them more attractive.
""I do not think that it makes sense to currently invest in this sector"", says Klaus Kaldemorgen, portfolio manager at DWS, noting that profitability was an issue before the pandemic.
(GRAPHIC - Euro zone banks missed the record bull market: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegpbydklvq/Pasted%20image%201592213555777.png)
For many investors, a lack of capital gains in recent years had been somewhat compensated by competitive payouts. But the euro zone banking index's dividend yield slipped to a record low after the European Central Bank told banks to skip payouts and use profits as a temporary additional capital buffer.
""A lot of investors won't touch banking stocks for a very long time"", Martin Moeller, co-Head of Swiss and Global Equities at UBP, said pointing to insurers or pension funds which typically need returns to fund their own liabilities.
(GRAPHIC - Euro zone banks: dividend cancellations last straw?: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklpygwkbpg/Pasted%20image%201592213931222.png) 
While they may have little appeal for long-term investors, euro zone bank stocks are not entirely out of favour.
They are seen as a proxy for trading short term improvements in sentiment, such as the period between mid-May and the beginning of June, when banking stocks surged close to 50%. 
(GRAPHIC - Euro zone banks price to book ratio: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwvkdwrqpm/Pasted%20image%201592214604072.png)
A number of brokers and investments banks saw an opportunity in cyclical shares such as banks after the European Union's plan to launch a massive recovery fund and the ECB's decision to pump its coronavirus pandemic stimulus up to 1.35 trillion euros.
Italian and Spanish banks in particular gained on greater confidence about the euro zone's ability to weather the crisis.
""As a tactical trade, we're still pushing banks"", Edmund Shing, global head of equity derivatives strategy at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), said last week.
But he is only betting on a limited recovery. 

""As banks go up, obviously, we're looking more to cash in than to extend that trade,"" Shing added.

Gross domestic product could return to 2% to 3% growth in the second quarter as factories step up production, Zhang said in a forum held online on Tuesday. 
China's economy shrank 6.8% in the first quarter, the first contraction on record. Highlighting the uncertain outlook, the government did not set a GDP growth target at its annual parliamentary gathering in May.
Zhang still expects the central bank to trim key interest rates, the Medium Lending Facility (MLF) and the Loan Prime Rate (LPR), while cutting the required reserve ratio (RRR) - the amount of cash banks are required to hold - twice in the second half of the year.
The timing of the RRR cuts would probably correspond to the expected issuance of special treasury bills and local bonds to ensure sufficient liquidity, he said.
But he also expressed concern over dwindling overseas orders since April as coronavirus cases started to spread and spike in the rest of the world, with worries rising about a second wave.

Investing.com -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will update Congress on his expectations for the U.S. economy, just as the Fed's latest stimulus action keeps a flagging stock market rally going. U.S. retail sales and industrial production data for May are due, as is the NAHB's house price index. The Bank of Japan has also bolstered its direct lending to companies, and the International Energy Agency says oil demand will bounce back more sharply than it originally thought. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, June 16th.
1. Powell to testify before Congress
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will testify before the Senate Banking Committee in his semi-annual report to Congress on the state of monetary policy, starting at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT).
Powell is set to unveil the Fed’s first new forecasts for the U.S. economy this year, having passed in March due to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic.
He’ll also likely talk up the effectiveness of the Fed’s stimulus, which will gain another leg from today in the shape of direct purchases of individual corporate bonds. The Fed will buy according to an internally-developed index made up of all the bonds in the $9.6 trillion corporate debt market from companies that qualify. The issuer must have had an investment-grade-rating as of March 22 and the securities must have a remaining maturity of less than five years.
The start of New York Fed’s announcement that such purchases will start this week had been enough to ensure that U.S. stocks closed in positive territory on Monday, even though they had clearly been prefigured in the Fed’s announcement of the program in March.
2. Retail sales, industrial production data due
Powell will be testifying against the backdrop of a fresh data dump from the U.S. economy in May. Retail sales, due at 8:30 AM, are expected to have rebounded by 8% in May after their record 16.4% drop in April, with core retail sales rising by a more modest 5.5%. Core sales have fallen for three months in a row – the first time they have done so in eight years.
The retail sales data will be followed by industrial production and manufacturing output figures at 9:15 AM. Industry has rebounded faster than consumption in China, where the virus hit first, but economists expect only a 2.9% increase in output in May.
The National Association of Home Builders will also release its housing market index for the month at 10 AM. That’s expected to rise to 45 from 37 last month.
3. Stocks set to open higher on central bank support
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher, still supported by the Fed’s promise of action to support the credit markets on Monday. There is also chatter of the Trump administration preparing an additional $1 trillion infrastructure spending bill, but given that such stories have popped up repeatedly since before Trump’s election, it’s not clear how much more real the plan is now.
By 6:30 AM ET, the Dow Jones 30 Futures Contract was up 509 points, or 2.0%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract and the Nasdaq 100 Futures contract were both up 1.4%.
Stocks to watch on Tuesday include Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), which reports quarterly earnings, and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which the Financial Times reported as having agreed a major supply deal for cobalt with mining giant Glencore (OTC:GLNCY).
.4. Bank of Japan ups stimulus ahead of other CB meetings
The Bank of Japan increased the size of its direct lending program for corporates to the equivalent of $1 trillion, from an originally announced $700 billion.
The news had little effect on the yen, with traders having priced in such action already. However, it supported risk appetite in overseas markets, bolstering hopes of further central bank action in the course of the week.
In addition to the Fed’s new bond-buying and the BoJ’s action, the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank are both expected to announce fresh stimulus at their regular policy meetings on Thursday. Elsewhere, the European Central Bank's Fabio Panetta hinted that the ECB may follow the Fed in buying the debt of so-called 'Fallen Angels', having so far excluded junk-rated companies from its own corporate debt purchases.
5. IEA sees sharper rebound in oil demand
The International Energy Agency trimmed its forecasts for oil demand destruction this year in its latest monthly report on the global oil market.
The IEA revised up its forecast for average demand by 500,000 barrels a day. It now sees demand falling on average by 8.1 million b/d, rather than the 8.6 million b/d it forecast last month. That’s still the biggest-ever yearly drop since the IEA began compiling its data.
The IEA was also more optimistic about 2021, projecting a 5.7 million b/d increase in demand. That suggests the market will rebalance more quickly than many think, given that supply is likely to be constrained by financial distress in the U.S. shale industry.
U.S. crude futures were up 1.6% at 6:30 AM at $37.72 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 1.7% at $40.40 a barrel."

The European Court of Auditors looked into eight cross-border projects, part of a planned trans-European network, including the Lyon-Turin railway between France and Italy, the A1 motorway in Romania and the Seine-Scheldt waterway between France and Belgium.
It found that some projects ""may not be economically viable"" and traffic forecasts may be over-optimistic.
The average construction time of large-scale transport infrastructure is 15 years, but the average delay for entering into operation has been 11 years, the court said. The Seine-Scheldt link has been delayed the most by 18 years and the Lyon-Turin by 15 years so far.
The cost of the eight megaprojects had increased by more than 17 billion euros, a 47% raise on initial estimates, due to changes in project scope, design or inefficient implementation, auditors found.
The largest cost increase was the Canal Seine Nord on the Seine-Scheldt link where costs are estimated to have risen 199%, or 3.3 billion euros. The Lyon-Turin rail connection is now estimated to cost 9.6 billion euros, an 85% increase from an initial estimate of 5.2 billion euros.
The European Commission is responsible for making sure that EU member states complete the core transport network by 2030. Its supervision had been ""distant and needs to be strengthened"", auditors said.

LONDON (Reuters) - British banks need to accelerate preparations for dealing with businesses unable to repay money borrowed to bridge the coronavirus pandemic, the national financial sector regulator said on Tuesday. 
Over 800,000 businesses have taken out state-backed loans worth around 34 billion pounds ($43 billion)under schemes introduced by the government as lockdowns forced companies to shutter temporarily.
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Chair Charles Randell said some of the debt incurred will turn out to be unaffordable and will need to be tackled fast to avoid dragging on recovery.
""Lenders will need to scale their arrears-handling functions quickly, and invest in training and controls,"" Randell told an online meeting with the chairs of Britain's banks.
""There needs to be an appropriate dispute resolution system, and we are working with the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Business Banking Resolution Service to ensure that there is capacity to deal with the volumes we may see.""
Banks were criticised for being slow initially in building up capacity to dole out loans, sparking complaints from small companies struggling to stay afloat.
""We can't allow this to become a replay of the 2008 crisis where the treatment of some small business borrowers did such serious damage to people and to trust in financial services,"" Randell said.
The pandemic's impact on markets has added to questions about the value of some high cost and risky investment products, including those sold through ""long and expensive distribution chains"", he said.
""We will be saying more about the issue of high risk investments in the near future.""
There is also a need to ""redesign the system"" so that ""polluting firms"" that break the rules pay for the consequences, rather than being mutualised across the industry, he said.

The government expects 2020 GDP to be around 652 billion francs, down from its December forecast for 712 billion francs. For 2021 it now expects a figure of 688 billion francs, down from the previous view of 725 billion francs.
""On a per capita basis the downturn is going to be as bad as the mid-1970s, if not worse,"" said government economist Ronald Indergand. ""It is going to take years to get over this. The economy is only going to get back to its previous level by 2022.""

All 34 analysts surveyed June 12-16 expected the central bank to stick to its current policy rate - the lowest in the world - when it gives its monetary policy assessment on Thursday. 
Some did not expect any change until late 2025, as the SNB faces the high value of the Swiss franc, deflationary risks and sluggish economic growth caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
They also unanimously expected SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan to keep the interest rate on sight deposits, used to put a brake on the franc's rise, at -0.75%. 
""It is likely the SNB will repeat its message that it is committed to doing whatever is necessary to prevent the rise of the franc, including repeating their readiness to cut interest rates if needed,"" said GianLuigi Mandruzzato, an economist at EFG Bank.
""It will take much longer to get out of negative interest rates now than we ever thought before.""
Although the Swiss franc rose in May to its highest against the euro since July 2015, the safe-haven currency has since weakened against the single currency, giving the SNB some breathing space.
Instead of cutting rates, analysts expect the SNB to continue with the currency interventions it has already ramped up this year, along with increased verbal warnings about its possible actions.
""It will be a boring meeting, but after all the recent turbulence boring is good,"" said UBS economist Alessandro Bee. 
""We don't see any change in the next 12 months, the SNB will prefer to keep intervening, which they can turn on and off as necessary.""

1173,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 02:25AM ET</span>",Swiss govt. expects economy to shrink 6.2% in 2020,"By John Revill
ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's economy will shrink by 6.2% in 2020, the government said on Tuesday, the worst downturn in more than 40 years, as the country grapples with the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.
A gradual recovery is expected during the second half of the year provided a massive second wave of the disease along with severe restrictions does not occur, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) said. 
The forecast was a slight improvement from the 6.7% downturn in GDP foreseen by the government's economists in their April statement. 
Still, the downturn would be the worst since 1975, when Switzerland was hit by the aftermath of the oil price shocks, with unemployment forecast to rise to an average rate of 3.8% during 2020.
The sharpest point in the downturn will come during the second quarter of the year, when economic activity will have been affected by the restrictions for the longest period of time, SECO said.
In recent weeks Switzerland has allowed shops and restaurants to reopen, while on Monday it reopened its borders as the country slowly returns to normal.
""Thanks to the rapid decline in Covid-19 case numbers, the health policy measures could be eased somewhat more quickly from the end of April than had been assumed in the most recent forecast,"" SECO said.
""The short-term prospects have therefore brightened compared with the April forecast,"" it added. Still, a limited recovery is expected for the rest of the year with rising unemployment and short-time working reducing consumer spending.
SECO forecast a moderate recovery in 2021, with the underlying economy growing by 5.3% in 2021. This assumed no new round of health restrictions were needed and the scope of additional job losses and company bankruptcies was limited.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan kept monetary settings steady on Tuesday and stuck to its view that the economy will gradually recover from the coronavirus pandemic, signalling that it has taken enough steps to support growth for now.
However, it increased the nominal size of its lending packages for cash-strapped firms to $1 trillion from about $700 billion announced last month.
While the BOJ remains focused on steps to ease corporate funding strains, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may offer hints on how it will deal with longer-term issues such as how to fire up growth and inflation when the pandemic begins to subside.
""Given markets have calmed down and the economy appears to be bottoming out, there's no reason for the BOJ to take action anytime soon,"" said Hiroshi Shiraishi, senior economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Securities.
""Fiscal policy will play a main role in responding to the virus fallout, so the central bank will continue to indirectly help the government by keeping borrowing costs low,"" he said.
In a widely expected move, the BOJ maintained its yield curve control targets at -0.1% for short-term interest rates and 0% for long-term rates.
The central bank also made no major changes to its programmes to ease corporate funding strains, including a lending facility aimed at channeling funds to firms.
Due to the way it is designed, the amount of money to be pumped out via the programmes will reach 110 trillion yen ($1 trillion) if more loans are taken out via government schemes, the central bank said.
That was larger than an estimate of 75 trillion yen made in May, as the government expanded the range of eligible loans under a second stimulus package.
The BOJ is among a host of major central banks that have pumped trillions of dollars into financial systems to support businesses hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
Finance Minister Taro Aso praised the BOJ's money printing, telling reporters on Tuesday the central bank's lending facilities ""undoubtedly led to an increase in money supply.""
Markets have widely expected the BOJ to stand pat after it expanded stimulus in March and April, mainly by boosting asset purchases and creating lending facilities to channel money to companies hit by slumping sales from the pandemic.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a state of emergency in April, requesting businesses to close and citizens to stay home, a move that dealt a severe blow to consumption.
The emergency was lifted in late May, but analysts expect the economy to have contracted more than an annualised 20% in the current quarter, after having slipped into recession.
The BOJ maintained its guarded optimism on the outlook and stressed its readiness to ease policy again if needed.
""Although economic activity will gradually resume, Japan's economy will remain in a severe state for the time being,"" the central bank said in a statement.
""Once the impact of the pandemic subsides, the economy is likely to improve"" due to an expected rebound in consumption and output, as well as the boost from government stimulus, it said.

(Reuters) - The western Canadian province of Saskatchewan is forecasting a C$2.4 billion ($1.77 billion) budget deficit in 2020-21 as it grapples with shocks from the coronavirus pandemic and low oil prices.
""This is a pandemic deficit, not a structural deficit,"" Saskatchewan Finance Minister Donna Harpauer told reporters at a news conference. The province, she added, had been on track to present a balanced budget before the pandemic hit.
""I am confident that as Saskatchewan's economy recovers, our revenues will also recover and we will get back to balance in the coming years without having to cut programs and services,"" she said.
Saskatchewan unveiled a fiscal plan in March that did not contain any of the usual revenue forecasts, citing economic uncertainty because of the pandemic.
Provincial revenues for the 2020-21 fiscal year are forecast at C$13.6 billion, down C$1.2 billion, or roughly 8%, from the previous year. The province said the decline was because of economic shutdowns tied to the coronavirus pandemic as well the oil price shock.
Located in the Canadian prairies, Saskatchewan's economy is heavily reliant on oil, gas and potash revenues. The province is also a significant agricultural producer.
Overall spending is projected to increase by C$1.1 billion to C$16.1 billion, a 7% increase compared with last year. That figure, the province said, includes record spending on healthcare, which is forecast at C$6.18 billion.
Budget 2020-21 estimates the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to be $30 per barrel.

ZUMPANGO, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexico's economy has virtually ground to a halt and is bleeding jobs in the pandemic lockdown, but tens of thousands of workers at a flagship government airport have not skipped a beat, toiling around the clock north of Mexico City to keep it on schedule.
When the government ordered non-essential activities to close and workers in those industries to stay home to stem the spread of the coronavirus, an exception was made for President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's priority infrastructure projects.
Those include the $3.5 billion Felipe Angeles airport being built on the Santa Lucia military base, an $8 billion refinery at the Gulf coast port of Dos Bocas, and the so-called Maya Train, a 1,470-km (913-mile) rail line that will connect tourist hot spots from Chiapas state to the Yucatan Peninsula along the Caribbean coast.
Firms producing steel, cement and glass - used by those projects - were also allowed to continue operating. On June 1 automotive, aerospace, mining and construction companies were allowed to reopen.
""To date we have created more than 26,000 jobs,"" said Major Jose Juan Marin, construction engineer and spokesman for the Santa Lucia Army Corp of Engineers, which has nearly 1,000 of its ranks managing the project.
On a cloudy day earlier this month, thousands of workers in orange high-visibility vests and hard hats, as well as a newcomer to construction sites in times of pandemic, face masks, were busy building offices, putting up giant steel structures for the passenger terminal and smoothing out the surface of one of two 4.5 kilometer (3.8 mile) runways.
Marin says there has not been a coronavirus outbreak due to the safety protocols put in place, including taking workers' temperature, the use of masks, and having half of office employees work remotely.
Lopez Obrador says the projects are a much needed boon to the economy and an important source of employment. Critics counter that those resources would be better used tackling the coronavirus crisis and boosting the economy.
""Without a doubt the main priority is stopping or overcoming the health crisis and to this end we need to find all the available resources,"" said Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a three-time presidential candidate and son of former president Lazaro Cardenas. 
""I'd even say think about deferring the megaprojects and using those resources."" 
Powerful industry lobbies say the projects do not make up for the lack of a government stimulus package to keep firms from going under and letting workers go. Latin America's second largest economy is seen contracting 10% or more this year.
A survey conducted by the National statistics agency INEGI found that 12.5 million formal and informal jobs were lost in April alone. And industrial output posted a record contraction, tumbling 25.1% in April from March and plummeting 29.3% year-over-year, as measures put in place to halt coronavirus contagion dragged down construction, manufacturing and utilities.
Lopez Obrador ordered the new hub to be built on a military base to save money after he canned a $13 billion Mexico City airport project championed by his predecessor, arguing it was too costly and tainted by corruption.
Critics say the cheaper and more distant airport will condemn the metropolis of more than 20 million inhabitants to a fate of never-ending flight delays and cancellations.
But it could at least be built on time. Eight months after breaking ground, the airport project which will initially have an annual capacity of 20 million passengers is a fifth complete and on track for completion for March 2022.

""We're going to make good on that date without any problem,"" said Marin.

The Fed will use an indexing approach when making purchases, aiming to create a portfolio that is based on a broad, diversified market index of U.S. corporate bonds. 
The purchases will complement the other asset purchases made by the SMCCF, which began buying shares of broad-based exchange-traded funds in mid-May. 
Stock markets rose on the announcement on Monday afternoon after the news boosted investor confidence.
The corporate bond purchases will be based on an index that is ""made up of all the bonds in the secondary market that have been issued by U.S. companies that satisfy the facility’s minimum rating, maximum maturity, and other criteria,"" the Fed said on Monday.

Roughly half of an eligible 73 low income countries have applied for the G20's COVID-19 crisis Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI).
A number of African governments are requesting an extension of the period beyond the end of 2020, to possibly 2022, but there has also been pressure for more private sector involvement (PSI) beyond a pledge in May of ""case-by-case"" help.
""The lack of support from the private sector under the current DSSI would have disappointed G-20/Paris Club countries, and as a consequence they may make private participation mandatory for any country looking to postpone debt service obligations beyond 2020,"" JP Morgan analysts said in a note.
The G20 debt standstill offer is open to the world's poorest and least-developed countries, as defined by the World Bank and the United Nations, provided they are current in their debt service payments to the World Bank and the IMF.
Some countries have been reluctant to seek such relief out of concern it could harm their credit ratings and access to international capital markets.
Big multilateral lenders, such as World Bank and the African and Asian Development Banks, which have provided roughly a third of low income African countries' $325 billion external debt, are also in the G20 spotlight to provide relief.
They too are wary about losing their top credit ratings if their coveted ""preferred creditor"" status is undermined, but JP Morgan, whose analysis is closely followed by debt markets, suggested there could be a workaround.
""The multilateral agencies could explore an arrangement where eligible countries pay debt service as scheduled, in the understanding that those funds are immediately re-disbursed to the paying country,"" it said, adding that could limit the risks.
The Jubilee Debt campaign has estimated the cancellation of poor countries' debt payments, including to private creditors, would free over $25 billion for the countries this year, or $50 billion if extended through 2021.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. economy will experience a ""significant, historic"" contraction in the second quarter before it starts to rebound, and unemployment will remain elevated at the end of 2020, Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan said on Monday. 
Kaplan said he projects that gross domestic product will drop by an annualized rate of 35% to 40% in the second quarter and that it should start to recover in the second half of the year. 
He said the economy may recover more quickly if consumers and businesses take precautions to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
""If people wear masks widely, if we have extensive testing and contact tracing, if businesses and us as individuals follow good procedure, we’re going to grow faster,"" Kaplan said during a virtual discussion organized by the Money Marketeers of New York University.

U.S. Federal Reserve officials need to continue discussing the possibility of using yield-curve control, in which the central bank would target interest rates at specific maturities, Kaplan said. Bond market players are increasingly convinced one of the Fed’s next moves will be to cap yields at a specific point on the curve.

(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Monday launched its latest life raft for U.S. businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic.
Administered by the Boston Fed, the Main Street Lending Program will offer up to $600 billion in loans through participating lenders to small and medium-sized businesses that were in strong financial shape before the crisis.
Here is an overview of the program and how it varies from other aid available for small businesses:
How do Main Street loans compare to the Paycheck Protection Program?
The biggest difference between the Main Street Lending Program and the Paycheck Protection Program is that Main Street loans cannot be forgiven. 
PPP loans can be converted to grants if businesses meet certain requirements, but Main Street loans must be repaid. 
Which businesses are eligible for Main Street loans?
The Main Street program is open to U.S. businesses with up to 15,000 employees or with revenues up to $5 billion. PPP loans are only available to businesses with fewer than 500 employees. 
Can businesses apply that have received help from other programs?
Businesses that receive PPP loans or economic injury disaster loans can still apply for funding through the Main Street program. However, companies that participate in the Fed's primary market corporate credit facility, which will purchase debt directly from issuers, cannot receive Main Street loans. 
Where can businesses apply for Main Street loans?
Borrowers can apply for Main Street loans from lenders participating in the program, including banks and credit unions. 
The Fed will then purchase 95% of the loan. Banks can set their own underwriting standards and may set additional requirements beyond those set by the Fed. 
How much can businesses borrow?
Main Street loans can range from $250,000 to $300 million. 
How quickly do loans have to be repaid?
Main Street loans have terms of five years, and no payments on principal or interest will be due during the first two years. There is also no penalty for businesses that pay their loans off early.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday he would talk to Congress about proper oversight of $660 billion in small business economic relief, after previously resisting calls to reveal who received the funds.
Mnuchin tweeted he would discuss oversight of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) with lawmakers in attempt to balance disclosure with ""appropriate protection of small business information.""
Earlier this month, Mnuchin told lawmakers that revealing which businesses received PPP loans and for how much could be ""confidential"" and ""proprietary,"" in part because the loan amounts are determined by how much a business pays employees.
But the resistance was met with blowback from both Republicans and Democrats, who said it is difficult to appropriately guide government aid during the pandemic without knowing where the money is going. Furthermore, they added the public has a right to see where taxpayer dollars are spent.

""Given the many problems with the PPP program, it is imperative American taxpayers know if the money is going where Congress intended - to the truly small and unbanked small business. The administration’s resistance to transparency is outrageous and only serves to raise further suspicions about how the funds are being distributed and who is actually benefiting,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, in a statement Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police have opened a broader discussion about racial inequality in the United States.
The U.S. civil rights movement in the 1960s was a watershed when it came to formal de-segregation in housing, education, the workplace and public spaces. But more than a half century later, stark divisions remain in how the benefits of a $20 trillion economy are distributed among the largest racial and ethnic minorities and the country's white majority.
An array of government programs has attempted to address the issue, including anti-poverty efforts, affirmative action to boost college enrollment, and preferences in contracting for minority-owned businesses.
But black and Latino families on average continue to earn less, have higher unemployment, and are harder hit when economic shocks like the coronavirus hit.

Some Fed officials have pointed to deep-seated racism as drag on the U.S. economy.
""By limiting economic and educational opportunities for a large number of Americans, institutionalized racism constrains this country's economic potential,"" Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on Friday, calling for an end to racism as both a moral and economic imperative. 
""The economic contributions of these Americans, in the form of work product and innovation, will be less than they otherwise could have been. Systemic racism is a yoke that drags on the American economy.""
The lack of progress after so many decades has led some to argue that a massive generational transfer, sometimes referred to as reparations, is needed to undo a legacy that has roots in slavery, but continued to compound through the era of formal segregation and beyond.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz will ask parliament to increase new borrowing by a further 62.5 billion euros ($70.5 billion) to a record 218.5 billion this year for measures to boost recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, two people familiar with the plans said on Monday.
The plan, to be presented in Scholz's second supplementary budget in three months, underlines Germany's shift from Europe's austerity champion to one of the biggest spenders in the euro zone's efforts to rebound from the pandemic.
Germany's debt-to-GDP ratio will jump to around 77% in 2020 from just below 60% in 2019, and the overall public sector budget deficit will be 7.25% of GDP this year, the two officials said on condition of anonymity. Berlin recorded a budget surplus of 1.5% last year.
Reuters last week cited a senior official as saying that Germany's overall new borrowing would probably balloon beyond 200 billion euros this year,
The finance ministry is drawing up a debt settlement plan under which Berlin would repay up to 8 billion euros net per year over 20 years starting from 2023, Merkel's chief budget lawmaker Eckhardt Rehberg told Bild newspaper.
Scholz is expected to present his new spending plan on Wednesday after discussing it with the cabinet.
Germany is planning stimulus measures worth more than 130 billion euros overall, and a draft of the second supplementary budget seen by Reuters showed that the finance ministry plans to spend 103 billion of that this year, and the rest in 2021.

Among the measures are a temporary cut in value-added tax, cash handouts for parents, funds to rescue small firms from bankruptcy, bigger incentives to buy electric cars and cash injections to stabilise the social security system.

(Reuters) - The U.S. mattress business has bounced back after months of shutdowns from the coronavirus pandemic kept customers away.
Sales at Holder Mattress Co. were up about 30% last month, compared to a year ago, after the company started letting people back into its two northern Indiana stores, said Lauren Taylor, president and granddaughter of the company's founder.
""There's either a lot of pent up demand"" for bedding, she said, ""or people are looking at spending money at home, since they can’t spend it on things like vacations.""
Holder is one of several small businesses Reuters is tracking through this downturn and the now-nascent recovery. Millions of small businesses in the U.S. face an uncertain future after the novel coronavirus pandemic shut down shops, restaurants, schools and travel in the world's biggest consumer economy.
Taylor said the company has adapted to rules and restrictions she never imagined before the crisis. When she first reopened a month ago, for instance, Taylor required customers to make appointments to shop, so they could control who was in the store and sanitize surfaces between every shopper. 
Indiana moves to the fourth phase of its reopening on Friday, when retail stores can operate at full capacity. Taylor said she'll allow multiple shoppers then, adding ""we won’t turn anybody away."" 
Another key part of her business, home delivery, is still facing restrictions. To limit potential exposure for her workers, for instance, she requires buyers to have just one person in the home in contact with the delivery crew, and for that person to fill out a health questionnaire ahead of time.
Last month's strong sales are a bright spot for Taylor, but she's still nervous about the months ahead.
The company received just over $100,000 from the Payroll Protection Program, a federal program aimed at keeping people employed through the shutdowns. Taylor never laid off any of her nine employees.
Taylor said the PPP funds will run out this week and she's confident she'll get the loan forgiven by submitting detailed records of how she spent the money. The program specified that most, but not all, of the funds be used to keep workers employed. ""We've documented more than necessary,"" she said, adding the spread sheet she received from her bank doesn't require the detailed breakdown of spending she's accumulated.
She’s also been approved for a $282,600 Economic Injury Disaster Loan. That’s a 30-year loan with a 3.75% interest rate, which she said will give her company an important buffer.
The biggest surprise so far has been customers' attitudes about masks, she said. 
Customers at their store in Carmel, Indiana, a 95,000 population upscale suburb of Indianapolis, have happily donned face coverings, she said, while many customers at her Kokomo, Indiana, store balked. Kokomo is a 58,000 population, blue-collar city.

With the state's new reopening guidelines, that will no longer be an issue, Taylor said. ""Masks will go from recommended to optional - we will no longer press people to wear them,"" she said, though staff will continue to be masked for the near term.

1190,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: South Africa hopes to ease access to COVID loans amid low payouts,"By Emma Rumney
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African banks and the government are looking for ways to boost take up of an up to 200 billion rand ($11.58 billion) loan scheme to help coronavirus-hit businesses, two bank executives and a source close to the discussions told Reuters.
Possible amendments being discussed include encouraging banks to ease their lending conditions, the source close to the discussions said.
""There are minor issues around the design,"" the source continued, including wording in the terms that has led to banks applying their standard credit procedures and rejecting more applications than anticipated.
The scheme, launched in May, was meant to encourage banks to lend more, on more favourable terms, to small businesses struggling with the effects of the pandemic.
But concerns arose that the money -- 40% of President Cyril Ramaphosa's 500 billion rand economic stimulus package -- was not being fully used after big banks approved only a few billion rand of loans in the first few weeks.
Lenders, the treasury and the central bank are in regular talks on the issue, the source said, with finance minister Tito Mboweni keen to announce changes to the scheme in his emergency budget on June 24.
Goolam Kader, business banking managing executive at Nedbank (J:NEDJ), said the lender is working closely with the Banking Association South Africa (BASA) to identify potential improvements.
He added that Nedbank did not apply credit criteria that are different from usual when assessing loan requests made under the scheme, but that various factors affected take up, including its other efforts to help customers.
Standard Bank (J:SBKJ) referred Reuters to BASA, which declined to comment. FirstRand (J:FSRJ) and South Africa's treasury did not provide comment by a deadline.
Jaco le Roux, chief risk officer of relationship banking at Absa's (J:ABGJ) retail and business bank, said it did apply different criteria as well as imposing requirements like a bond over property less often.
Other features being discussed include raising the turnover threshold for eligible companies from 300 million rand, expanding the list of things businesses can spend the money on and the type of loans banks can extend, and lengthening the term of payment holidays, le Roux and the source said.
Take up has already accelerated to around 7 billion rand and could double within days, the source continued. There may have been a lag as businesses considered their options.
Stuart Theobald, chairman of Intellidex, which presented to government on how to design a scheme, said it did not seem to be working as intended, citing issues like the banks often requiring personal guarantees for the loans, as is standard in South Africa.

""This is not meant to be banking as usual,"" he said. ""You want banks to behave as if they are in the best of times ... but the design of it is such that they can't actually do that.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve said on Monday it had opened registration for lenders interested in participating in its Main Street Lending Program, launching arguably the most complex program undertaken yet by the U.S. central bank to help keep the backbone of the economy from buckling under the strains of the coronavirus pandemic.
The program, targeted at companies that were in good shape before the pandemic but may now need financing to retain workers and fund operations, will offer up to $600 billion in loans through participating financial institutions to U.S. businesses with up to 15,000 employees or with revenues up to $5 billion. 
Lenders must register using the lender portal https://mainstreet.frb.org/s/login/?ec=302&startURL=%2Fs%2F and are encouraged by the Fed to begin making program loans ""immediately."" 
Administered by the Boston Fed, the program aims to offer credit to companies that may be too large to qualify for help from the Paycheck Protection Program, which targets businesses with fewer than 500 employees. Unlike the PPP, which was established by Congress in late March and offers loans that can be converted to grants if businesses meet certain requirements, the loans offered by the Main Street program must be repaid. 
It has taken nearly three months for the Fed to design, build and launch a program to extend credit to companies in all walks of the economy, a huge departure from its role as a lender to the banking sector.
Fed officials adjusted the Main Street program twice by expanding the range of loan sizes to make it available to more companies that need help keeping workers on staff. It also extended the loans to five years, with payments deferred for the first two years, to better help businesses struggling because of the crisis.
""Supporting small and mid-sized businesses so they are ready to reopen and rehire workers will help foster a broad-based economic recovery,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement last week after the most recent adjustment.

The central bank said it will be transparent about the lenders and borrowers participating in the Main Street program, reporting the names of lenders and borrowers, the amounts borrowed and interest rates charged, along with other details. Companies that borrow through the program will also be subject to limits on executive compensation, stock buybacks and dividend payments.

Ireland attracted record high demand last week at a sale of 10-year bonds, helping it close in on an annual funding target that was revised significantly higher just two months ago to shore up government finances after the coronavirus pandemic.
Ireland expects the disruption to turn last year's budget surplus into a deficit of up to 10% of gross domestic product this year and the government intends to borrow heavily to revive what was Europe's fastest growing economy before the pandemic.
""From a borrowing perspective the NTMA (National Treasury Management Agency) is not worried about the next four years. It is the decade after that we need to keep an eye on and begin to plan for,"" Conor O'Kelly told a news conference.
""Ireland should prepare for dealing with a higher debt burden and the risks that this entails. It's possible the tailwinds that exist today will be replaced with headwinds in the future.""
Crediting European Central Bank policy, O'Kelly said it is very likely sovereigns will be able to issue at favourable rates ""for some time to come"". The NTMA was not planning to go beyond its 20-24 billion euro borrowing target for 2020, he added.
The NTMA oversees Ireland's investment-focused sovereign wealth fund which the state has mandated to invest 2 billion euros directly into larger firms in need of funding due to the shutdown of the economy that is being slowly unwound.
Some 30 firms, which the NTMA said included many ""critical employers"" in hospitality, tourism, retail and transport have enquired about funding. O'Kelly said it was encouraging that not many had been so hard hit that they needed funding urgently.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Democratic senators on Monday asked U.S. Defense Secretary Mike Esper what happened to $1 billion in aid for Afghanistan the Trump administration said it would cut nearly three months ago, according to a letter reviewed by Reuters.
Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, demanded Esper explain whether the funds had been cut and if so from which accounts.
""Will the execution of such funding cuts impact the U.S. military presence on the ground in Afghanistan?"" they asked in the letter, requesting a reply by June 26.
""If the administration has determined that this cut in security assistance does not diminish our ability to pursue our national security objectives, what conditions have changed to create such a sizeable surplus?"" they added.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the reduction on March 23 to try to force Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his political rival Abdullah Abdullah to end a feud that had helped stall U.S.-led peace-making efforts in Afghanistan.
Ghani and Abdullah on May 17 signed a power-sharing deal, raising questions whether Washington would reduce the funding.
After nearly two decades of fighting the Taliban, the United States is looking to extricate itself and to achieve peace between the U.S.-backed government and the militant group. But despite the pact between Ghani and Abdullah, peace talks between the government and the Taliban have yet to occur.
Reuters reported on April 5 the reduction would come from funds for Afghan security forces and, on May 20, that the Pentagon had not withheld the money despite Pompeo's March 23 vow to cut it ""immediately.""
On June 1, U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad said he thought the money had been cut and referred questions to the Pentagon.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the letter.

The 31 participants in the poll were unanimous in predicting no change in the policy rate when the outcome is announced on June 18, in line with Norges Bank's view that tightening is most likely years away.
Fearing a collapse of the economy amid the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, Norges Bank slashed its policy rate twice in March - first by 50 basis points to 1.0% and then by 75 points to just 0.25%.
Last month, defying most expectations, Norges Bank opted for a third cut, but said it did not intend to follow the central banks of the euro zone, Switzerland, Denmark and others into negative rates.
""In short, we expect the central bank to reiterate its forecast for the policy rate, implying that it stays at zero until the end of 2023,"" Handelsbanken said in a note to clients.
""Despite positive signs, it is too early to conclude the outlook has changed materially,"" it said.
Others predicted that Norges Bank's revised forecasts could indicate a slightly earlier rise in rates than was foreseen last month.
""Although we have more information since May, Norges Bank will emphasise that uncertainty surrounding economic developments ahead is still unusually high,"" Nordea Markets said.

""We see some potential for a higher rate path towards the end of the forecast horizon as the outlook does not seem as bleak as in May,"" Nordea said.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1 trillion wealth fund could blacklist more companies from its investments, including those that make machine-controlled weapons, if proposals on Monday to modify its mandate are adopted, the head of a government-appointed commission said.
The fund should have a wider definition of corruption and of human rights abuses when considering whether to exclude a company from its investments on those grounds, the group said.
It should also stop investing in firms that manufacture lethal autonomous weapons, a new type of weaponry often nicknamed ""killer robots"", because the machine, rather than a person, decides whether to fire on a target. 
""We signal that all human rights breaches, if they are gross and systematic, will be assessed,"" the head of the commission, Ola Mestad, told reporters. ""For the corruption risk criterion, gross economic crime should now be included.""
""This will probably lead to more exclusions,"" if the recommendations were adopted by parliament, Mestad later told Reuters.
The proposals will be sent for hearing, with the government planning its own proposals for next spring.
The fund does not invest in companies that produce tobacco and nuclear weapons or cause severe environmental damage, among other things.
As the fund holds about 1.5% of globally listed shares, its decisions are closely watched and often followed by other investors. 
In May the fund excluded some of the world's biggest commodities firms from its portfolio for their use and production of coal and relinquished its investments in four Canadian oil firms for producing an ""unacceptable"" amount of greenhouse gas. 
The commission also recommended creating a new reason for excluding a company: if it sold weapons to a state involved in an armed conflict where there is an ""unacceptable"" risk the weapons are used in military operations violating international humanitarian law. The breach must be ""serious and systematic"". 

""Yemen is a conflict for which this could be on the agenda,"" said Mestad.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's central bank is expected to cut its benchmark interest rate by a deeper-than-usual 100 basis points on Friday, as the economy plunges into recession due to still-low oil prices and a lockdown aimed at curbing the spread of the new coronavirus.
Nineteen analysts and economists in a Reuters poll of 31 experts said they believed the central bank would cut its key rate to a record low of 4.5% .
""We expect the central bank to cut the key rate by 100 basis points at the next meeting as there is no speed-up in inflation,"" said Sergey Konygin, chief economist at Gazprombank.
Governor Elvira Nabiullina has openly said the board will consider cutting rates by 100 basis points on June 19, among other options.
That would make lending cheaper and may lessen the economic contraction after the coronavirus pandemic, which has battered business and consumer activity. A partial lockdown across Russia has capped the risk of inflation substantially overshooting the central bank's 4% target.
But lower rates are unlikely to have a strong direct impact on the economy's post-pandemic recovery, analysts said.
Ten analysts predicted a 50-basis-point cut to 5%, while two others said the central bank would cut the key rate by 75 basis points to 4.75%. 
Market expectations that Russia will cut rates have already sparked a rally in Russian OFZ government bonds, popular among foreign investors. Lower rates drive down bond yields, which move in the opposite direction to their prices.

Friday's rate decision is due at 1030 GMT and will be followed by an online media conference with Nabiullina, who is expected to shed more light on the monetary policy outlook and present new economic forecasts.

LONDON (Reuters) - Three Greece-based shipping firms said they have halted trade with Venezuela after the United States imposed sanctions on vessels under their management, as Washington ramps up commercial heat on Caracas.
The U.S. government is seeking to choke Venezuelan oil exports to starve the government of socialist President Nicolas Maduro of its main source of revenue. Existing sanctions have cut Venezuelan exports sharply, but Maduro has held on.
Washington may tighten sanctions by adding dozens more tankers to an existing blacklist, sources told Reuters.
The U.S. Treasury said on June 2 it had imposed sanctions on four shipping companies for transporting Venezuelan oil.
Athens-based Dynacom Tankers Management, which manages the Chios I tanker, among the ships blacklisted, said in a statement on Monday it was ""committed to refraining from any future business involving Venezuela"".
It added that the tanker's owner Seacomber Ltd, which Washington also designated, was co-operating with U.S. authorities to resolve the matter.
NGM Energy SA, which manages another vessel blacklisted, the Voyager I tanker, said separately on Friday that it had implemented ""a strict policy against servicing vessels intending to call at Venezuela or to load cargo of Venezuelan origin in the future, absent express U.S. authorization"".
It said as a result, another tanker under its commercial management, the Commodore, had been ""immediately diverted away from Venezuela, and will not return to that trade"".
NGM added that it was fully cooperating with U.S. authorities to reach ""a timely resolution"" of the sanctions against the Voyager I and its owner Sanibel Shiptrade Ltd.
Another leading Greek ship firm, Thenamaris, said it was fully cooperating with U.S. authorities to resolve sanctions against the Seahero tanker that it manages and the vessel's owner Adamant Maritime Ltd.
Thenamaris said it had ""adopted a firm policy prohibiting any carriage of crude oil from Venezuela for its vessels under management for as long as U.S. sanctions against Venezuela remain in place"".

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India's interventions in the foreign exchange market have helped reserves climb to a record $501.7 billion in early June, but economists say the pace of increase is likely to taper in the second half of this fiscal year.
The RBI bought a total $45 billion in the foreign exchange market in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, while reserves have climbed a further $25 billion since the beginning of this fiscal year.
Some of the recent surge has been driven by the RBI's moves to mop up dollar inflows from  Reliance Industries  ' (NS:RELI) recent stake sales in its digital unit, Jio Platforms. Reliance has raised some $13.72 billion in the last eight weeks via deals with Facebook (O:FB), KKR & Co (N:KKR) and others.
""Given that the money market surplus is running at a high 6.8 trillion rupees, the RBI will likely not want to inject further liquidity through FX operations,"" Indranil Sen Gupta, economist with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities, wrote in a note.
Dollar buying intervention by the RBI pushes rupees into the banking system, which it has historically mopped up via open market bond sales.
With state and central governments scheduled to borrow a combined 19.5 trillion rupees in FY21, ICICI Securities Primary Dealership predicts the RBI will need to absorb anywhere between 3 to 6 trillion rupees worth of the supply to keep yields from spiking sharply.
""The focus of liquidity accretion may switch from FX to domestic OMOs (open market operations) in the latter part of the year,"" said Sameer Narang, chief economist at Bank of Baroda.

Shops in England reopened on Monday, an important step in a probably slow recovery. Below are some of the options for Sunak, who has already rushed out an estimated 133 billion pounds ($167 billion) of emergency spending and tax cuts.
He is expected to announce new ways of helping the economy later this month or in July followed by a budget statement in the autumn.
REDUCING THE TWO-METRE RULE
The government is reviewing its two-metre social distancing rule in England which many employers - especially in the hospitality sector which might reopen in July - say is a big hurdle to getting back up to speed.
Sunak said on Sunday that three quarters of pubs could reopen with a shorter distance requirement, compared with about one third with a two-metre rule. 
But he stressed the government would move ""safely and slowly"" with any changes.
CUTTING VAT TAX
Britain temporarily cut value-added tax in 2008 during the global financial crisis, and Germany will do the same from July 1 for six months. Sunak suggested he was open to the idea but would first need to see how quickly consumers resumed spending.
""Before we have that conversation we need to actually reopen those sectors. There's no point in cutting VAT on a sector that is actually closed,"" Sunak said.
DOUBLE DOWN ON INVESTMENT
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he wants to double down on his pre-crisis plans to ramp up public investment in infrastructure, broadband and training. 
Last year Johnson committed to increasing investment spending by 20 billion pounds annually, a figure that has been dwarfed by Britain's response to COVID-19.
HIRING INCENTIVES, SKILLS
Johnson and Sunak say employers need help to hire workers. 
The Sunday Telegraph newspaper said they were considering an increase in a tax incentive for small firms to hire workers, as well as a suspension of social security payments by employers.
Johnson said this month that he wanted every young person to be guaranteed an apprenticeship.
GREEN INCENTIVES
The Confederation of British Industry has urged the government to offer incentives to consumers to buy electric cars and reduce carbon emissions from homes.
MORE TAX CUTS 
The CBI has also asked the government to exempt all mid-sized companies from business rates - a property tax - something it did in March for the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors for a year.

Most were traced to a popular fruit and vegetable market. The authorities responded by placing nearly a dozen residential districts in lockdown.  
Chinese data released on Monday also showed the lasting economic scars of the pandemic. May retail sales were still down 2.8% from a year earlier, worse than the 2% drop expected. Industrial production was up 4.4% from a year ago, but that was also short of the 5.0% increase expected.
Elsewhere in Asia, the Japanese capital Tokyo also registered its highest daily number of new cases, 47, since May 5, most of them traceable to nightclubs and bars that had recently reopened.
2. Dollar steadies, advances against emerging currencies
The dollar recovered its footing, gaining against risk-sensitive currencies on the back of the news out of China.
The dollar index that measures the greenback against a basket of developed market currencies rose as high as 97.38 before stalling and retracing to 97.175 by 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), down 0.2% on the day.
The buck was stronger against risk-sensitive currencies, including almost all emerging currencies. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, meanwhile, dipped as low as 0.65%.
3. Stocks set to open lower
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower in response to the medical and economic news out of China over the weekend, against a backdrop of ongoing concern over the recent rise in new cases in much of the U.S.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 futures contract was down 558 points, or 2.2%, having pared deeper earlier losses. The S&P 500 futures contract was also down 1.9%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 1.5%.
Over the weekend, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow advocated changes to the structure of government handouts to households affected by the virus. Kudlow told CNN that the $600 weekly boost to unemployment benefits should be reduced and redirected to people returning to work.
Among individual stocks, Walmart  (NYSE:WMT) and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) will be in focus after announcing a strategic partnership over the weekend as the big box retailer aims to bolster its position in e-commerce.
4. Europe's reopening gathers pace 
The news on the virus front was not all bad, however. France lifted its state of emergency and its restrictions on people arriving from elsewhere in Europe and said schools will fully reopen by June 22nd. 
In the U.K., all retail outlets were allowed to reopen, although the government is still attempting to keep social distancing measures in place.
Fashion chain Hennes & Mauritz (ST:HMb) said its sales in the first half of June were down only 30% from a year earlier, compared to a drop of 50% in May.
5. BP warns of huge writedowns due to lower oil prices
The pandemic’s long-term effects on the oil and gas industry were in evidence, as British major BP (LON:BP) warned it would write down its assets by between $13 and $17.5 billion in the second quarter, to reflect its expectations that oil prices would stay lower for longer.
BP said it expects an “enduring impact” on global demand for oil and gas, noting that many countries will want to “build back better” by favoring renewable and other low-carbon energy sources as overall energy demand recovers.
U.S. crude futures fell 1.5% overnight to $35.70 a barrel on the back of broader and more immediate fears about a second wave of infections. Brent futures fell 0.8% to $38.41."

Europe's largest economy went into lockdown in March, with many firms halting production and shops closing. It is now facing its worst recession since World War Two after the economy contracted by 2.2% in the first quarter.
""The economic recovery phase will take time because the epidemiological risks persist and citizens and companies react to them,"" the ministry said in its monthly report.
But the ministry said it looked like the trough had been passed and added that a gradual relaxation of the lockdown means the economic revival likely started from May.
The ministry said German foreign trade was likely to revive from May after exports and imports in April posted their biggest declines since records began in 1990.
But it predicted a significant decline in exports and imports for 2020 as whole.
The German government has stuck to the growth forecast it gave in April for a 6.3% contraction this year but many economic institutes have made more pessimistic predictions. 

The government's planned 130 billion euro ($146.29 billion) stimulus programme could boost economic output in Europe's largest economy by 1.3 percentage points both this year and next, the DIW institute said last week.

1208,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 04:50AM ET</span>","ECB struggling with weak public trust, paper shows","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Public trust in the European Central Bank appears to have dropped by more than in other governing institutions over the past decade, even as confidence in the euro currency remains robust, a new ECB paper said on Monday. 
Having pushed monetary policy close to its limits since the global financial crisis, the ECB has faced a barrage of criticism and legal challenges, raising questions both about policy and the way it communicates with the public.
The bank has launched a strategy review, but the exercise had to be postponed due to the coronavirus crisis - which also forced the bank to take even more radical measures. 
""Compared with both EU and national institutions, trust in the ECB appears to have been disproportionately affected by the crisis, experiencing a deeper fall and a slower recovery,"" the ECB paper said, referring to the decade since the global financial crisis.
As a result, trust in the ECB was lower than in the European Commission and the European Parliament, even as 76% of euro zone citizens expressed support for the euro itself.
Top sceptics included Germany and Austria, which have long criticised the ECB's ultra easy monetary policy and where citizens now trust the national government more than the ECB.
Countries that also suffered more in the debt crisis, such as Greece and Spain, were also among the sceptics.
Although the paper suggested few potential solutions, it noted that the ECB had a communication problem.
""Making communication more accessible to people with differing levels of education and prior knowledge, and also addressing the concrete concerns of citizens in different parts of the euro area – such as the ECB's role in economic outcomes – can enhance trust in the ECB,"" it said. 

It also criticised general education levels, arguing people needed to understand better what central banks do and what services they provide.

People who started jobs after a cut-off date in March for the state's wage subsidy scheme or who set up a company in the last year should not be excluded, the lawmakers from parliament's influential Treasury Committee said.
Self-employed people who earn more than a threshold set by the government, freelancers in industries such as theatre and television and directors of companies who pay themselves in dividends should also be covered, they said.
Mel Stride, who chairs the committee, said Sunak had acted quickly to slow an expected surge in unemployment as the crisis escalated in March. 
""If it is to be fair and completely fulfil its promise of doing whatever it takes, the government should urgently enact our recommendations to help those who have fallen through the gaps,"" he said.
Sunak has recognised that some people are not protected by his support plans but has shown no sign of expanding them again.
Nearly 9 million jobs are covered by the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which pays temporarily laid-off workers 80% of their salary, capped at 2,500 pounds a month. A separate scheme for self-employed people has received 2.6 million claims.

Britain's budget forecasters have estimated that the two programmes will cost nearly 70 billion pounds ($88 billion) this year, more than the entire government borrowing in the last financial year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will resume fiscal reform once the economy overcomes the hit from the coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said, brushing aside calls by some lawmakers to keep spending permanently with money printed by the central bank.
The government has pledged to spend a combined $2.2 trillion in two stimulus packages to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic, while the central bank has pledged to buy unlimited amounts of bonds to cap borrowing costs at zero.
""Japan's economy is battling a crisis, so the priority now is to use all available means to put it on a recovery path,"" Abe told parliament on Monday, when asked how Japan would reconcile the huge spending with the need to fix its tattered finances.
""By achieving economic growth, Japan can restore fiscal health. But that doesn't mean Japan can endlessly increase debt,"" he said, adding the government will resume efforts to improve the country's fiscal health once the economy stabilises.
Abe's remarks come amid calls from some lawmakers for Japan to prop up the economy via unlimited money-printing to finance government spending - a concept dubbed ""Modern Monetary Theory"" (MMT) that has been floated by some U.S. academics.
Japan's economy slipped into recession and is seen suffering an annualised contraction of over 20% in April-June, as lockdown measures to contain the pandemic hit consumption and businesses.
Analysts say Japan's huge public debt - already the biggest among major industrialised nations - constrains its ability to ramp up fiscal spending to spur growth.

S&P Global Ratings last week lowered its outlook on Japan's sovereign debt rating to stable from positive, citing increased uncertainty over the country's fiscal health as it boosts spending to combat the health crisis.

The German Constitutional Court last month gave the ECB three months to explain the proportionality of its bond purchases or risk losing Germany's Bundesbank, one of 19 national central banks that are members of the ECB, as a participant in the programme.
It also called on the German parliament and government to challenge the ECB on the matter. 
""The Bundesbank must be primarily responsible for this review,"" the experts in the Bundestag's research services said in the assessment, excerpts of which were published by the Augsburger Allgemeine daily.
The Bundesbank would have to withdraw from the bond purchase programme if it were found to be disproportionate, it added.
The Bundestag's research services offer non-partisan specialist analyses and expert views on questions raised by lawmakers. Their view is not binding but carries weight in Berlin.
The Constitutional Court ruling poses a conundrum for Berlin, which is bound to respect the Karlsruhe court but does not want to erode the independence of the ECB, whose unprecedented economic stimulus programme has kept the euro zone intact.
Politicians and bankers are trying to find a way through the legal complexities the ruling has thrown up regarding the relationship between European and German laws and institutions and to work out which institution should make the assessment.

1213,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2020 06:25PM ET</span>",Low expectations as Johnson joins EU leaders to break Brexit deadlock,"By John Chalmers and Jan Strupczewski
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will join a video-conference with EU leaders on Monday, keen to make headway in negotiations on a future EU-UK relationship, but officials in Brussels expect no breakthrough in the Brexit deadlock.
Britain's Mail on Sunday reported that Johnson would use the meeting to ""bang the table"", pressing the 27-nation European Union to aim for an agreement by the end of the summer and not to use the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to drag its feet.
However, officials in Brussels said the afternoon discussion with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the heads of the European Council and European Parliament was a long-scheduled stock-taking exercise, not a negotiation.
""No one expects any breakthrough unless Boris Johnson decides to surprise us,"" said one senior official. ""This meeting was scheduled in the withdrawal agreement, so it is happening but no one expects much.""
Britain left the EU in January and its relationship with the bloc is now governed by a transition arrangement that keeps previous rules in place while the two sides negotiate new terms.
London confirmed last week that it had no intention of extending the transition period beyond the end of this year, a prospect some fear may lead to a no-deal Brexit that could compound the economic damage caused by the coronavirus crisis.
London and Brussels remain far apart on issues such as fair competition guarantees and fishing rights. 
In talks this month, negotiators made very little progress towards a free trade pact, but they agreed to intensify negotiations and the hope is that Monday's talks with Johnson will open the way for a renewed political push.
One EU official said the conference would be an opportunity for the bloc's leaders to emphasise that the insistence of their chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, on a broad deal that would keep Britain closely aligned with the EU reflected the will of all member states and not his intransigence.

Another said that despite plans to speed up negotiations, major progress was unlikely until after the summer when London would ""scramble to get something done"" in the 11th hour, as it did last year to clinch a deal on its withdrawal agreement.

The BOJ is likely to leave interest rates and asset purchases unchanged at the end of its two-day meeting. Officials will consider the impact of measures taken so far to soften the virus blow and don’t see a pressing need now for any further major moves, people familiar with the matter said.
Many economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the estimated size of a BOJ loan program linked to government lending to rise after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s administration announced an expansion of the lending measures last month.
Market fluctuations last week are far from the volatility observed in March and continued stability in the yen has given the BOJ breathing room to sit tight for the time being. The economy is also likely past its weakest point, following the lifting of Japan’s state of emergency in late May and the gradual easing of lockdowns in key export markets.
“No big move doesn’t mean that the BOJ is free from any concerns,” said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco (NYSE:IVZ) Asset Management in Tokyo. “The BOJ will be checking what else needs to be done and communicating its willingness to do more.”
Since March, the bank has pledged unlimited purchases of government bonds, expanded its exchange-traded fund buying and launched loan programs as part of measures estimated to be worth about $700 billion.
The Federal Reserve last week painted a gloomy picture of the U.S. outlook and hinted that interest rates may effectively stay at zero through 2022. Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will probably sound a dovish tone at his post-decision press conference to avoid the possibility of the yen strengthening.
The BOJ policy statement is usually out in early afternoon with Kuroda’s press conference following at 3:30 p.m. in Tokyo.
What Bloomberg’s Economist Says
“A yen in a relatively comfortable range against the dollar also takes pressure off the BOJ to consider loosening policy. The yield differential with the U.S. is likely to limit any dollar weakness.”

1215,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>",Systemic racism slows economic growth: Dallas Fed chief Kaplan,"By Doina Chiacu
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Systemic racism and high unemployment levels among black and Hispanic Americans create a drag on the U.S. economy, Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan said on Sunday.
""A more inclusive economy where everyone has an opportunity will mean faster workforce growth, faster productivity growth and will grow faster,"" Kaplan said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" 
Kaplan said he agreed with his counterpart at the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank, Raphael Bostic - the Fed’s only African-American policymaker - who on Friday called for an end to racism and laid out ways the U.S. central bank can help.
The comments by the Fed policymakers follow weeks of nationwide protests against police brutality and racism after the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man, in Minneapolis. The white police officer who knelt on Floyd's neck has been fired and charged with murder.
""It's in the interest of the U.S.,"" Kaplan said. ""The fastest-growing demographic groups in this country are blacks and Hispanics. If they don't participate equally, then we're going to grow more slowly.""
Kaplan said the Dallas Fed and the Federal Reserve System have been working for years to improve skills training and education for blacks and Hispanics, who have long endured a higher level of unemployment than whites.
Overall unemployment, which spiked dramatically during the shutdowns, is on the way down, Kaplan said, adding that he expects to see positive job growth starting this month. 
He said fiscal policy, which is set by Congress, will be a critical element of the recovery, including unemployment benefits, possibly ""restructured to create more incentives for people to go back to work,"" and benefits to state and local governments. 

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow cited positive signs as the economy reopens, telling CNN, ""We are in the recovery stage.""

1216,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 14, 2020 10:09AM ET</span>",Fed’s Powell to Bring Sober Message to Capitol Hill This Week,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will deliver a cautionary message about the U.S. economy and Covid-19 when he appears twice this week on Capitol Hill.
His remarks to lawmakers are widely expected to echo the mostly downbeat assessment he gave June 10 after policy makers held interest rates near zero at a two-day meeting and signaled they’d probably stay there through 2022. His performance, which highlighted the hardships faced by millions of Americans who’ve lost work, drew criticism from a White House official for being overly negative.
“I can’t see him straying from that message,” said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. “If he changes his tune in any way, people are going to be jumping all over it. Democrats will accuse him of bending to the political will of others.”
Powell will testify via video conference at 10 a.m. Washington time Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee and at noon Wednesday to the House Financial Services Committee. Lawmakers will pose questions following Powell’s opening remarks. The appearance is connected to the Fed’s semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress, which the central bank published June 12.
With the U.S. economy beginning to emerge from pandemic-provoked shutdowns and despite recent economic data offering some surprisingly bright points, Powell last week emphasized how many Americans are out of work and how long it may take to heal the labor market, especially for minorities hit hardest by layoffs.
May Surprise
“The May employment report, of course, was a welcome surprise,” he told reporters during a virtual press conference June 10. “We hope we get many more like it, but I think we have to be honest, it’s a long road. Depending on how you count it, well more than 20 million people displaced in the labor market. It’s going to take some time.”
The Labor Department’s May payrolls report showed unemployment fell to 13.3% from 14.7% when economists were predicting an increase to 19%. The Labor Department added, however, that as many as 5 million people had been miss-classified in their surveys and the actual unemployment level was likely 3 percentage points higher. But that was still much better than expected.
Powell’s take represented a stark contrast to the reaction from President Donald Trump, who characterized the jobs report as the “greatest comeback in American history.” Trump faces a difficult re-election test in November when unemployment will almost certainly remain elevated.
‘Lighten Up’
Powell’s more cautious assessment, and his overall tone at the press conference brought criticism from White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who took a swipe at Powell for being too dour.
“I do think Mr. Powell could lighten up a little when he has these press offerings,” Kudlow told Fox News Thursday. “You know, a smile now and then, a little bit of optimism, OK.”
While Powell is being nudged by the White House to offer a brighter outlook, the Fed chair will likely do his own nudging this week of Congress, carefully encouraging lawmakers to offer additional fiscal stimulus, a point on which he is much more closely aligned with the president and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
Fiscal Fight
He’ll have to remain careful to avoid getting tangled in a partisan debate. Democrats are also pushing for more fiscal action, especially aid for states and cities facing massive budget shortfalls, but many Republicans have balked at raising additional debt and have pointed to the May jobs report as reason to wait.
Powell has repeatedly said Congress may have to do more, but has stopped short of wading into the political fight.
In his press conference, he said more direct fiscal support for businesses “may be needed.” But he also noted that policy maker forecasts released last week largely didn’t incorporate additional fiscal intervention, before adding, “If there were more fiscal support, you’d see you’d see better results sooner, but that’s a question for Congress.”
James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Financial Markets, said he wouldn’t be surprised if Powell were slightly more forward on the fiscal issue.
“There’s going to be incredibly forceful questioning on this point,” he said. “Should we not see more fiscal support for states that could have a detrimental effect on the economy.”

The funding will be used “to immediately start work on small priority projects identified by the states and territories,” Morrison will say in a speech to a conference hosted by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia. About A$1 billion will be allocated to “shovel-ready” projects, with the balance to target works to improve road safety.
Morrison is seeking to reopen most parts of the economy by the end of next month, helped by success in containing the spread of the coronavirus and keeping the rate of new daily infections to below 0.2%. The lockdown has ended Australia’s almost 29-year recession-free run, the developed world’s longest uninterrupted economic growth streak.
“We need to bring the same common sense and cooperation we showed fighting Covid-19 to unlocking infrastructure investment in the recovery,” Morrison said.
The government has already committed nearly A$180 billion to infrastructure over the next decade and since November has brought forward or injected almost A$7.8 billion in investment, Morrison will say. Some 15 major projects will be fast-tracked to support more than 66,000 jobs.

1218,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 14, 2020 07:17AM ET</span>",Economic Calendar - Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,"By Noreen Burke
Investing.com - Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is due to testify to Congress amid concerns over a possible resurgence of Covid-19. U.S. retail sales data will be watched for indications on the strength of the reopening rebound, with investors waiting to see if the recent bounce in value stocks can be sustained. Across the pond, the Bank of England is expected to further expand its stimulus program after a report showing that the economy contracted by more than 20% in April. And its set to be a busy week in the European Union with a fresh round of Brexit talks and a summit to discuss its pandemic recovery fund proposal. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is to testify on the central bank’s semiannual monetary policy report before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday. Investors will be on the lookout for any further indication of the Fed’s view on the economy and more clarity on its bond buying and lending programs.
Last week the Fed indicated that it plans years of extraordinary support for an economy facing a long hard recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, with policymakers projecting the economy to shrink 6.5% in 2020 and the unemployment rate to be 9.3% at year’s end.
U.S. retail sales data for May is due out on Tuesday with investors on the watch for signs of an economy on the mend. April retail sales plunged a record 16.4% but hopefully that was the nadir and economists are forecasting an 8% rebound amid the ending of lockdowns across many states.
The latest initial jobless claims report will be released on Thursday. Jobless claims totaled 1.5m last week, marking the 10th consecutive weekly decline as hiring slowly returns. While claims have slowed, the unemployment rate, currently at 13.3% remains at historic levels.
The calendar also features updates on industrial production and housing starts.
As the U.S. economy begins to recover from the steep coronavirus slowdown, some fund managers have been drawn to value stocks, a sector that underperformed during the recent rally.
Value stocks tended to underperform growth stocks during the bull market that ran for more than a decade and ended this year.
That pattern has recently reasserted itself: The S&P 500 Value index was up just 4.5% over the last month compared to a 5% gain in the S&P 500 Growth index.
But increased uncertainty over the economic outlook or the course of the pandemic could push investors back into the growth companies that have delivered performance in recent months, so investors will be keeping a close eye on this week’s economic data.
All central banks are fighting the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, but the Bank of England also has Brexit to contend with. April's 20% GDP slump leaves Britain's economy the same size as in 2002; this year could bring the biggest contraction in 300 years.
The BOE is expected to give itself another 150 billion pounds in firepower at its Thursday meeting, adding to the expansion announced in March and some analysts reckon it could even stretch to 200 billion pounds.
The current rate of buying looks set to hit the limit over the next couple of months and an increase would help avoid premature discussion about ending the policy or of tapering.
The U.K. is also to release data on unemployment, inflation, retail sales and house price inflation during the week.
EU Commission President Von der Leyen is set to meet with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday in a bid to revive stalled talks on post-Brexit ties. So far there hasn’t been much progress on a free-trade agreement and there’s not much time left to extend the end-2020 deadline for a deal.
Then on Thursday and Friday EU leaders will meet to discuss the proposed recovery fund to repair economic damage from the pandemic. Most members support the recovery fund but a quartet dubbed the ""Frugal Four"" - Netherlands, Austria, Denmark and Sweden -- remain skeptical. For the proposal to succeed, it must be agreed on by everyone and any delay will be a major setback for the euro.

1220,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2020 10:45PM ET</span>",Column: Spend or hoard? Fate of forced savings could define pandemic recovery - Mike Dolan,"(The author is editor-at-large for finance and markets at Reuters News. Any views expressed here are his own)
By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - Many households have built up a stash of savings during the coronavirus lockdowns of the past three months -- and how they view them may dictate the speed of recovery from the pandemic.
Although the shock has caused spikes in unemployment, most households spent lockdown periods either working from home, furloughed or on direct government income support. And with few goods or services available to buy, their savings have soared.
Whether people see these unexpected cash hoards as a windfall or a buffer against future uncertainties is likely to determine the speed of the recovery, at least this year.
If the public treats the money like a tax rebate, spending could surge, says Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS's global wealth management arm. He points to U.S. tax rebates in 2001 and 2008, money from which was fully spent within about two quarters -- mostly on durable goods such as furniture and consumer electronics.
As lockdowns lift with no second wave of virus infections so far, pent-up spending could be a big boost to third-quarter consumption -- underlining why some investors still believe in a ""V-shaped"" recovery.
""This involuntary saving could be spent. It will depend on fear and trust,"" Donovan said. ""Fear of the virus and fear of unemployment need to be low. Trust in government policy needs to be relatively high.
""These are, after all, savings that many people never wanted in the first place -- at least as far as saving on entertainment and services is concerned.""
CASH STASH
U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data last week showed the personal savings rate almost trebled to a record 33%, or $6.15 trillion, in April -- having already doubled to more than $2 trillion in March. In the six months before, the average was nearly $1.3 trillion, or just under 8%.
Directly comparable data for Europe, which locked down earlier, is not yet available, but the European Commission is forecasting that household savings rates will nearly double to 20% this year. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) meanwhile points to a record jump of over 300 billion euros in euro zone private sector deposit inflows in March, although that will include firms building up cash to survive the freeze. 
And on Tuesday, Bank of England data showed UK household deposits rose by 30 billion pounds over March and April compared to average monthly increases of 5 billion pounds in the six months prior. There was also record net repayment of consumer credit of 7.4 billion pounds in April alone.
Donovan notes that despite the large aggregate numbers, the distribution is scattered. 
For many furloughed workers in Europe, for example, income has been at 80% of normal levels. But spending has probably declined by 20-30% across the major economies.
Some American households may even see a temporary rise in weekly incomes as they claim jobless benefits of $1,000 per week -- higher than half of all working wages. They also get a $1,200 one-off government payment.
It is higher income groups that tend to save more, however, as they spend a smaller share of their incomes on food and essentials. Much of that discretionary spending is on services such as travel, restaurants and entertainment that have largely been unavailable during the crisis.
POLICY TWISTS
While major uncertainties remain about the reopening of economies, job security, the trajectory of the virus and a potential vaccine, government and central bank policies will help determine whether this money leaves bank accounts as quickly as it arrived.
Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff argues that preventing cash hoarding is one reason why the U.S. Federal Reserve should consider adopting negative interest rates -- effectively a charge for not spending -- as European central banks have done. 
Others fear zero and negative deposit rates just lead to a ""paradox of thrift"", where people put aside even more to make up for lost returns -- further swelling the savings glut.
For governments, the issue may also inform post-pandemic support. With private consumption the main driver of economic activity -- as high as 70% of GDP in the United States --  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economists say changes in savings patterns could easily offset any new fiscal measures.
They argue that fear of future tax rises to fix public finances could prompt household caution -- so-called ""Ricardian equivalence"", a phenomenon sketched by 19th century economist David Ricardo suggesting the public's behaviour in response to government saving or borrowing offsets the impact of policies.

What is clear is that current bloated savings levels mean confidence, or lack of it, could have a snowballing impact in the second half of 2020. Financial markets are already taking that on board.

1222,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 13, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: The Fed's GDP Outlook Bears Vs. Bulls,"By Liz Moyer and Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com - Until this week, investors seemed to be buying the story of a swift economic revival. But the Federal Reserve ended those hopes, predicting the economy will contract by 6.5% this year, followed by a robust 5% rebound in 2021.
Is the Fed’s economic outlook for next year more hope than reality?  
Liz Moyer argues that a rapid economic recovery is fraught with difficulty given the damage of the Covid-19 shutdowns and the potential for a second wave of infection.
Yasin Ebrahim contends that the well of stimulus from both the Federal Reserve and Congress will support the economy, which is already showing signs of bottoming out, until a vaccine is found, with hope sometime next year. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bear Case
On Friday, the Fed's monetary report to Congress set a bleak picture. The economy, which entered recession in February, could be struck by a large number of small business failures, which would further slow recovery and lead to lasting damage.
Recovery, the report said, depends on these businesses for survival. The prospect of ""widespread failure would adversely alter the economic landscape of local communities and potentially slow the economic recovery and future labor productivity growth.""
Job losses have hit small businesses harder, and such businesses make up about half the jobs in the private sector. Many of them were forced to close completely until social distancing rules can be loosened or lifted.
On the subject of jobs, some 20.9 million Americans were collecting unemployment as of last week. That's down from the peak of 24.9 million earlier in May but still at record high levels since the post-World War II era. Businesses are slowly reopening, but there's no way to quantify how many jobs have been permanently eliminated by the shutdowns, as businesses either go under or find new ways to operate in a post-Covid world.
The Fed was already projecting economic growth of less than 2% next year and the year after, even with historically low interest rates at practically zero. And that was with unemployment numbers at their lowest in 50 years and business humming. It's hard to imagine bouncing back to growth of 5% next year after contracting 6.5% this year amid the start-and-stop of the pandemic.
As Fed Chair Jay Powell said himself, the pace of recovery depends on how well the U.S. manages the virus. ""A full recovery is unlikely to occur until people are confident that it is safe to reengage.""
The Bull Case
There is no getting around the fact that a Covid-19 vaccine is the ultimate cure for the economy to prosper, once again. But short of a vaccine, stimulus is the next best thing.
Armed with an unprecedented wave of stimulus, the economy – after weeks of bruising attacks from Covid-19, the 'invisible enemy' – is showing signs of life.
The most recent report on the labor market showed an unexpected return in hiring that caught everyone, including the most revered economists, by surprise, further supporting the growing narrative that the worst of the pandemic's impact on the economy is over.
Recently, the uptick in coronavirus infections across states has threatened that narrative, raising fears of ‘lockdown 2.0.’
But the economy-crippling lockdowns are unlikely to be resurrected.
""We can't shut down the economy again. I think we've learned that if you shut down the economy, you're going to create more damage,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview on CNBC.
With the odds of another lockdown fast diminishing, and the economy showing signs of a pulse, the pace of developing a Covid-19 vaccine has taken on increasing importance to support the Fed’s bold prediction for the economy to grow 5% next year.
Fortunately, the race to develop a vaccine within the next year is well underway, with potential drugs and therapies already showing promising results in early-stage testing.
Early stage vaccine testing in animals and phase 1 testing in humans ""looks quite promising,"" said Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci.
""I believe that if we get the trial going this summer, we will collect enough data by the Fall and early Winter, that by the end of this calendar year, we may know that a vaccine works and have doses to distribute and likely well into the early part of 2021,"" he said.
With the dawn of the new year widely expected to bring a vaccine, and the well of stimulus set for fiscal and monetary top-up in the coming months, the economy could well be set-up for boom rather than bust.

Investing.com - Stocks rallied on Friday in volatile trading as Wall Street clawed back some of the sharp losses from the previous session.
The major averages, however, suffered their worst week since March as traders grew nervous of a resurgence in Covid-19 cases.


Despite that, the Nasdaq Composite has managed to rally nearly 45% from an intraday low set on March 23.


The tech-heavy index set a new all-time high above the 10,000-level on Wednesday.
The Nasdaq's upbeat performance has come on the back of strong gains in many of the big-name tech-related shares, most notably Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

The U.S. Treasury Department and the Small Business Administration said the look-back period for non-financial felony convictions has been reduced to one year from five years. The prohibition threshold for business owners with felonies involving fraud, bribery, embezzlement and similar offenses remains five years, they said.
The change goes further than what U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had suggested on Wednesday. He said the period for considering felony records would be reduced to three years. 
The Paycheck Protection Program, part of a historic fiscal package worth nearly $3 trillion passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump to deal with the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, offers businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for employee wages.

The Treasury Department and the SBA said the decision was made in the interest of criminal justice reform.

Some lawmakers wrote a letter to the prime minister saying the move will attract opposition and raised concerns about legislation proposed as part of the government's coronavirus recovery bill, the newspaper reported.
The bill includes a measure to grant cafes and pubs fast-track approval to serve food and drink outside, according to the report.
Johnson and his adviser Dominic Cummings both support legislation drafted by Downing Street under which larger supermarkets are to open for more than six hours on Sundays, the newspaper said.
Finance Minister Rishi Sunak and Business Secretary Alok Sharma are also said to be in favour of the move, the report added.
Some supermarkets are opposed to the changes while two big supermarket groups, Asda (N:WMT) and Morrisons (L:MRW), are said to be in its favour, The Times reported. 
Britain's Sunday Trading Act of 1994 allows large stores to open for no more than six consecutive hours between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. 

The proposed legislation would suspend them for a year as part of a bigger bailout effort to help retail and hospitality businesses weather the effects of the coronavirus outbreak, the newspaper added.

1226,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 05:30PM ET</span>","Fed's Bostic calls for end to racism, says Fed can play a role","(Reuters) - Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic, the Fed's only African American policymaker, on Friday issued an impassioned call for an end to racism and laid out ways the U.S. central bank can help do so. 
""I have shared in the outrage of the truly horrific events that brought us to this point,"" Bostic wrote on the bank's website, referring to the May 25 killing of George Floyd during an arrest by Minneapolis police, as well as police brutality and racism more broadly. 
The Fed, he said, ""can play an important role in helping to reduce racial inequities and bring about a more inclusive economy, he said, which would ""represent a rebuke of systemic racism and other exclusionary structures."" 
It is rare for a Fed policymaker to take a public stance on an issue traditionally seen as outside the U.S. central bank's wheelhouse, especially one seen as politically fraught. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday called out ""the pain of racial injustice,"" but Bostic's statement went further, linking the Fed's very mission to the mass protests against racism that have taken place around the world. 
The Fed's response to the pandemic and its aggressive pursuit of its goals of stable inflation and full employment, Bostic said, is one way it can contribute to ending racism, by laying the groundwork for businesses to grow faster, hire more workers, and create ""opportunities for African Americans and others who have not been as attached to the economy."" 
The Atlanta Fed can also use its broad reach, which extends particularly deeply into the business and banking communities, to highlight the negative consequences of an inequitable economy, he said. It is also changing its own policies to boost inclusion within its own organization, he said. 

""As the nation moves forward, the economy must work for all Americans,"" he said.

1228,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>",'Persistent fragilities' ahead for households and businesses -Fed report,"By Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Dunsmuir, Jonnelle Marte and Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve expects household finances and business balance sheets to suffer ""persistent fragilities"" as a result of the shock to economic activity arising from the coronavirus pandemic, the central bank said in a report to Congress on Friday.
In its twice-yearly Monetary Policy Report to U.S. lawmakers, the Fed also set out a litany of risks they see dogging any rebound from the cratering in output caused by widespread shutdowns imposed this spring to contain the spread of COVID-19.
""The strains on household and business balance sheets from the economic and financial shocks since March will likely create persistent fragilities,"" the report said.
The central bank delineated a host of other concerns, such as a highly uncertain outlook for containing the outbreak, with a substantial risk for a resurgence in infections; a potential wave of business bankruptcies - among small businesses in particular - arising from the collapse in consumer demand; uncertainty about prospects for a recovery in demand for workers and possible downward pressures on wages; major stresses appearing in state and local government finances; and a potentially costly reconfiguration of global supply chains fractured by the disruption to trade. 
Moreover, the COVID-19 recession, determined earlier this week to have officially begun in February, has weighed most heavily on the critical services sector, accounting for roughly two-thirds of U.S. economic output, and that may hamper the recovery.
""Unlike past recessions, services activity has dropped more sharply than manufacturing - with restrictions on movement severely curtailing expenditures on travel, tourism, restaurants, and recreation - and social-distancing requirements and attitudes may further weigh on the recovery in these sectors,"" the report said. 
The Fed said the pandemic's hit to the labor market was ""sudden, severe, and widespread"" but pointed out that job losses disproportionately affected low-wage workers who may be less prepared to last an extended period of time without pay. 
And it noted that state and local governments are under ""significant stress"" after facing a sharp drop in tax revenue. State and local governments continued to shed jobs in May even as the economy overall gained workers, providing an early sign that the worst of coronavirus-related job losses may be over.
LONG ROAD AHEAD 
The release of the report, which precedes two days of congressional testimony by Fed Chair Jerome Powell next Tuesday and Wednesday, comes two days after the Fed wrapped up its latest policy meeting. 
At the meeting, the Fed signaled the U.S. economy faces an arduous and uncertain recovery from the recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.
""It is a long road. It is going to take some time,"" Powell said in a webcast press conference after the meeting.
In economic projections on Wednesday, Fed policymakers saw the economy shrinking at a 6.5% annualized rate in 2020 and the unemployment rate at 9.3% at year's end. While officials saw growth snapping back somewhat in 2021, they projected the jobless rate would remain elevated. [nW1N2D901E]
That somber assessment of the outlook doused much of the optimism for a fast recovery that had been sown by the surprise growth in employment in May and factored heavily in Thursday's dramatic sell-off on Wall Street, when U.S. stocks fell by the most since March.
On Friday, stocks staged an early rally, but by mid-afternoon had given back most of those gains and had recouped only a small fraction of Thursday's 5.9% drop in the S&P 500 Index (SPX).
Powell and his colleagues have repeatedly reinforced their pledge to use all the tools at their disposal to foster a rebound, and Friday's report reasserted that commitment. Since March, the Fed has slashed its benchmark overnight lending rate to near zero and rolled out nearly a dozen emergency programs to stabilize financial markets and provide credit for firms in need of capital to survive the downturn.
According to this week's projections, all 17 current Fed policymakers see the key overnight interest rate, or federal funds rate, remaining near zero through next year, and 15 of 17 see no change through 2022.
Perhaps notably the Fed did not use the monetary policy report to call on Congress outright for further fiscal support, though in a separate report issued Friday on a series of community outreach events it noted that extra unemployment benefits expire this summer and ""if the economic downturn continues and the benefits are not renewed"" many families will not have the money for rent, food, or other bills. 

On Wednesday Powell kept his admonition mild, noting the difficulty that potentially millions of people will have finding jobs again soon and saying ""it's possible that we will need to do more, and it’s possible that Congress will need to do more.""

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A large number of small U.S. businesses could fail during the coronavirus recession, the Federal Reserve said on Friday, slowing recovery and creating lasting damage to the world's largest economy.
""The nature of the economic recovery that follows the COVID-19 crisis will depend in part on the survival of small businesses,"" the Fed said in its biannual monetary policy report to Congress on Friday. ""The pandemic poses acute risks to the survival of many small businesses (whose) widespread failure would adversely alter the economic landscape of local communities and potentially slow the economic recovery and future labor productivity growth."" 
Congress has extended some help, including $660 billion to cover payrolls and overhead. About three-quarters of small businesses with employees have applied for the aid, with many getting funding, the Fed said. Still, ""some industries may face an ongoing need"" after the program expires this summer.. 
Meanwhile job losses have been steeper at small businesses than large ones, with many small firms stopping paychecks entirely, the Fed said. Some 30% to 40% of small firms in sectors most affected by social distancing have gone inactive since February. Spending at small restaurants was down 80% by April during the height of the nation's shutdowns and was still down by half in early June, the Fed said, citing data from credit card transaction processor Womply. 
Small businesses account for nearly half of jobs in the private sector, and new business formation fell steeply in the early months of the crisis, data from the Census Bureau shows. 

Small business failures not only destroy jobs but ""erase the productive knowledge within the firms, deplete the assets of business owners, alter the character of communities and neighborhoods, and, in some cases, deprive the country of innovations,"" the Fed said.

The country's sovereign bonds were up an average 0.6%, while the local Merval stock index rose more than 4% at open, continuing a surge as investors with an appetite for risk flock to Argentine assets despite the country's crises. 
Argentina is racing to restructure a painful debt load it says that it cannot pay, after its ninth sovereign default in May, with a moving deadline for talks on Friday. Striking a deal is key to averting a long and messy legal standoff with creditors.
""We remain pretty optimistic and price action underlines that,"" said one bondholder who is not part of the main creditor committees involved in the negotiations.
""Maybe the new offer will be a modest improvement but they will want to get reasonably high acceptance to reduce the risk of litigation,"" he said.
Argentine President Alberto Fernandez said on Wednesday that a deadline for the talks will likely be extended by at least 10 days and possibly more. He also reaffirmed that the country needed to strike a deal.
A government source previously told Reuters that an amended offer would likely be unveiled this week.

Argentina's bonds, which slumped last year into distressed territory, have been higher in the last month as talks have progressed, despite a gap remaining between what Argentina is willing to pay and what key creditor groups want.

“Despite increased resilience from the financial and regulatory reforms adopted since 2008, financial system vulnerabilities—most notably those associated with liquidity and maturity transformation in the nonbank financial sector—have amplified some of the economic effects of the pandemic,” officials said. “Accordingly, financial-sector vulnerabilities are expected to be significant in the near term.”
The central bank also highlighted the risks to the economy and job losses, with a section dedicated to the topic.
The Fed’s policy committee this week voted to keep interest rates near zero and central bankers penciled in no rate hikes through 2022. In their first forecasts since December, Federal Open Market Committee participants projected an unemployment rate of 9.3% at year’s end, edging down slowly over the next two years, with inflation below the Fed’s 2% target through 2022 amid weak demand.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, in his press conference Wednesday, suggested it will take years for the economy to regain the more-than 20 million jobs lost due to the coronavirus-induced recession, calling the impact “heartbreaking” on lower-income workers and minorities.
The semiannual report precedes Powell’s testimony to Congress starting Tuesday with an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee. The Monetary Policy Report released Friday is aimed at informing the Congress of the Fed’s outlook and sense of risks to U.S. and global growth.
The central bank has unveiled nine emergency lending programs to keep credit flowing during the pandemic, though one of the most eagerly awaited, a facility aimed at Main Street businesses, has yet to be launched.
On Monday it expanded this program to include smaller companies and said it would be open to eligible lenders “soon.” Powell repeated this outlook Wednesday and also said the Fed was looking very strongly at how it could incorporate non-profit organizations in either the Main Street program or in a facility of its own.

1232,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 11:25AM ET</span>",Germany hopes stimulus measures will drive second-half recovery,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany can avoid a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic and a new 130 billion euro ($147 billion) stimulus package should help Europe's largest economy recover from the second half of the year, ministers said on Friday.
Germany's economy has taken a battering after many firms went into lockdown in March to curb the spread of the coronavirus and the government expects a 6.3% contraction this year - which would be its worst recession since World War Two.
As part of the stimulus package, the cabinet agreed on Friday to cut value-added tax VAT to 16% from 19% from July 1 until Dec. 31 in a bid to boost consumption and to give parents a cash handout of 300 euros per child.
""We want to make sure that the economic trough is passed in the second half of the year,"" Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told a news conference.
He later said the first signs of recovery were already starting to show.
""In some sectors, we are seeing some hopeful developments,"" he said, adding that it would likely take until 2022 for the economy to get back to the position it was in before the virus struck.
Both measures agreed on Friday are part of a wider package the government announced last week and which the DIW institute has said could boost economic output by 1.3 percentage points this year and next.
The stimulus measures come on top of a 750 billion-euro rescue package agreed in March which encompassed a debt-financed supplementary budget of 156 billion euros.
Germany's measures, which together with liquidity aid and loan guarantees equal more than 30% of its economic output, go substantially beyond any other national emergency programmes launched by other euro zone countries.
Germany can afford generous spending splurges as it has had a balanced budget since 2014.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told a joint news conference with Altmaier that Germany was well placed to avoid a second wave of the virus - a risk that unnerved financial markets on Thursday.

The chances were ""very, very large that we will get past this major problem,"" Scholz said.

While the fall in April - when the economy spent a full month under lockdown - was dramatic, the big question was how much long-term damage this would inflict on Britain's economy, he said.
""We hope that will be as small as possible but we have to be ready and ready to take action, not just the Bank of England but more broadly, on what we can do to offset those longer term damaging effects,"" Bailey told broadcasters.

The BoE is expected to announce a fresh increase of at least 100 billion pounds ($126 billion) in its bond-buying firepower following a policy meeting next week.

The Bank of Italy has forecast Italian gross domestic product to fall by 9.2% and the European Commission projects -9.5%, as the economy buckles under the impact of the coronavirus.
Speaking at a forum organised by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Gualtieri said in a video link-up that even though data for April and May had been broadly as the government anticipated and a recovery was now expected, some sectors, such as tourism, would struggle for longer.
""That is the reason why we think our forecast may be slightly revised to the downside"", he said.
Asked about the sustainability of Italy's huge public debt, targeted to rise to 155.7% of GDP this year, Gualtieri said the government intended to focus on improving the country's growth potential while reducing borrowing from next year.
""We want to significantly boost public and private investment... growth enhancing policies and fiscal sustainability, that is the core of our strategy,"" he said.
Gualtieri, from the centre-left Democratic Party, said Italy's debt would come down next year and decline ""substantially"" in future years when the country would return to running a budget surplus net of interest spending.
This year's overall deficit is targeted to jump to 10.4% of GDP as the government ramps up borrowing to try to soften the economic impact of one of the world's worst COVID-19 epidemics.
A wealth tax to raise resources for extra spending or bring down the debt was not in the government's programme, Gualtieri said. 
Despite the recession tax revenues were holding up much better than expected, he said, thanks to the government's fight against tax evasion which was bearing fruit before the virus outbreak.

These efforts will continue to recoup some of the estimated 100-120 billion euros of lost revenue every year, Gualtieri said, adding that wanted Italy to become a world leader in terms of digital payments and creating a ""cashless society.""

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cash-strapped Cuba has canceled its annual international trade and investment fair slated for November due to the pandemic, state-run media reported on Friday, even as fallout from the novel coronavirus hammers revenues and imports.
Container traffic at the port of Mariel, responsible for 90% of containers entering the country, was down between 20% and 25% through May, compared with the same period last year, according to a shipping source with access to the data.
Cuba does not reveal key economic information in a timely manner, saying the information would be used against the country in applying U.S. sanctions.
The country, which depends on foreign exchange to import more than 50% of the food and fuel it consumes, and raw materials and packaging for just about everything else, shuttered tourism, a key foreign exchange earner, in March and has been in partial lockdown since. 
Food, hygiene and medicine shortages due largely to U.S. sanctions have become much worse, leading to waits for hours to purchase basic goods when available.
Among the Communist-led country’s top five commercial partners, China reported exports to Cuba fell 55% through April compared with the same period last year, while Spain and the European Union reported exports through March down a bit less than 30% through March.
Among the Caribbean island’s top 10 commercial partners, the United States reported food sales for cash, allowed under the trade embargo, were down 48% through April, while Canada reported a 17.5% decline.
Outside analysts such as the United Nations and the Economist Intelligence Unit have forecast a recession of around 4% to 6% after 0.5% growth in 2019.

The University of Michigan’s preliminary sentiment index increased 6.6 points to 78.9, according to data Friday. The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a gain to 75. Even with the improvement, the gauge remains well below pre-pandemic levels.
The gauge of current conditions advanced 5.5 points to 87.8 this month, while a measure of expectations jumped 7.2 points to 73.1.
The increase in sentiment highlights optimism that the reopening of the U.S. economy will restore jobs and help spur the spending needed to dig out of a deep recession. Still, two-thirds of respondents anticipated unfavorable economic conditions in the year ahead because of concerns about a resurgence in the coronavirus as well as lingering weakness in the job market.
“Despite the expected economic gains, few consumers anticipate the reestablishment of favorable economic conditions anytime soon,” Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said in a statement.
The university’s sentiment data are consistent with a weekly Bloomberg measure. The index of consumer comfort advanced in the first week of June to a six-week high as higher stock prices and the return to work for Americans continued to lift attitudes about personal finances, a report showed Thursday.
Inflation Expectations
The Michigan survey’s inflation expectations data continued to show a disconnect with government price figures indicating scant inflation in the economy. Consumers expect 3% inflation in the coming year, the sentiment report showed.
“It is likely that the recent rise in inflation expectations reflects a shift in consumer purchases from the full range included in the CPI to be more heavily focused on food purchases, which posted an annual gain of 4.8% in May,” Curtin said.
The data also showed a growing political divide, with the increase in consumer sentiment concentrated among Republicans and independent voters. At the same time, overall confidence in government economic policies declined, with the share judging policies as poor at the highest level since President Donald Trump was elected.
The Michigan survey was conducted May 27 to June 10. The Labor Department reported last week that 2.5 million jobs were added in May as reopenings generated more economic activity. Even so, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned on Wednesday that longer-term unemployment challenges may linger as a result of the pandemic.
The share of respondents who reported they expect their finances to improve in the next year rose to 42% from 32%, the university said. The gain was due to rising income, with an expected annual improvement of 1.3%, up from 0.5%.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Bank Central Asia (BCA) (JK:BBCA), Indonesia's largest bank by market value, may join a government programme to lend to banks to improve their liquidity, its president director told Reuters.
Indonesia's Financial Services Authority (OJK) and finance ministry this week said big banks that are healthy can apply to lend to banks facing a cash crunch due to the coronavirus pandemic, using funds provided by the government.
It is the first scheme in Indonesia to include commercial banks. In past crises, the central bank has provided short-term liquidity support.
Banks can provide liquidity using a special purpose vehicle with the interest rate capped at a level that the government will set, plus 300 basis points.
""If there is a bank that needs liquidity and there is no rumour swirling around, we can help,"" BCA president director Jahja Setiaatmadja said in a text message, when asked about participating. 
""We're still studying the use of SPV,"" he said.
BCA's end-March capital adequacy ratio was 22.5%, above minimum requirements under global capital rules, known as Basel III. BCA's non-performing loan ratio was at 1.6%. Its first-quarter net income was up 8.6% to 6.6 trillion rupiah ($467.36 million).
Other banks with strong capital positions may be interested in participating due to the spread, said Wawan Hendrayana, analyst at investment research firm Infovesta Utama, referring to the 300 basis points spread on offer.
Last month, officials said the programme would be funded in part using low-yielding bonds the government sells directly to the central bank.
Bank Indonesia and the finance ministry were still finalising details, Governor Perry Warjiyo said last week.
State-controlled Bank Mandiri, Indonesia's second-biggest lender by assets, was more cautious.
""In principle, if we're appointed by the government, we will do it,"" corporate secretary Rully Setiawan told Reuters. 
""This is being discussed at a higher level, including with the state-owned enterprises ministry,"" he said.
Mandiri's capital adequacy ratio was 17.67% in its first-quarter report, with an NPL ratio at 2.36%. Net income was up 9.4% to 7.9 trillion rupiah.
As of May 26, banks had restructured 517.2 trillion rupiah of loans for more than 5 million debtors, OJK data showed.
The banking industry's average capital adequacy ratio level in April was 22.13%, well above minimum Basel III requirements, while NPL ratios were 2.89%.
There are some signs of stress however. Bank Bukopin said this week it had negative cashflow due to a drop in overall savings.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU's executive said on Friday it was reassured that London was keen to step up the momentum of talks to implement the Withdrawal Agreement divorce deal agreed with Britain last year, but it warned that the window of opportunity was closing fast.
The European Commission's comments came ahead of a video-conference scheduled for Monday between British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the presidents of the European Union's three main institutions to take stock of the Brexit negotiations.
""The window of opportunity to put in place the operational measures needed to ensure that the protocol can function as intended on the first of January 2021 is rapidly closing,"" European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic said.
""We need to move from aspiration to operation and fast,"" he told a news conference after talks with British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove.
Britain left the EU in January. Their relationship is now governed by a transition arrangement that keeps previous rules in place while they negotiate new terms. 
Sefcovic said Gove told him that London had no intention of extending the transition period beyond the end of this year, a prospect some fear may lead to a no-deal hard exit that could compound the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
London and Brussels remain far apart on the issues of fair competition guarantees and the governance of their new relationship, as well as on fishing rights. In talks last week, negotiators made very little progress towards a free trade pact, but they did agree to intensify negotiations.
Sefcovic said he was hopeful that Monday's meeting between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Johnson along with the European Parliament and European Council presidents would lead to ""fresh momentum on the UK side"".

""I believe that the set of activities we discussed today ... should provide us with adequate, also political, space to move into positive developments over the summer, because we know autumn is around the corner and January 1 is not far from that.""

1242,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>",U.S. insurers use lofty estimates to beat back coronavirus claims,"By Alwyn Scott and Suzanne Barlyn
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. property and casualty insurers have cast the coronavirus pandemic as an unprecedented event whose massive cost to small businesses they are neither able nor required to cover.
The industry has warned it could cost them $255 billion to $431 billion a month if they are required, as some states are proposing, to compensate firms for income lost and expenses owed due to virus-led shutdowns, an amount it says would make insurers insolvent.
The estimate, made by the American Property Casualty Insurance Association (APCIA), a trade group, was recently used by the industry to successfully lobby against state and city lawmakers' efforts to legislate to make the sector pay.
Insurers say business interruption policies only apply when actual physical property damage prevents a business from operating and any attempt to apply cover beyond that, for a pandemic, are unconstitutional.
The stance has discouraged some policyholders from filing claims and prompted others to take legal action.
A Reuters examination of APCIA's estimate, however, suggests the possible bill may not be so onerous.
The APCIA estimate is an industry worst-case scenario based on all small firms with business interruption coverage being able to claim. It also assumes that between 60% and 90% of businesses with fewer than 100 employees will be impacted by COVID-19.
Only about 40% of small firms have business interruption coverage, according to the Insurance Information Institute, and most of the policies explicitly exclude pandemics, according to Tyler Leverty and Lawrence Powell, professors who specialize in insurance at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Alabama, respectively.
Powell has estimated that insurers could be on the hook for a maximum of $120 billion a month in claims on the basis that half of small firms have business interruption insurance.
Leverty said that if the estimate counted only businesses without explicit exclusions for pandemics, ""it would be in the millions per month.""
The APCIA said it stood by its numbers, which it said reflect the unique and widespread impact of the virus. It declined to comment on Powell's analysis.
""Yes, these are eye-popping figures,"" APCIA Chief Executive David Sampson told Reuters, referring to the association's estimate. ""This pandemic is unprecedented in its scale, reach, and economic impact."" 
NOT CLEAR-CUT
New Jersey's business interruption bill, a model for others, is stalled while Roy Freiman, the lawmaker who introduced it, waits for an alternative plan from the industry.
""I said, 'Look, we don't want insolvency, but surely there is some place between 100% denial and insolvency that you can operate within,'"" Freiman told Reuters.
The city council in Washington, D.C. shelved a similar plan in early May after ""pretty intense"" lobbying, Council Member Charles Allen, a supporter, told Reuters. APCIA's cost estimate was cited in council discussions along with an association white paper describing the plan as unconstitutional.
Chairman Phil Mendelson, who introduced the plan, withdrew it after members voiced fears of a lengthy court fight and insurer insolvency.
""Obviously, our concerns were heard,"" Sampson told Reuters at the time.
Trade groups say the industry's stance has deterred many claims.
""Businesses are being told if you file they will probably deny you,"" Andrew Wrigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, which represents 2,500 bars and restaurants in New York City, told Reuters.
""We're telling them to seek counsel and be on record filing claims."" 
That's not an option for George Sizemore, owner of Bit of England Darts & Games Shoppe in Virginia Beach.
Sizemore's insurance agent told him it would be pointless to claim for the $40,000 in revenue he said he lost while his store was shut because his policy does not cover pandemics.
""The only way I could file a claim would be to have a lawyer,"" said Sizemore. ""I just don't have the money.""
There are currently dozens of lawsuits in U.S. courts seeking compensation on behalf of small businesses for lost earnings due to the pandemic.
Legal experts said that while many policies exclude pandemics, some do not and there is precedent for courts requiring insurers to pay for physical loss without physical damage, such as when pollution or asbestos make property uninhabitable.

""It's not anywhere near as clear-cut as the industry says,"" said John Ellison, a partner at Reed Smith who has represented policyholders for three decades.

In a speech to Dutch business leaders, Klaas Knot said a European Commission plan proposed last month to borrow and then re-distribute funds to countries in a mix of grants and loans is fundamentally different to debt-sharing, or ""coronabonds"", which the Dutch oppose on principle.
Rather, it would be an ""increase of budgetary power of which the purpose is coupled to the current, very exceptional circumstances,"" Knot said.
""I would like to underline that I applaud solidarity at the European level from my heart, and I do so not least out of the Netherlands' own self-interest.""
The Dutch government is one of the ""frugal four"" nations with Sweden, Denmark and Austria, that have argued against the 500 billion in grants contained in the plan, much of which would go to Italy and Spain, the EU countries worst affected by pandemic.
In a June 9 letter to parliament, Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra said the financing of the proposals was ""far removed from the Netherlands' position."" The European Council is due to discuss the plan at a meeting June 19.

""Rise and rise again until lambs become lions,"" runs an oft-quoted line from the 2010 film 'Robin Hood'. The motto is being taken seriously by all those merry men and maidens chasing shares in little-known or even bankrupt firms, using a mobile trading app called Robinhood.
What's drawing punters to stock markets? Record savings, stimulus cheques, low interest rates and possibly just lockdown boredom. Their trading has spawned some eye-catching trades, including a 1000% one-day leap in Chinese property firm FANGDD (O:DUO) -- possibly because its name raised associations with the mighty U.S. tech sector.
Frenzied traders also piled into bankrupt names Hertz and JC Penney (OTC:JCPNQ), pushing shares 300-500% higher. Some Chinese fintech companies were pumped up for no apparent reason -- possibly they were climbing the charts on Robintrack, a site tracking activity on the Robinhood app.
Seasoned traders are scratching their heads. Big punts on small Chinese firms won't impact broader markets but retail cash coursing through mainstream shares will further widen the disconnect between equity prices and the global economy.

2/WATCH THAT VIX
The June 11 equity selloff brought the spotlight back onto the Cboe Volatility Index or VIX -- Wall Street's ""fear gauge"". It pared a weeks-long drift lower to rise above 40, https://tmsnrt.rs/2Yl9tGo its highest close since April 23, amid renewed fears for U.S. growth and the coronavirus trajectory.
A raft of U.S. data due in coming days might allay some concerns if they reveal an economy on the mend. April retail sales plunged a record 16.4% but hopefully that was the nadir. Industrial production and housing starts are the other anticipated data points.
The VIX could react, however, if infections rise further. Also, with U.S. presidential election campaigning getting underway, VIX futures are starting to capture political risks -- there's a visible bump in volatility expectations closer to the Nov. 3 vote.
(GRAPHIC - VIX jumps on renewed economic fears: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/jbyvrlabave/eikon.png) 
3/BOE WAR CHEST
All central banks are battling coronavirus damage but the Bank of England also has Brexit to contend with. April's 20% GDP slump leaves Britain's economy the same size as in 2002; this year could bring the biggest contraction in 300 years.
The BOE is expected to give itself another 100 billion pounds in firepower at its June 18 meeting, adding to the expansion announced in March. Some reckon it could stretch to 200 billion pounds. 
What about letting interest rates go negative? Unlikely -- the BOE says it needs more time to weigh that. 
Unfortunately, policy makers don't know if coronavirus cases will surge again or whether the government can reach a trading arrangement with the EU by Dec. 31. If Britain is cast adrift without a trade deal, all bets are off on the economic outlook - and indeed on how much QE the BOE will eventually have to do.

4/TICK TOCK 
The clock is ticking again for the European Union, which has two pressing matters to deal with. 
First Brexit. On June 15, Britain and the EU will attempt to revive stalled talks on post-Brexit ties. There's been little progress on a free-trade agreement and little time left to extend the end-2020 deadline for an deal. 
Then, on June 18-19, EU leaders will debate a recovery fund to repair COVID-19 damage. Most members support the European Commission proposal. But a quartet dubbed the ""Frugal Four"" - Netherlands, Austria, Denmark and Sweden -- remain sceptical. For the proposal to succeed, it must get the nod from everyone. Any delay will be a major setback for the euro and southern European bonds.

5/TWO AND THREE
Data from the world's second and third-largest economies will soon tell us how large a gap there is between hope and reality. China releases retail sales, industrial output and house price data, while Japan has trade figures and a central bank meeting. 
The Bank of Japan won't do much on June 15-16, given its yield curve is already set to a tune conducive for growth and its balance sheet continues to expand. 
China should show a multi-track recovery -- an industrial sector slowing less markedly, a timid consumer and a housing market feeding on cheap credit. 
Authorities are switching towards more targeted lending, away from just easing broad cash conditions, but it's too early to see that play out in data.

The panel, which considers the constitutionality of government proposals before their adoption, said the European Commission's plan represented ""qualitatively and for the size of the funding a new kind of element in the functioning"" of the EU.
The 27 EU member states will hold tough talks on June 19 on the EU executive's proposal to raise the unprecedented amount of debt (equivalent to $845 billion) to top up joint spending to 1.1 trillion euros in 2021-27. The package requires the unanimous support of the 27 to be adopted.
One of the major points of dispute is over the proportions of the package to be disbursed as grants or as repayable loans, with a group of fiscally frugal members including Finland wanting the share devoted to loans increased.
""The committee's understanding is that the arrangement may not necessarily be fully compliant with EU law. The government should ensure there are appropriate legal grounds in EU law for the (recovery plan),"" it wrote in a statement.
""The committee believes that Finland's ability to decide on its own budget should be protected as effectively as possible.""
Last week, the government said it would reject the EU package in its current form but left the door open for further negotiations.

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's ambitious plan to provide some 3 trillion rupees ($39.5 billion) in loans to small businesses to boost an economy ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic has got off to a slow start with banks disbursing only a tiny fraction of the available funds.
Lenders have paid out just 122 billion rupees, barely 4% of the sum earmarked, and approved loans worth 242.60 billion rupees since the third week of May, according to finance ministry data released on Thursday.
A senior finance ministry official accepted that according to feedback received from the industry, the scheme is facing several problems, and the government is trying to convince bankers to implement the scheme in ""letter and spirit"".
However, a senior banker at a public bank also said there had been a clear lack of demand because of the country's lockdown.
""Businesses don't want to avail themselves of it so the traction has been low,"" he said.
The finance ministry and the Indian Banks' Association, an industry body for lenders, did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.
India last month unveiled the fully-guaranteed government-backed loan scheme for small businesses, which account for nearly a quarter of India's economy and employ hundreds of millions of workers, according to government estimates.
New Delhi has been urging banks to lend more to these firms which have been hit by the more than two-month lockdown to rein in the spread of the virus. However, lenders worry about defaults.
Bankers say there is ""constant monitoring"" by the government and pressure to approve more loans.
""We are pushing hard and have contacted the borrowers but we have not heard back from most,"" said another banker at a state-owned lender.
Banks are also cherry-picking better placed companies as recovering such loans, even though they are government-backed, is not an easy task, said a third banker.

1249,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>","Turkey must restore credibility to win foreign funds, ex-minister says","By Ece Toksabay and Orhan Coskun
ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey must restore its economic credibility if it hopes to secure needed foreign funding and return to growth, said President Tayyip Erdogan's former economy czar who recently broke away and founded his own party.
Ali Babacan, a 53-year-old former deputy prime minister, resigned from Erdogan’s AK Party last July over ""deep differences"" about the direction of the party he helped found. In March he formed the Deva (Remedy) Party.
Babacan said in an interview with Reuters that Turkey risks another slump in the lira unless it can access fresh sources of foreign exchange, after the currency fell to a record low last month, but that trust in its economic institutions had eroded.
Erdogan last year sacked the central bank's chief for not cutting interest rates. The bank has since slashed rates well below inflation, stoking concerns over its independence. It has also used billions in foreign exchange reserves to defend the lira, prompting Ankara to seek foreign funding.
""Turkey must find that forex soon"" but it needs to ""reinstate the reputation and confidence in its economy management first,"" Babacan said.
""The institutions had already lost their credibility,"" he added. ""You can dictate onion prices...but you cannot dictate the foreign exchange price, that's not how the international markets work.""
Babacan, well regarded by foreign investors, served as economy and then foreign minister before becoming deputy prime minister from 2009 to 2015. 
Opinion polls currently show his party with just 1% or 2% support. Yet even incremental gains for Deva could spell trouble for Erdogan, who faces another election by 2023 at the latest. Babacan said it was unlikely Erdogan's government would last until 2023, adding he expected an election next year or in 2022.
The lira has been hit by fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and investor concerns over depleted net FX reserves and the country's relatively high foreign debt obligations. Ankara won some support when Qatar tripled an existing currency swap line to $15 billion last month.
Investors and bankers say Turkey would adopt capital controls, such as limits on transfers or withdrawals, only in a worst-case scenario. But Babacan said Ankara was already heading in that direction.
""Capital controls is not a black and white area, it consists of shades of grey. Turkey is going towards a darker grey,” he said.

The European Central Bank could extend a swap line in order to protect a key trade partner, he said. ""If the Turkish economy collapses today, this would harm the economies of Europe. The ECB must be seeing this, and they must play an active role.""

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The European Central Bank, which just last week said it was ramping up its already-whirring money-printing presses, will announce yet more stimulus measures in response to the pandemic-driven recession, a Reuters poll of economists predicted. 
The ECB on June 4 expanded its pandemic-related bond purchases by 600 billion euros to a total of 1.35 trillion, extending them to June 2021. COVID-19 has killed about 420,000 people globally, and coronavirus infections are still spreading.
In the latest Reuters poll, taken June 8-11, after most euro zone economies started to re-open from around two months of lockdown, over three-quarters of economists who answered an additional question, 31 of 41, said the ECB was not yet done with new policy announcements.
Of those 31 who expect the ECB to act again, 23 said the central bank would announce additional asset purchases by the end of 2020, including nine who expected such an announcement in July-September.
Others said the central bank could widen its purchases to include corporate bonds that lost investment-grade ratings during the pandemic, adjust its tiered deposit system, or provide cheap loans to commercial banks at even lower rates.
The results follow a massive downgrade to the ECB's staff forecasts and show economists who watch the central bank to be no more optimistic, expecting a slightly stronger recovery from an even deeper recession than they were predicting weeks ago.
""We think the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme will be with us for a very long time to come and this will be crucial as governments issue more (debt) to support their economies, so the ECB will have to buy more,"" said Marco Valli, head of macro research at UniCredit.
""We expect a fairly strong rebound in the second half of the year, but the first half will be very bad. Most people are probably underestimating the size of the contraction in the second quarter,"" Valli added, whose forecasts were the lowest in the poll at -21.2%.
The latest poll showed gross domestic product shrinking 12.5% this quarter compared with the first three months of the year, worse than the 11.3% contraction forecast in last month's poll.
It was then expected to expand 7.9% and 3.1% in the third quarter and fourth quarter, respectively, up from 7.2% and 2.8% in the May poll.
The wider Reuters poll of around 90 economists predicted the economy would shrink 8.1% in 2020, deeper than the 7.5% contraction predicted just a month ago, followed by a 5.4% expansion in 2021, up from 5.0% previously.

The consensus view for this year is not as pessimistic as the ECB staff's latest forecast of -8.7%. It foresees a 5.2% expansion in 2021, roughly in line with the Reuters poll. 
""We still expect the GDP level at the end of next year to be below pre-crisis levels. So despite the rebound, there will still be a lot of room to catch up,"" said UniCredit's Valli. 
Consumer price inflation was forecast to average 0.4% this year and 1.1% next, above the ECB staff projections of 0.3% and 0.8%, respectively.
Still, 34 of 38 respondents to an additional question said the ECB's response to the crisis had been ""about right"". 

A slim majority, 20 of 38, said the European Commission's proposed joint fiscal response, in the form of a 750 billion- euro recovery fund, was ""not enough.""

By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract was up 587 points or 2.3%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 1.9% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was 1.6% higher.
Wall Street tumbled in a broad sell-off on Thursday, with the Dow suffering its biggest one-day decline since the middle of March, as a jump in new Covid-19 infections threatened to slow down the pace of the reopenings prompting investors to ditch stocks and flee to safety.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.9%, or 1,861 points. The S&P 500 fell 5.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 5.3%. 
The indices are on track to end a spell of three winning weeks, with the DJIA down 7% so far, the S&P 500 down 6% and the Nasdaq Composite 3% lower.
“Equities had been trading in large part due to three factors: a V-shaped recovery of the real economy and earnings, optimism on the medical and public health front, and the likelihood of additional support from both the Fed and the fiscal authorities,” said John Velis, FX and Macro Strategist, Americas, BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) in a note to clients.
2. U.K. suffers record output drop
Britain's economy suffered a record collapse in April, shrinking by 20.4% in April from March as the country spent the month in a tight coronavirus lockdown.
""Record GDP falls in today’s figures. When taking April and March together the economy is 25% smaller. The economy in April the same size as it was in 2002,"" ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said on Twitter.
""Virtually all areas of the economy were hit, with pubs, education, health and car sales all giving the biggest contributions to this historic fall,"" said Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics.
These figures are particularly weak when compared with the U.K.’s main European rivals. 
The Bank of France estimated Thursday that the French economy would show a 15% quarterly contraction in the April-June period, while German industrial output dropped by 17.9% in April from March.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development did warn on Wednesday that Britain was on course for the worst downturn among all the major economic powers, forecasting its economy would contract 11.5% this year.
3. Heavy economic data slate
There are a number of economic indicators due for release Friday, with the Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey, due at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT), the main release.
Expectations are for a number of 75 for June, up from 72.5 the prior month, with sentiment likely on the rise as businesses are reopening and individual restrictions are being loosened in much of the country.
That said, the number of cases of the virus continues to rise in a number of the more populous states, while Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was downbeat in his assessment of the economic outlook earlier this week.
Before this, May's import price index, which measures the change in the price of imported goods and services purchased in the U.S., is expected to come in at 0.6% compared with a contraction of 2.6% for the prior month. 
May's export price index is also due and is expected to be a gain of 0.6% compared to a contraction of 3.3% the prior month. The figure tracks changes in U.S. exports to determine whether there was an increase in goods sold abroad or merely an increase in the price of exported goods. 
Both indices are due at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). 
4. Crude prices set for weekly drop
Crude oil prices were mixed Friday after Thursday’s sharp losses amid fears a surge in new coronavirus infections in many U.S. states could hinder a fragile recovery in demand at the world’s largest consumer, while swelling stockpiles raised fresh concerns about excess supply.
However, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. shouldn’t shut down the economy again even if there is another jump in coronavirus cases, helping the tone Friday.
“In our view, the bar for turning to lockdowns again seems very high,” said Danske Bank, in a note to clients. “Not least in the U.S., where there is strong opposition to this.”
Additionally, “the oil market has been overdue a pullback, with prices getting somewhat ahead of actual fundamentals,” said Warren Patterson head of commodities strategy at ING Bank NV in Singapore. “While the market is moving from a surplus to deficit environment, inventories remain at elevated levels and refinery margins are still very weak.”
Oil is heading for the first weekly loss since late April, also weighed by an increase in American crude stockpiles to a record high which raised fresh concerns about a potential supply glut.
Attention will turn Friday to the weekly release of the Baker Hughes rig count, an important business barometer for the oil drilling industry. 
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 0.2% at $36.26 a barrel, while the global benchmark Brent was 0.2% higher at $38.61 a barrel.
5. Time to ditch Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock?
Tesla stock has been one of the most desired on Wall Street over the last year or so, climbing around 145% this year, making the California-based electric-vehicle maker the top performer on the Nasdaq.
The stock climbed above $1,000 for the first time ever on Wednesday, resulting in a market capitalization of $120 billion, nearing that of Toyota, the biggest automaker in the world.
However, this may be the time for investors to think carefully about owning the stock, at least that what a couple of investment banking giants think.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) downgraded Tesla to underweight earlier Friday, saying its elevated price doesn’t properly reflect emerging risks, citing price cuts in China and the U.S..
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also cut its investment stance on the car maker Friday to neutral on a 12-month basis, citing a lofty valuation. However, it remained positive on the stock over the longer term.

More weak data will reinforce expectations for a sharp contraction in the world's third-largest economy this quarter due to the fall out from the pandemic. 
Exports are expected to have fallen 26.1% in May from a year earlier, the steepest drop since September 2009 when they tumbled 30.6%, according to the median forecast from the poll of 17 economists. Exports declined 21.9% in April.
""Although there is some movement to re-open economic activities in the United States and Europe, exports of transport machinery and capital goods fell significantly due to weak auto sales and declines in capital spending,"" Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist at Japan Research Institute, said.
The poll forecast a 20.4% decline in imports in May from a year earlier, following a revised 7.1% fall in April. 
That implied a trade deficit of 1.07 trillion yen ($9.99 billion) in May.
The finance ministry will publish the trade balance data at 8:50 a.m. on Wednesday (2350 GMT Tuesday).
The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food prices but includes oil costs, likely dipped 0.1% in May from a year earlier, according to the poll's median forecast. It would be second consecutive month that prices have fallen on a year-on-year basis.
In April, the core CPI fell 0.2%, which was the first year-on-year decline since December 2016.
""Consumer spending tumbled as people refrained from going out and their movements were also restricted. Downward pressure on prices has increased,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
The government will announce core CPI at 8:30 a.m. on Friday (2330 GMT Thursday).
Analysts in the poll forecast the Bank of Japan would keep its policy interest rate at minus 0.1%, and the 10-year Japanese government bond yield target at around 0% when it holds a policy meeting on June 15-16.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A $94 billion emergency fund that can be tapped without parliamentary oversight has been branded Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ""pocket money"" by opposition lawmakers alarmed at its unprecedented size.
Abe has said the 10 trillion yen ($94 billion) will allow the government to move swiftly to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus outbreak - a ""once in a century crisis"" which has devastated the economy.
""We'll report to parliament how we spend the money as needed and at the appropriate time,"" Abe told parliament on Friday.
But at 20 times the usual sum for a reserve fund - and roughly equal the amount Japan spends on education and defence combined - the fund has even raised questions from the bureaucrats who have discretion on how to spend the money.
""It's awful,"" said a finance ministry official. ""It's a huge blank cheque that would leave Japan with a bad precedent,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak publicly.
Japan's parliament approved on Friday a record $300 billion second extra budget - including the reserve fund - to finance part of an economic stimulus package of $1.1 trillion.
The issue highlights how Abe, pressed with time and under pressure to match massive stimulus deployed by other major economies, has rankled taxpayers with spending that one of the most indebted nations can ill afford.
""Lawmakers of Abe's ruling party wanted a magical wallet and thought they can get one because we're in a crisis,"" said independent political affairs analyst Atsuo Ito.
""Fiscal reform has become a distant goal... The cost of big spending will fall upon the next generation.""
Some analysts, however, argue the size is justified given the need to guard against a second wave of infection.
""You need huge sums in reserve when you're dealing with so much unpredictability. You need to be ready for emergencies,"" said Yasuhide Yajima, chief economist at NLI Research Institute.

CONSTITUTION
Japan typically sets aside reserves of around several hundred billion yen in the annual budget, largely to meet disaster relief and other unexpected costs.
The government has discretion on how to use the money and needs to report to parliament only after the funds are tapped.
Such reserves are usually kept small because it is an exception to a constitutional rule that requires budgetary spending to receive prior approval by parliament.
Japan has struggled to rein in spending even in good times and is now saddled with the biggest debt among industrialised nations that is twice the size of its $5 trillion economy.
The huge reserve - more than five times the 1.72 trillion yen deployed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami - has sparked concern that the size could become the norm, rather than an exception.
Finance Minister Taro Aso rebuffed the idea of compiling a third extra budget, saying it was premature to discuss it.
""We first have to see how the measures we've taken so far affect the economy,"" he said.
Opposition lawmaker Toranosuke Katayama, a former ruling party heavyweight and among Japan's longest-serving politicians, scolded Abe in parliament over what he saw as breaching the boundaries of parliamentary democracy.
""Budget needs prior parliament approval. That is a core principle of Japan's constitution. What you're doing could violate this principle,"" he said.
""Even when you're making exceptions, you need to set a limit. Otherwise 10 trillion yen could easily turn into 12 trillion yen. That's what I'm worried about.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has raised the chance Japan's economy will slip back into deflation as social curbs to halt the spread of the disease hits businesses and consumers, a majority of analysts polled by Reuters said.
With the world's third-largest economy set to suffer a more than 20% contraction this quarter, over half the analysts surveyed by Reuters bet the Bank of Japan will further expand its already massive monetary stimulus.
""Even after the pandemic is contained, Japan's output gap will unlikely return to positive territory this year and next,"" said Hiroshi Ugai, chief economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Securities Japan.
""That means Japan may suffer a mild deflation.""
When asked whether the pandemic could tip Japan back into deflation, 23 of 40 analysts polled said the chances were either ""high"" or ""very high."" The remainder said the likelihood was low.
Japan's core consumer prices, which exclude volatile fresh food but includes energy costs, are seen falling 0.5% in the current fiscal year ending in March 2021, the poll conducted between June 2-11 showed.
Core consumer inflation is projected to hit a modest 0.3% next fiscal year, according to the poll.
With business activity hit by lockdown measures from April through late May, Japan's economy is expected to shrink an annualised 21.3% in April-June, marking the third straight quarter of contraction, the poll found.
GDP was seen rebounding 8.0% in the third quarter and 5.4% in the final quarter of 2020.
The economy will shrink 5.2% this fiscal year before recovering to 3.2% growth next year, the poll showed.
Sixty-five percent of analysts polled expected the BOJ's next move to be a further expansion of stimulus, although this is down from nearly 80% in the previous poll.
The government issued a state of emergency in April requesting citizens to stay home and businesses to shut.
Although the state of emergency was lifted in late May, there is uncertainty how quickly businesses will re-open. The need for social distancing policies could hurt profits for many retailers, analysts say.
""Economic activity has restarted in several phases but there's still a risk of another wave of infection. That will keep consumers cautious,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities. 
The BOJ eased monetary policy for a second straight month in April and created in May a new lending facility to channel money to small firms hit by the pandemic.
The government has laid out two spending packages worth a combined $2.2 trillion to ease the pain on an economy already headed for deep recession.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy appears to have hit bottom and is eyeing a recovery from the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, its finance minister said, underscoring cautious optimism spreading among policymakers after the relaxation of lockdown measures.
The remarks come ahead of next week's rate review by the Bank of Japan, which is likely to hold off on expanding stimulus and stick to its view the world's third-largest economy is headed for a gradual recovery. 
""We've succeeded in putting a floor on the economy, which seems to have hit bottom. How strong the recovery will be depends not just on domestic conditions but overseas developments,"" Finance Minister Taro Aso told parliament on Friday.
He added that conditions surrounding Japan's economy will remain ""severe"" for the time being due to risks such as the chance of a second wave of infections.
Late on Friday, Japan's parliament is set to pass a record second supplementary budget that will partly fund a $1.1 trillion stimulus package aimed at getting activity back on track after the health crisis.

1260,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 11:18PM ET</span>",Europe Warned Against Free Virus Bailouts for Zombie Banks,"(Bloomberg) -- The top European official in charge of handling failing banks warned against using taxpayer money to rescue lenders that were barely surviving before the coronavirus pandemic.
With the economic fallout from the virus pushing the limits on state aid in Europe, Elke Koenig said handing out targeted aid to banks “shouldn’t mean now we’re back to bailouts.”
The question that needs to be asked is “what is a corona-related issue and what is perhaps an underlying problem which was only getting the last kick via corona,” Koenig, who heads the Single Resolution Board in Brussels, said in an interview.
Koenig’s position will be crucial to the debate on the subject, which will likely heat up as business failures reverberate through the economy and blow a hole in banks’ balance sheets. The European Central Bank and other authorities have so far extended unprecedented relief to the industry, allowing banks to dip into capital buffers and tweaking rules in a hurry to ensure they can continue to lend.
Governments used trillions of euros to prop up banks during the financial crisis, becoming direct shareholders in some institutions. More than a decade later, the German government still owns some 15% of Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY).
Koenig’s SRB was set up in 2015 along with a new European framework to make sure failing banks are treated equally across the region, while sparing taxpayers to the largest extent possible. Politicians still found various ways to avoid imposing losses on investors, using public money to prop up struggling lenders in recent years.
The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said in March that aid given to banks to compensate for “direct damage” suffered as a result of the virus wouldn’t be subject to the usual constraints. Rules were also loosened for many other parts of the economy, and governments have used this leeway to prop up airlines and hand out hundreds of billions of euros in loan guarantees.
Koenig also said that proposals from some European officials to set up an EU-wide bad bank to buy soured loans are premature and probably unworkable because they’d hand a manager a “hodgepodge” of assets. “I’m not very much convinced that a broad bank that is then collecting from everywhere is a manageable solution,” she said.
Andrea Enria, the head of the ECB’s supervisory arm, pushed the idea in 2017 and said recently that he still thinks it could be a useful tool in case of a “significant, system-wide deterioration of asset quality.”
While lenders entered the latest recession with much higher capital cushions than before the financial crisis, they’ve been grappling with low profitability and -- especially in some southern countries -- high levels of bad loans.
Koenig said it’s “broadly realistic” to expect some banks to struggle late this year and in 2021. “Will this be institutions that you will have to declare failing or likely to fail? I don’t know. We are now just monitoring it,” she said.

1261,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 09:20PM ET</span>","Google's new rules clamp down on discriminatory housing, job ads","By Paresh Dave
OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google said on Thursday it was tackling unlawful discrimination by barring housing, employment and credit ads from being targeted to its users based on their postal code, gender, age, parental status or marital status.
The new policy, which will take effect by the end of the year in the United States and Canada, comes more than a year after the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) charged  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) for selling discriminatory housing ads and said it was looking into similar concerns about Google and  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR). 
Google and Facebook together account for just over half of internet ad sales globally, making their policy actions influential in the industry.
U.S. protests following the death of George Floyd, an African American man who died in police custody in Minneapolis, have placed a spotlight on racial inequities, including the challenges black people face in finding jobs and housing. But Google said its new policy was not a reaction to the protests.
""We had been working constructively with HUD on these issues since last year, and our timeline has not been driven by current events,"" Google spokesperson Elijah Lawal said.
In a press release on Thursday, HUD encouraged other online ad sellers to follow Google's action. Twitter said it had no policy updates to share.
Google had previously barred advertisers from choosing ad targets based on users' race, religion, ethnicity or sexual orientation. But researchers investigating discrimination have said advertisers could still use other data to exclude lower-income individuals and racial minorities from their potential customer pool. 
For example, ZIP codes, which refer to geography, could be a proxy for race as people of similar background sometimes cluster in neighborhoods.

Facebook banned advertisers from using ZIP codes, age and gender to decide who would see ads days before HUD took action last year. The company and U.S. prosecutors said the case, which was referred to a federal court in New York, is ongoing.

1262,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 08:15PM ET</span>","A month into reopening, no clear turn for U.S. economy or pandemic","By Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A month into efforts to broadly reopen the U.S. economy there is little clarity either on the pace and durability of the recovery, or on the ability to convincingly suppress the virus that has killed more than 112,000 Americans.
Data on cellphone traffic, employee time management and weekly unemployment claims point to an ongoing and steady climb back - but one that shows stark divisions among states, and some evidence the spread of the novel coronavirus may be greater in places where economic activity is picking up faster.
The situation may mean tough choices for policymakers in the weeks to come. 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has ruled out another shutdown of the U.S. economy regardless of the trajectory of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus. That will leave it to states and local governments to balance concerns about public health with waning patience across the country for a return to the strict measures taken in March and April to slow the spread of the virus.
At the same time, economic activity is not bouncing back fast or uniformly, slowly sorting the country into potential winners and losers in the pandemic response, and raising the stakes of a debate in Congress over whether to provide more emergency funding to blunt the economic fallout. Deadlines are already passing for aid to some small businesses, and enhanced unemployment benefits expire for many workers in late July. 
Data on small businesses collected by time management firm Homebase shows the dynamic. Companies that have reopened have quickly restored employment to pre-shutdown levels. National averages remain low, Homebase suggested, because so many firms have not been able to reopen at all.
(GRAPHIC: The U.S. reopening - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdpzqgdavw/Pasted%20image%201591876466281.png)
The suspected economic fallout from the virus ""went from a few weeks to a couple of months to 'oh my gosh what does the world look like forever?'"" said Julia Coronado, president of research firm MacroPolicy Perspectives. ""It kind of creeps in both for an employee and a firm. Temporary furloughs rotate to permanent reductions ... If you are in a social-contact profession, it might feel like you have to make a choice between economic well-being and health ... This will take place over time.""
CONFLICTING DATA
Nationally, foot traffic at retail stores last week was solidly within 20% of 2019 levels, according to cellphone data company Unacast, while time management firms Homebase and Kronos said more people were working across industries. At the April peak of social-distancing restrictions, activity was down in excess of 50%. 
Weekly unemployment data pointed in the same direction on Thursday, with initial claims for jobless benefits falling last week and continuing claims declining for the week ended May 30, a possible sign that reopened businesses are bringing back some workers.
But the regional variation in the retail traffic numbers was striking. About a third of U.S. states, on a line from Montana southeast to Alabama, showed a full recovery, according to Unacast data. 
Meanwhile, the coastal and mostly Democratic-leaning states that were hit earlier and harder by the pandemic have seen little rebound. Since a March 13 national emergency was declared, 19 states have not had a day in which estimated retail traffic reached 2019 levels. Fourteen of them are on the coasts. 
Those states, however, on the whole have seen steadier progress in tamping down the growth in new coronavirus cases, according to a Reuters analysis of the week-to-week change in case growth. 
Of three week-to-week changes measured over the last 28 days, states showing the least recovery in retail foot traffic reduced the growth in coronavirus cases an average of two of the previous three weeks. The average for other states was just 1.3 weeks of the past three.
The conflicting data around the path of the economic recovery and the trajectory of the virus will likely vex analysts and policymakers for weeks to come. 
That puzzle was at the heart of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks following the end of the U.S. central bank's latest policy meeting on Wednesday. Powell said high unemployment could linger for years as the country wages a state-by-state, city-by-city fight to keep the virus at bay until a vaccine or other broad treatment is found.

1263,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 08:00PM ET</span>",Japanese women bear brunt of recession as pandemic unravels Abe's 'Womenomics',"By Eimi Yamamitsu and Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has long made creating jobs for women central to his economic policy, but now women are suffering a bigger share of the pain as the country heads for its worst economic slump since World War Two.
Helped by a worker shortage, female labour participation hit a decade-high of more than 70% under Abe's campaign, often dubbed ""Womenomics"". The catch: many women lack the job security of male workers, with more than half holding vulnerable part-time, contract or temporary jobs. 
The number of such ""non-regular"" workers posted its biggest drop on record in April, declining by 970,000 to 2.02 million. Women accounted for 710,000 of the decline.
That makes women workers ""the shock absorber"" of the world's third-largest economy, said Mari Miura, a Sophia University political science professor. Only about one in five male workers hold non-regular jobs.
Temp worker Miyuki was told in April she would lose her job on a farm-equipment assembly line at the end of the next month, so she quit to take another offer. But that job disappeared too as the coronavirus outbreak ravaged the economy. 
She's since found work packing products for a drug company -for half the pay and only through July. Now she's waiting on a 100,000 yen ($935) stimulus payment from the government and has gotten rid of her car to cut expenses.
""I want a job,"" said Miyuki, 53, who, like other workers interviewed, declined to give her last name out of privacy concerns. ""No matter how much the government says it will provide financial support, we don't know how long the coronavirus will last."" 
She said wanted more stable employment, but added, ""at my age, it can be tough."" 
'A BIG SHOCK'
Single mothers, many below the poverty line, are hit hard. 
Asami, 32, a single mother in central Japan, lost her job doing piecework for a plastics company in April after asking for time off to care for her sons, ages 4 and 1.
""It was a big shock economically,"" said Asami, who has yet to receive an application form for the government payment. 
""I can't help but wish support was speedier and more substantial,"" Asami said. She has since found a job with an employer who promises to be more flexible about childcare.
An extra government budget to be passed soon contains added one-time subsidies for single mothers, but the plight of other women workers has received less attention.
""Women are viewed as working to supplement the income of male bread-winners, so even if they lose their jobs, men are viewed as their safety net,"" said Mieko Takenobu, professor emeritus at Wako University in Tokyo. ""Reality is different."" 
Government support funnelled through companies to protect jobs and income during the slump often fails to reach women in unstable posts, experts say.
""There's a huge gap between regular and non-regular workers - those who can work at home and get paid even if productivity drops versus those who get no salary if they don't work,"" said Chieko Akaishi, the head of the non-profit Single Mothers Forum. 
Abe has ended a nationwide state of emergency, but worries persist and an economic recovery will take time.
""There will be lots more layoffs,"" said Naoko Mogi, founder of a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group for single women with non-permanent jobs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The deployment of thousands of National Guard troops in response to protests on the streets of Washington, endorsed by President Donald Trump and much criticized by the city's mayor, cost the federal government $2.6 million per day at its peak, U.S. officials told Reuters. 
A Reuters analysis of National Guard data showed that over the course of a week starting June 1, the deployments cost about $14.5 million. 
At the peak, about 1,200 D.C. National Guard troops and 3,900 from other states were sent to the capital to back law enforcement during demonstrations that erupted over the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after being pinned beneath a white officer’s knee for nearly nine minutes. 
Blazes erupted near the White House on May 31 as protests flared up in the district.
Democratic U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen called Trump's use of states' National Guard troops against people peacefully protesting ""an affront to our Constitution"" and an example of Republicans undermining the District of Columbia's right to self-governance. 
""The Administration's use of taxpayer dollars to deploy National Guard troops and transfer active-duty military – and their refusal to provide details on these costs – is unacceptable,"" the Maryland senator said in a statement to Reuters. 
Van Hollen will be asking the Pentagon in coming days for a formal answer on how much the National Guard deployment cost, an aide said. 
Last week, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he did not support invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy active-duty forces to quell civil unrest, after Trump threatened to militarize the U.S. response to mass protests. 
The Pentagon recommended that the National Guard be deployed instead of active-duty troops to halt the unrest, according to a senior U.S. official. It also called for neighboring states to deploy their Guards to the capital.
Two U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said it cost about $530 per Guard member, per day to be deployed. 
The D.C. National Guard said in a statement that the cost per day of up to 5,000 National Guard members was about $2.65 million.
It was unclear if this included the cost of transportation and whether the costs would have been incurred as part of annual Guard training anyway.
A spokeswoman for Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said the district had not been involved with paying for the National Guard troops. 
A third U.S. official said that the federal government had borne the cost of the deployments. 
The National Guard in Washington, D.C., is the only one in the country that reports to the President, with the authority delegated to the Army secretary. 
In a letter dated June 4 to Trump, Bowser formally requested the withdrawal of ""all extraordinary federal law enforcement and military presence from Washington, D.C.""

All non-D.C. National Guard troops deployed to Washington were to leave the city by Wednesday.

The spending plan for the year starting July 1, due to be presented in Parliament Friday, will be a tough balancing act of reviving economic growth without depleting the coffers.
A year after winning a $6 billion International Monetary Fund loan to fend off a balance-of-payments crisis, Khan found himself seeking debt relief and another loan to fight the fallout of Covid-19. A locust-invasion that threatens 40% of the nation’s major crops came as an added challenge for the economy where half of the workforce depends on agriculture for a livelihood.
The hit to business activity from the virus has already pushed the economy to its first annual contraction in 68 years. The magnitude of economic losses will depend on the intensity and duration of Covid-19, the finance ministry said in its annual economic report released Thursday.
Here’s a look at what to watch in Khan’s budget:

1266,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 06:18PM ET</span>",European Banks Are Set for Relief on Sovereign Bond Holdings,"(Bloomberg) -- European banks are close to receiving capital relief on their holdings of sovereign debt as lawmakers bolster a package of measures intended to protect the industry from aftershocks of the coronavirus pandemic.
The European Union’s 27 member states agreed this week to sign off on legislation that would offset the “considerable negative impact” on capital requirements from any losses on government bonds, according to a document seen by Bloomberg News that summarizes the deal.
High volatility in sovereign bond markets is threatening to crimp banks’ lending capacity, according to the document, as governments around the world count on lenders to keep credit flowing through the economy. A so-called prudential filter would temporarily free banks from taking a hit to their capital ratios should their portfolios of government debt shrink in value.
A panel of lawmakers in the European Parliament in Brussels also supported the legislation this week, putting it on course for final agreement within days. Spain and Italy were among the main backers of the policy as debate proceeded in recent weeks, according to a separate document.
This newest measure is a late addition to a package of relief that’s designed to soften the burdens of regulation on banks. Lenders will get a big break on leverage restrictions, additional flexibility to deal with non-performing loans, and savings on capital when they invest in software and lend to small business.
Prices of bonds issued by countries including Spain and Italy fell significantly in the wake of the virus outbreak. A 1.35 trillion-euro ($1.53 trillion) asset-purchase program by the European Central Bank and an EU plan for a joint fiscal response restored some calm to the markets in recent weeks.
The ECB has also moved to support financial firms since the crisis outbreak, including giving investment banks’ trading desks a break on capital rules for market risks. Banks have lobbied for years to roll back 2008 crisis-era regulations designed to make them safer, and many of those wishes are being granted to give them greater flexibility, though the ECB has said the relief will be temporary.
The latest measures may especially benefit Italian banks which have large holdings of the country’s bonds. Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) has about 100 billion euros of sovereign debt, including insurance and banking assets, making it the second-biggest creditor of the state after the ECB, CEO Carlo Messina said earlier this month.

1267,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 05:27PM ET</span>",Rescuing State-Owned Firms Adds to Emerging Market Debt Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market economies are grappling with a new dilemma as they begin the slow journey to recovery: how to rescue state-owned businesses without also triggering a debt crisis.
Cash-strapped governments in Indonesia, India, South Africa and elsewhere are being pressured to bail out national airlines, energy utilities and other state businesses brought to their knees by virus-related travel restrictions, collapsing demand and plunging oil prices. The debt risk is putting credit rating companies on watch and prompting nervous investors to sell off assets before the situation gets any worse.
In emerging markets, state-owned enterprises, or SOEs, are key job creators, woven tightly into the economic fabric and even the national identity. They are responsible for 55% of infrastructure investment in those countries, according to the International Monetary Fund, and account for about 60% of non-financial corporate debt, the Institute of International Finance estimates.
“Governments tend to provide significant support to these pseudo-private entities to pursue policy goals,” said Emre Tiftik, a director at the IIF in Washington. “During stress episodes, they are key to generate employment, though this happens at the cost of low productivity.”
Against this backdrop, there’s likely to be a further build-up in SOE debt going forward, said Tiftik. “The implications of this rise will be long-lasting and will weigh on potential growth in the medium-to-long-term,” he said.
Fiscal deficits are already soaring as governments boost spending to prop up growth, but those figures often don’t capture the true liabilities that authorities face if they need to step in to support or rescue state-owned enterprises.
Deficit Blowouts
In Indonesia, a 3% deficit ceiling imposed in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis more than two decades ago was recently abandoned, and a target of 6.3% of gross domestic product set for this year. India’s deficit is set for a blowout to more than 7% of GDP, and the IMF predicts South Africa’s shortfall could be double the 6.8% the government projected before the virus outbreak.
India now is teetering on the edge of junk status by all three major credit ratings agencies, while Indonesia is in only a slightly more secure positioning. The likes of South Africa and Turkey already are in speculative grade by Moody’s Investor Service, Fitch Ratings Ltd., and S&P Global Ratings.
For many countries, rising SOE debt was a problem well before the coronavirus began spreading. In some cases, governments were already bailing out struggling businesses, as in the case of South Africa’s power utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. and its national airline, South African Airways. In Indonesia, two state insurers defaulted on payments to policyholders earlier this year and Krakatau Steel, the nation’s largest steelmaker, teetered on the brink of bankruptcy.

India Banks
The pandemic has only amplified those risks.
In India, state-run banks pose a huge headache for authorities. The banking industry has one of the world’s worst stressed-asset ratios at 9.3%. The government has already pumped in 2.6 trillion rupees ($34 billion) into its public-sector banks in the three years to March 2020, and may be forced to do more.
Ashish Gupta, a banking sector analyst at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG in Mumbai, estimates Indian banks will need to raise about $20 billion this year to keep capital buffers fresh, with public-sector units needing about $13 billion in recapitalization from the government.
In Indonesia, which has more than 100 state-owned firms, the government has set aside $10 billion in financial support for several SOEs, including for its national carrier PT Garuda Indonesia. Deputy Finance Minister Suahasil Nazara told investors on a conference call recently that PT Hutama Karya, which is building highways in the country, may need aid, but that any direct financial assistance would be “fairly limited” and “not every single problem will be handled with a capital injection.”
Eskom Bailouts
For South Africa, the government is already deep into propping up Eskom, one of its most critical state-owned firms generating about 95% of the nation’s electricity. Eskom was relying on bailouts even before the pandemic to make interest payments on its 450 billion rand ($27 billion) of debt. About 350 billion rand of that pile is guaranteed by the government.
With authorities planning to limit future support, Eskom’s borrowing costs have soared. The yield on the company’s 2028 dollar bonds have climbed 177 basis points since the beginning of January to 8.98%.
One saving grace for governments is that global interest rates are low for now, said Taimur Baig and Ma Tieying, economists at DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) Holdings Ltd. in Singapore.
“But that also means GDP and revenue growth will be low,” they wrote in a report. “The ongoing debt binge, much of it inevitable this year, pose plenty of risks for the future.”

(Reuters) - The New York Federal Reserve is slightly raising the price of its operations in the market for repurchase agreements, or repo, after seeing ""substantial improvements"" in market conditions, the bank announced on Thursday. 
Beginning next Tuesday, the minimum rate on the Fed's overnight repo operations will be set at 0.05 percentage point above the interest rate on excess reserves (IOER), or the rate that the Fed pays to banks holding balances at the central bank. Currently, the minimum bid rate for overnight repo is equal to the IOER. 
Starting June 22, the New York Fed will shift to offering overnight repo operations in the afternoon instead of the morning. The Fed will also stop publishing daily updates on its planned repo operations, directing people who need more details to visit its website https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details. 
The central bank's interventions in money markets go back to mid-September, when a shortage of liquidity led to a temporary spike in short-term interest rates. The Fed began to scale back those operations at the start of this year but had to ramp them back up in March after concerns about the rapidly spreading coronavirus roiled markets. 

Fed officials pledged after the policy setting meeting this week to keep monitoring money markets and adjust its support as needed.

1269,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 05:09PM ET</span>",BOJ’s Help for Banks Still Leaves Resistance to Negative Rate,"(Bloomberg) -- Trillions of yen of financial support hasn’t been enough to win over Japan’s commercial banks, with the majority of lenders still vehemently opposed to the central bank’s negative interest rate policy.
While the Bank of Japan’s 75 trillion yen ($700 billion) of measures to prop up lending during the pandemic are welcome help, senior banking sector officials interviewed by Bloomberg said the prevailing view in the industry remains that the profit-draining negative rate should never be lowered and should be scrapped altogether.
The comments suggest that even in the middle of an economic crisis, the hurdle for the BOJ to make greater use of its interest rate policy remains extremely high, with other central banks around the world also feeling reluctant to lower or experiment with negative rates.
The BOJ next meets on June 15-16 and is not expected to lower the 0.1% rate or take any new measures. In response to the virus so far, the bank has pledged unlimited purchases of government bonds, expanded its exchange-traded fund buying and launched two interest-free lending programs.
Most Economists See No Major Action From BOJ in June: Survey
For the country’s commercial banks, the BOJ’s sub-zero rates strategy aimed at stimulating the economy and prices has eroded their profit margins. That’s created a frosty relationship between policy makers and banking executives who think the low rates are doing more harm than good.
Kanetsugu Mike, who represents the 117 banks of the Japanese Bankers Association, has raised the issue of squeezed margins, largely following the line of previous chairmen of the industry group.
“The profit environment of not only banks but all financial institutions has become severe as interest rates fell and the yield curve flattened,” Mike, who is also chief executive of MUFG Bank, said at his inaugural press conference in April.
Between the years ended March 2016 and March 2019, domestic net interest income at the association’s banks fell to 5.9 trillion yen from 6.4 trillion yen. The average net interest margin, a gauge of lending profitability, has narrowed to 1.08% among among lenders on the Topix Banks Index, from 1.23% when the negative rate policy was introduced in 2016.
Welcome Help
The central bank deserves high marks for its actions since March to alleviate market tensions through the provision of liquidity, especially its dollar supplying, said a senior executive at one of Japan’s biggest three banks, echoing comments by two other megabank executives.But the central bank also had an obligation to do this because its negative rate policy forced banks to look abroad for business, heightening their need for dollar supplies, the executive added.
For smaller regional banks, the central bank’s lending programs have been of greater importance than its dollar provision, helping them supply funds to keep companies afloat as the pandemic hammers the economy.
The BOJ conducted hearings with banks and tailored the program to their needs, said a senior regional bank official. In particular, the banks applauded the decision to pay 0.1% interest on reserves at the BOJ matching the amount banks lent out from their free BOJ loans, the official added.
Still, the three megabank executives and three regional bank officials Bloomberg spoke to all said the BOJ should end the negative rate policy.
Despite the ongoing resistance within the banking community to the policy, the central bank insists that a rate cut remains a live option.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said in May that lowering the negative rate still wasn’t necessary at that time. But with the economy expected to suffer its biggest contraction in more than six decades this quarter, the central bank may need to take more action in the coming months.The BOJ is aware of the side effects piling up from its prolonged low interest-rate regime. At the same time, BOJ officials aren’t sure if raising rates to zero or above would even help banks if that resulted in the economy tanking more, the yen strengthening and stocks tumbling, according to people familiar with the matter.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg in June said it would take an export-damaging yen move beyond 98 against the dollar to prompt the BOJ to lower the rate. The dollar was changing hands at around 107 yen on Thursday afternoon, some distance from that level.
Some economists say the greater use of negative rates abroad might be the only likely factor that would force the BOJ to go lower.Either way, the BOJ’s loan programs haven’t budged the viewpoint in commercial bank boardrooms, the banking officials said.
The virus loan assistance and the negative rate need to be looked at separately, said another of the regional bank officials. The loan help doesn’t simply give the BOJ free rein to do whatever it likes with negative rates, the official said.

1271,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>",China hits back at U.S. telecom supply chain order at WTO,"By Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of undermining the global tech industry's supply chains with a renewed executive order barring U.S. companies from using telecoms equipment made by firms deemed to pose a national security risk.
Jiankai Jin, a diplomat at China's mission to the World Trade Organization, denounced the U.S. move during closed door multilateral talks at the body's headquarters in Geneva.
""We would also like to know how the U.S. will ensure measures taken under this Executive Order will not abuse the WTO national security exception and be consistent with WTO rules,"" Jin said, according to a transcript reviewed by Reuters.
He did not indicate whether China would launch a formal dispute.
The U.S. delegation said Thursday's meeting of the WTO's Goods Council was not the appropriate forum to discuss national security issues, a Geneva-based trade official said.
Last month, President Donald Trump extended for another year an executive order signed in May 2019 declaring a national emergency and barring U.S. companies from using telecoms equipment made by firms posing a national security risk.
U.S. lawmakers said Trump’s order was aimed squarely at Chinese companies Huawai and ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063). 
Washington is also trying to convince allies to exclude Huawei from phone networks on grounds its equipment could be used by China for spying, which Huawei, the world's biggest telecoms equipment maker, has repeatedly denied.
Jin said: ""The global ICT industry, including U.S. companies, is worried about the vague and broad wording of the above Executive Order and implementation rules.""
""Unfortunately, at the time of crisis, the U.S. continued to restrict legitimate competition and interfere with the global ICT industry, which would undermine the stability of the global supply chain and cause huge losses to related ICT companies in many countries,"" Jin added.

The United States last month moved to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei from global chipmakers.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - New Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem, already facing the double whammy of the coronavirus pandemic and slumping oil prices, must now also contend with the Federal Reserve forecast that the United States expects years of slow growth.
Some 75% of the goods that Canada exports go to the United States, which like Canada is grappling with historic losses in output and jobs caused by COVID-19 shutdowns. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday the United States faced ""a long road"" to recovery and the Fed forecast interest rates languishing near zero through 2022. 
Macklem will take the lead on the bank's July 15 rate decision, officially his first, when it could also give new economic forecasts. The Bank of Canada said this month second quarter GDP would decline a further 10%-20% from the fourth quarter of 2019, but noted growth could pick up again in the third quarter of 2020. It slashed rates three times to a record low 0.25% in March.
""Something we have to keep in mind is the coronavirus shock for Canada is coming along with an oil price shock,"" said Josh Nye, senior economist at RBC Economics. 
""That's perhaps a reason to expect that the Bank of Canada might need to keep policy stimulative for at least as long or longer than the Fed is going to.""
Before being named governor in May, Macklem told Reuters the oil price decline may hammer Canada long after the coronavirus slump has passed.
With Macklem firmly in his new role, all eyes are on whether the bank will reintroduce tables and forecasts on July 15, after suspending forecasts in April amid the uncertainty.

""The Fed's projections probably put a bit more pressure on the bank to revert to publishing these elements ... sooner rather than later,"" said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The reality that the coronavirus crisis is far from over is threatening a blistering equity market rally that had taken some world indexes to fresh highs.
Global stocks tumbled on Thursday and bonds rallied on fears a rise in new coronavirus cases could hurt a rush to open economies. Lockdown measures to curb the virus' spread had triggered a prolonged economic slowdown, a threat investors broadly looked past in recent weeks as they focused on improving data and support from the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
But on Wednesday, market participants cited concerns about U.S. states such as Texas, Florida and Arizona, which were seeing a fresh surge in cases.
""Those who were expecting more of a V-shaped recovery are taking that expectation down this morning in light of the new evidence,"" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Wealth Management. ""Right now, it feels like there’s a fragility around the latest rally.""
Total U.S. coronavirus cases surpassed 2 million on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally.
A Reuters analysis earlier in the week showed twenty-one U.S. states reported weekly increases in new cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, with Arizona, Utah and New Mexico all posting a jump of 40% or more for the week ended June 7 compared with the prior seven days. New cases in Florida, Arkansas, South Carolina and North Carolina all rose by more than 30% in the past week.
Rising cases ""can quite easily reclaim the news headlines especially if there is a second round of lockdowns in certain U.S. states,"" said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James.
The market declines came after a sharp rally which had seen the Nasdaq index hit a new high and the benchmark S&P climb to within 5.8% of its record high. World stocks had risen to just 7% off prior peaks but were on Thursday down 2.6%, the sharpest one-day drop in two months.
Part of the euphoria in equity markets had been justified by the equity risk premium -- essentially stocks' excess future return over risk-free rates -- which has risen, given bond yields are near historic lows.
Fund managers had turned increasingly bullish, driven by a confidence that the Fed would do whatever it takes, as well as a fear of missing out on the rally.

High-profile hedge fund managers Paul Tudor Jones and Stan Druckenmiller said recently they were becoming more bullish on the stock market, reversing their previous reluctance to buy into the rally. Jones' speech, reported by Bloomberg, was at the Economic Club of New York, and Druckenmiller spoke to CNBC. 
The novel coronavirus has ravaged the global economy. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) forecast the global economy to contract 7.6% if there is a second wave of infections. Latin America has emerged as a hotspot, with a grim new milestone in the region of total deaths exceeding 70,000, according to a Reuters count.
Bolstering the case for optimism in the U.S. had been positive economic news. A closely watched monthly jobs report on Friday showed an unexpected fall in the unemployment rate. 
""I guess people were assuming and acting like COVID-19 is something of the past, but it is actually still quite present,"" said Stephane Ekolo, an equity strategist at TFS Derivatives in London. 
U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said it was evident that if there were a second wave of the virus, it could hurt the economic recovery. Still, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday the United States could not let the coronavirus shut down its economy again.
Market participants also said a rise in infections may not equate to more lockdowns. Edmund Shing, global head of equity derivatives strategy at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), said rising U.S. infections were not in the hardest-hit states like New York. 
""Does it mean they need a second lockdowns? My guess is for most parts probably not,"" Shing said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has withdrawn European Arrest Warrants against three German traders and one Frenchman after closing an eight-year investigation into allegations that bankers manipulated global Euribor interest rates.
The SFO updated its website on Thursday to confirm that it had ended its case against Joerg Vogt, Ardalan Gharagozlou, Kai-Uwe Kappauf and Stephane Esper. Lawyers for Gharagozlou and Kappauf declined to comment. Esper and Vogt's legal representatives were not immediately available for comment.
The decision brings to a close a string of high-profile prosecutions after an investigation into allegations that bankers rigged two key interest rate benchmarks, Libor (London interbank offered rate) and its Brussels-based Euribor equivalent.
The Euribor investigation proved the trickiest for the SFO. The agency originally wanted to charge 11 individuals, but only seven faced trial. London juries acquitted three and convicted four, but one absconded.
The SFO was granted European Arrest Warrants for four men in 2016 after they declined to attend a London court to be formally charged. Germany and France refused to extradite the men.
The decision draws a line under a saga that began with the prosecution of former UBS (S:UBSG) and  Citigroup  (N:C) star trader Tom Hayes, who was sentenced to 14 years in 2015 over Libor rigging before his sentence was cut to 11 years on appeal.
Hayes, who is due to be released next January after serving half his term, continues to fight his conviction.
Euribor and Libor rates were designed to reflect the cost of borrowing between banks. But regulators announced plans to scrap Libor after some of the world's top banks reached settlements with authorities over allegations of rate manipulation.
Aziz Rahman, a partner at law firm Rahman Ravelli, said the case had reached its ""natural ending.""

Britain left the world's largest trading bloc on Jan. 31 and has made very little progress in talks about a Brexit free trade agreement, negotiators from both sides concluded after the latest round of talks on Friday.
Stefaan de Rynck told a virtual Irish conference that Britain had shown a lack of serious engagement on a number of issues and the talks needed to be unblocked.

LEDNICE, Czech Republic (Reuters) - Central Europe's four-nation Visegrad Group on Thursday edged towards backing an EU plan to fund recovery from the coronavirus but said it should not favour larger, richer states or hurt smaller ones that managed the outbreak well.
The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia met on Thursday to hash out a joint position as tough talks between the European Union's 27 member states over a 750-billion-euro recovery plan comprising loans and grants begin.
The Visegrad quartet have reported far fewer cases of the COVID-19 respiratory disease than larger, wealthier western neighbours but face a harsh recession this year because shutdowns to contain the contagion hammered their economies.
Under recovery plans at the forefront of the next seven-year EU budget, major western member states Italy and Spain - which have suffered the highest coronavirus tolls in the EU - would receive the most money.
Poland would get the third highest amount, which has made it an early supporter. The Czech Republic and Hungary have been more sceptical as they would receive less than Germany, which recorded far fewer deaths than other western EU peers but boasts the largest, most advanced economy in the bloc.
The Visegrad allies narrowed differences after meeting at a Czech chateau in Lednice, where the Czechs and Hungarians muted opposition to the plan and its size while soliciting support for their demands to get more.
""Poorer countries should not bear the cost for richer ones,"" Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said Budapest was opposed to large borrowing - at the core of the EU recovery plan - but would get on board if funding is distributed more favourably.
""Our attitude to that the proposal is positive...Desperate times call for desperate measures. Philosophical convictions with respect to the economy must be put aside in such times,"" Orban said. 

The Visegrad four agreed that one source of money could be complex budget rebates received by several rich EU nations, saying they were no longer justified after Britain exited the bloc early this year.

1279,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 11:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Britain asks private bankers to discuss potential wealth taxes - source,"By Sinead Cruise and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's finance ministry is canvassing private bankers over how the country's richest citizens might help pay for the soaring cost of coronavirus relief packages, with potential tax hikes likely to sit high on the agenda.
Government officials are contacting executives at major banks and wealth management firms to sound them out on options to replenish depleted public coffers, according to one senior banker invited to share their views.
Britain's emergency public spending surge and tax cuts in response to the pandemic are forecast to cost around 133 billion pounds this financial year and lift its budget deficit to wartime levels, the country's fiscal watchdog has said.
The government is weighing whether Britain's rich - who on some measures have got wealthier while many lower income citizens have suffered hardship in the crisis - should pay more to plug the gap.
Some wealth managers and economists speculate the government could look to raise money via tax hikes on savings, capital gains, Value Added Tax (VAT) or property, although the banker had not been provided with any detail on the exact policies under review.
""[The government] is reaching out. Have decisions already been made before this? I would hope not. I hope the reaching out is bona fide and there's a willingness to listen and for dialogue and to change position if necessary,"" the banker said.
Other bankers said the government was keen to encourage clients to buy government bonds or channel more equity into company start-ups that might otherwise struggle to find funding.
While the government engages often with the banking industry - particularly in the current crisis including over state-backed loans delivered by banks - it is unusual for officials to consult private bankers on policy matters.
A Treasury spokesman said: ""The Government keeps all aspects of the tax system under review; as we exit the current crisis, we will take stock of the economy and public finances and make the right decisions at that point.""
LOCKDOWN RESTRICTIONS
Britons have been forced to rein in spending due to lockdown restrictions on travel, dining out and shopping.
An analysis last month by think-tank New Policy Institute found households had cut spending by 57 billion pounds since the lockdown, with nearly half of the reduction - 23 billion pounds - accounted for by the top fifth of households by income.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak's next budget is scheduled for the autumn, although reports suggest some limited stimulus measures will be announced next month. 
The governing Conservative Party has traditionally steered clear of fiscal policies that target wealthier Britons because of their historic backing of the party.
But with business unlikely to rebound quickly and international trade potentially stymied by Brexit, higher taxes on affluent citizens or the British assets of overseas investors are seen inevitable by some.

""I think there's a realisation that this has to be paid for and that we are probably going to have to shoulder the burden a bit more than others,"" the banker said, when asked whether his clients had shared worries about tax hikes.

""The 20 richest nations in the world (G-20) have urged bilateral official creditors to provide debt relief to the world's poorest nations including Tanzania,"" Philip Mpango said in parliament.
""The government has began negotiations with creditors to benefit from this initiative."" 
The initiative is geared towards delaying debt repayments beginning May to December 2020, freeing up cash for governments to use for measures to ease the economic impact of COVID-19. 
The announcement comes after the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday said it approved debt relief to Tanzania worth $14.3 million over the next 4 months, and potentially up to $25.7 million over the next 23 months.
""IMF debt service relief will help free up resources for public sector health needs and other emergency spending, as well as mitigate the balance of payments shock resulting from the pandemic,"" it said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States cannot let the coronavirus shut down its economy again, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday, adding that more than $1 trillion in rescue funds will flow into the economy over the next month.
Mnuchin, speaking on CNBC television, said he was prepared to go back to Congress for more money to support the economy, but additional funds would be targeted to sectors with the most need, including hotels, restaurants, travel and entertainment firms.
The Treasury chief, who has been the Trump administration's point man for negotiating rescue programs, said that he was confident that COVID-19 infection spikes in certain areas could be dealt with due to improvements in testing, contact tracing and ample hospital capacity.
""We can't shut down the economy again. I think we've learned that if you shut down the economy, you're going to create more damage and not just economic damage,"" he said, adding that this includes other problems.
Mnuchin said of the $3 trillion in coronavirus rescue spending approved by Congress this year, only about $1.6 trillion has filtered through the economy so far.
""Over the next month, you're going to see over another $1 trillion pumped into the economy, that's going to have a big impact,"" Mnuchin said. The Federal Reserve's Main Street Lending program for mid-size businesses is just getting started and ""we're prepared to go back to Congress for more money to support the American worker,"" he added.
Asked if he was considering more aid to states, Mnuchin said that would be subject to negotiations with Congress.

Mnuchin added that due to an extension of forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loans to 24 weeks, he expects many restaurants that had previously been reluctant to seek loans will come forward to take up a significant portion of the program's remaining funds.

1283,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>","Coronavirus spreads among fruit and vegetable packers, worrying U.S. officials","By Mica Rosenberg, Kristina Cooke and Christopher Walljasper
NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES/CHICAGO (Reuters) - From apple packing houses in Washington state to farm workers in Florida and a California county known as ""the world's salad bowl,"" outbreaks of the novel coronavirus are emerging at U.S. fruit and vegetable farms and packing plants.
A rising number of sick farm and packing house workers comes after thousands of meat plant employees contracted the virus and could lead to more labor shortages and a fresh wave of disruption to U.S. food production.
The Trump administration said last month it may extend an executive order to keep meat plants operating to fruit and vegetable producers as well, a sign it is concerned fresh produce could be the next sector hit.
While social distancing can be more easily implemented for workers harvesting fruits and vegetables in fields and working outside may reduce some risks for virus spread, plants that package foods such as apples and carrots resemble the elbow-to-elbow conditions that contributed to outbreaks at U.S. meat packing plants.
By late May, there were more than 600 cases of COVID-19 among agricultural workers in Yakima County, Washington. Of those, 62% were workers in the apple industry and other packing operations or warehouses, according to a Reuters review of data from county health officials. 
With 4,834 known cases as of June 10, the county had the highest per-capita infection rate on the West Coast. 
""The (production) line moves super fast. And you're working side by side and back to back,"" said Edgar Franks, political director with local farmworker union Familias Unidas por la Justicia in Washington state.
Workers at six fruit packing sites in Yakima County went on strike in May due to concerns they were not being provided adequate protection from COVID-19, Franks said. 
The health department in Monterey County, California, known as ""the world's salad bowl"" for its sprawling vegetable farms, reported 247 agricultural workers had tested positive for coronavirus as of June 5, 39% of county's total cases. Monterey is one of only a handful of health departments in nearly 30 of the largest U.S. fruit and vegetable producing counties that tracks virus cases among agricultural workers, Reuters found.
In adjacent Kern county, Martin Baca, a 53 year-old forklift operator at carrot grower Grimmway Farms died on April 30, according to his obituary. His family said they believe he contracted the virus at work. 
    Grimmway grieved the loss of an employee and was supporting the family, a spokesperson said. The company said it did not definitively know where Baca contracted COVID-19. 
Grimmway is the largest carrot producer in the world and dominates the market of popular packaged ""baby carrots,"" for snacking.
    Juan, a Grimmway employee who asked to be identified only by his first name out of fear of losing his job, said at one point so many workers were out sick his shift dwindled to a third of the needed workers. 
    ""They made some announcements to stay six feet apart but that's basically impossible when you are loading boxes onto the same pallet,"" said Juan, who tested positive for coronavirus himself though he showed no symptoms. ""Obviously you are going to be close to your co-workers.""  
    Grimmway declined to say how many workers had tested positive for the virus and said it has seen no issues of absenteeism. When a worker falls ill, the company talks to everyone working on that particular shift or department and offers company-funded COVID testing, Grimmway said in a statement.
Carrot sales at U.S. stores rose 22% from a year ago in the 13 weeks to May 30, according to Nielsen data, as Americans bought nearly all their food from supermarkets with restaurants closed during coronavirus lockdowns. 
'GET AHEAD OF THIS'
    On May 19 the U.S. Agriculture Department and Food and Drug Administration said the government could use the Defense Production Act to keep fruit and vegetable lines moving. The act would give companies some liability protection if workers fall sick. 
    An FDA spokesperson said the act could be used ""to protect the food supply and prevent significant food shortages."" 
U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, said in an interview with Reuters farm workers face increased risks as fruits like apples and cherries enter harvest season.
    Stabenow, ranking member on the Senate Agriculture Committee, introduced legislation on May 27 that would offer companies grants and loans to upgrade machinery and purchase personal protective equipment, fund COVID-19 testing and facility cleaning.
    ""You can get ahead of this, which is what didn't happen in the meatpacking situation,"" she said. ""The best way to protect our supply chain is to keep workers safe."" 
Meanwhile, coronavirus cases near tomato-growing Immokalee, Florida, are also on the rise. The spread of the coronavirus among Florida farm workers has significant implications for national food production, as many agricultural workers travel north through the summer following the harvest through Georgia, the Carolinas, and into the Northeast.
    The Florida Department of Agriculture is planning for more on-farm outbreaks by partnering with county health departments, hotels for quarantine housing, and educating workers.
Lupe Gonzalo, a farm worker from Immokalee, said many laborers can't afford to miss work, meaning many cases among farmworkers go undetected. 

    ""A lot of workers will hide their symptoms, or say it is just a cold or if they have a fever, just say it is too hot outside,"" potentially risking more infection, she said.

1284,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 09:56AM ET</span>",France's 'Generation COVID' faces bleak future with jobs scarce,"By Michaela Cabrera and Caroline Pailliez
PARIS (Reuters) - In September, Eugenie Fillon should begin a two-year master's degree in luxury hotel management that combines academic studies with a salaried apprenticeship. The problem: during the worst economic downturn in decades, hotels in France aren't hiring.
If the 22-year-old fails to secure a placement, not only will she be deprived of a starting income and on-the-job experience. She will also be on the hook for fees worth 18,000 euros.
""Normally there are job offers out there. But there have barely been any since the crisis struck,"" Fillon said, as she scoured online job ads on a park bench in Nantes, in the west of the country.
""When I saw the coronavirus numbers and the borders closed, I wondered 'will a hotel need me next year?'.""
France was already one of the worst places in Europe to be a young job-seeker because of a rigid labour market and resulting shortage of long-term contracts. When the coronavirus hit, finding employment, even as an apprentice, became tougher.
Fillon is not alone. Some 800,000 youngsters in France will enter the labour market this summer, just as the euro zone's second largest economy is forecast to shrink by 11 percent.
France has struggled to provide enough long-term jobs for its young. The youth unemployment rate sat above 20% in the fourth quarter of 2019, the fourth highest in Europe behind Greece, Spain, and Italy, according to the OECD.
Onerous labour laws mean businesses typically prefer to give youngsters short-term contracts that offer scant job security.
But President Emmanuel Macron has pushed through reforms to liberalise France's highly regulated job market and incentivise the hiring of apprentices.
Unemployment was falling before the crisis - even if it was still roughly double the rate in Britain and Germany - and long-term contracts were on the rise. So too apprenticeships, up 17% year-on-year in 2019.
""This crisis has shown the fragility (of the reform gains),"" said Mathieu Plane, an economist at the publicly funded French Economic Observatory (OFCE).
""WORST POSSIBLE TIME""
In France, young employees and job-seekers are suffering a double hit, Plane said. They were typically the first to be jettisoned by companies in times of recession and have an outsized presence in the ailing tourism and hospitality sectors.
The government might have to think about state-subsidised jobs for 15 to 24-year-olds if hiring in the private sector remained low for several years, he added.
Armelle Bahrouni, 23, quit her Paris bar job in February, a month before France went into lockdown, because she wanted to find a hospitality role with a view to one day running a bar.
Four months later, bars and restaurants in Paris can only offer outdoor seating. Many remain closed and Bahrouni is out of work.
""The longest time I've done nothing with my life before this was two months. And even then I did temping jobs,"" Bahrouni said.
Macron's government will in the days ahead hold talks with trade unions and employer groups over how to create jobs for youngsters during the depression.
The need is pressing. The labour ministry anticipates that as many as 320,000 young people will join queues at job-seeker centres. Youth unemployment may hit 30%, it forecasts.
""I entered the job market at the worst possible time,"" said 23-year-old Louis Lhomme, who this summer received a master's in urban planning from Paris' Sciences Po, which for more than a century has been educating France's decision-makers.
Lhomme said he had opted for enrolling in a second master's degree rather than settling for an imperfect job - an option few can afford.

""That will shield me from the worst of the crisis.""

1287,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 09:30AM ET</span>","Brazil central bank still in emergency mode, to cut rates to 2.25%: Reuters poll","By Gabriel Burin
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Brazil's key interest rate is set to fall to a record low of 2.25% on Wednesday as officials extend an emergency drive to reinvigorate economic activity crippled by the coronavirus pandemic, a Reuters poll showed.
The country's central bank will also probably hint at more easing ahead in case the economy worsens further amid a health crisis marked by the third highest death toll from COVID-19 in the world, and a recession without parallel in Brazil.
Political risk could feed into economic weakness in coming months as well. Lawmakers are decrying President Jair Bolsonaro's defiance of public health experts on the virus outbreak and his campaign to end state quarantine measures.
However, the odds Brazil will embark on some sort of quantitative easing bond buying program, or QE, look slim, with policymakers still reluctant to adopt such an extreme strategy at this stage.
The central bank's policy committee, known as Copom, will likely cut the benchmark Selic rate by 75 basis points to 2.25% following a similar move last month, according to the median estimate of 38 economists polled June 8-11.
(Graphic - Reuters Poll: Brazil interest rate and economic outlook: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/rlgvdkblrpo/Brazil%20interest%20rate.PNG)
In May, Brazil's central bank slashed the Selic rate by 75 basis points, its biggest rate cut since October 2017, as it reckoned the economic damage from quarantine steps and business closures would be greater than previously thought.
The expected reduction this month would be the 8th consecutive drop since last July, when officials began lowering rates to stimulate growth in an economy that was already undergoing its weakest recovery ever.
While a majority now see the 2.25% level as a ""lower bound"" for Brazil's rates until the second quarter of 2021, some respondents said the central bank will cut rates again at some point in July-September.
Fifteen out of 20 economists who answered a separate question said the risks to rates were tilted to the downside in the short-term. The remaining five said the outlook for monetary policy was ""neutral"".
""The strong downward trend in inflation expectations and worse-than-expected GDP fall will allow the central bank to cut the Selic rate below a previously-expected floor of 2.25%,"" said Alexandre Lohmann, macro analyst at GO Associados in Sao Paulo.
""Our central forecast is a Selic rate at 1.75% at the end of the year. We are currently considering cutting it to 1.50% depending on the behaviour of the exchange rate and of inflation expectations for 2021"".
Despite a recent recovery in financial asset valuations, real activity figures still reflect dire conditions as Brazil endures its worst economic downturn on record, helping to keep consumer prices under control by suppressing private spending.
A majority of respondents left aside a different query on the potential adoption of QE. The central bank's president, Roberto Campos Neto, has so far held back from launching asset purchases.
This stems in part from fears it could turn into outright money printing and fuel undesired inflation, but also because of the country's lack of experience in using a program like those already tested in developed countries.
""Brazil faces some difficulties before setting up a QE program,"" said Jason Vieira, chief economist at Infinity Asset Management in Sao Paulo. ""Officials would have to determine first what bonds and which market segments should be included.""

""It's not going to be this year, and Brazil's central bank has other priorities like finding ways to ensure policy rate cuts are effectively channeled to consumers and companies that aren't still benefiting from them.""

Lebanon plunged into a $31 billion sovereign default in March, saying it needed to preserve dwindling dollars for vital imports, and has since entered talks with the International Monetary Fund.
Speaking at the presidential palace about an ongoing fuel oil shortage, Energy Minister Raymond Ghajar listed the potential seizure of an oil tanker off its shore by bondholders as among the issues complicating the country's supplies.
""We have been exposed on this issue to several setbacks including what happened about two weeks ago because we weren't able to open credit at the central bank in the required time, so there was a risk that the oil tanker would be subject to seizure by the Eurobond holders,"" said Ghajar.
""We are studying this issue in order to ultimately reach a result that enables the Lebanese state to not be exposed on this matter,"" Ghajar added, according to a presidency statement.
The minister did not mention who the owner of the tanker was and could not immediately be reached for further comment.
An economic rescue plan put forward by Beirut maps out about $83 billion in financial sector losses, but the figures are subject to change depending on the discount taken by foreign and local bondholders.

Beirut is hoping an IMF reform programme can secure billions of dollars in financing and restore economic growth.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Future euro zone bailout programmes should aim more at restoring economic growth rather than focusing mainly on fiscal tightening, and their length should be set accordingly, an independent report commissioned by the bloc's bailout fund said.
""Besides the necessarily ambitious fiscal adjustments to restore budgetary and public debt positions, fostering endogenous growth must be one of the key objectives of every financial assistance programme,"" the report writers, who looked at three euro zone bailout programmes for Greece, said.
Greece lost market access in 2010 after it emerged that its budget deficit in 2009 was equivalent to 15.4% of GDP rather than the 3.7% forecast earlier. Athens had to rely on cheap loans from euro zone governments for almost nine years to finance itself.
The three-year bailouts, designed jointly by the euro zone and the International Monetary Fund, imposed tough reforms and triggered a lot of Greek resentment as they focused strongly on restoring the viability of the country's public finances.
Already in recession in 2008 and 2009, Greece suffered four more years of contracting output after the collapse of its public finances in 2010.
The economy eked out growth in 2014 as the first results of bailout-linked reforms started to show, but plunged back into recession in 2015 and 2016 when the new, left-wing government of Alexis Tsipras decided to go back on already-agreed bailout reforms.
The back-and-forth with Athens frustrated euro zone officials who complained about Greece's inability to implement what had been agreed.
The writers of the report for the ESM bailout fund, entitled ""Lessons from Financial Assistance to Greece"", said future bailouts should foresee such problems.
""The programme design should derive its objectives and length from an analysis of the main problems to be tackled, including societal realities,"" they said. ""Programme duration must hinge on these objectives.""
""Some of the important elements to be assessed in programme design are the degree of the beneficiary country's institutional capacity... The programme should also include an analysis of ...how to adjust the initial timetable to changing circumstances,"" they said.
They also said future bailouts should limit the number of economic problems they are aimed at solving and focus on just a few priorities. There should be less infighting among institutions involved in setting the bailout conditions and better monitoring of continued reform implementation after the bailout ends.

The coronavirus pandemic has worsened already poor relations between Beijing and Washington, with accusations from the Trump administration of a Chinese cover-up and delayed release of information about the outbreak.
""China and the United States should communicate on key issues, and the scope of communication should go back to normal, not just on trade issues,"" Zhu Guangyao, a cabinet adviser and former vice finance minister, told a briefing in Beijing. “We should resume strategic communication at various levels, including politics, diplomacy and economy.”
Liu Huan, another cabinet adviser, said he expected China's economy to rebound sharply in the third quarter of this year.
Liu told reporters after the briefing that he believed China's economic growth could be about 5% in the third quarter, and 3-4% in the whole of 2020.
The economy contracted 6.8% in the first quarter from a year earlier, shrinking for the first time in decades, as the coronavirus outbreak paralysed production and hit spending. 
Reflecting the uncertain outlook, China set no annual growth target this year for the first time since 2002 and pledged more government spending. But expectations of a global recession are compounding the challenges.
The government has set a 2020 budget deficit of at least 3.6% of GDP, up from last year's 2.8%.
It has also fixed the quota on local government special bond issuance at 3.75 trillion yuan, up from 2.15 trillion yuan. The government will also issue 1 trillion yuan in special treasury bonds this year.
Liu said China may need to raise the budget deficit ratio beyond 3.6% if economic pressures increase.
China's net fiscal stimulus could be just over 4 trillion yuan ($566.09 billion), Liu said, in line with Reuters' calculations based on the fiscal measures announced, while Zhu estimated total fiscal funds could be 6.2 trillion yuan.
The room for China to support the economy through fiscal and monetary policies is ""very big"", said Wang Zhaoxing, a third cabinet adviser at the briefing.

Wang said China should prepare for a long battle to prevent and resolve financial risks and control shadow banking and financing to the property sector.

The CPTPP was originally known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which fell apart when the United States withdrew in early 2017. Member countries, including Japan and Canada, signed the CPTPP deal in 2018 without the United States.
Thailand's lower house panel will look into membership of the trade pact within 30 days before presenting its study to the government, committee chairman Werakorn Khumprakob told Reuters on Thursday.
""The government wants to hear opinions from the lower house,"" Werakorn said. ""So we will thoroughly look at advantages and disadvantages of membership before making a conclusion.""
Membership will need parliamentary approval.
Opposition parties and some business groups say tariff-free access to other CPTPP member countries could lead to a flood of agricultural and pharmaceutical imports from some of those countries and harm those industries in Thailand.
The committee will be open to opinions for or against membership of CPTPP - which also counts Australia, Chile and Singapore as members - including from non-government organisations and a joint standing committee on commerce, industry and banking, Werakorn said.

1296,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday, June 11th","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve was pretty downbeat in its assessment of the U.S. economy, and this may increase fears of deflation going forward. The stock market is set to weaken as a result, while crude also heads lower amid fears of a supply glut. All this while concerns are growing about a second wave of the Covid-19 virus. At least initial jobless claims are likely to show an improvement in the employment market, admittedly from a low base. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, June 11th.
1. Fed offers up gloomy outlook; Deflation now a worry?
The Federal Open Market Committee kept rates unchanged Wednesday, with the fed funds range at 0-0.25%, and reiterated its  commitment to maintaining easy monetary policy measures for some time.
""The committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals,"" the Fed said.
This looks like being a long time - just two out of 17 FOMC members expect to see a rate rise before the end of 2022.
The Fed stated that the economy is expected to contract by 6.5% in 2020, and the unemployment rate for the year is expected to come in at 9.3%.
However, it’s the pace of inflation which is likely to be the key driver for future monetary policy, and this was forecast to cool to a rate of 0.8%, down from 1.9% previously. 
In the press conference, Fed chief Jerome Powell “mentioned a weak inflation pressure, however, he did not sound overly concerned,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note. “We, on the other hand, see deflation risks as high and have been flagging it for a while.”
This followed the core Consumer Price Index turning negative Wednesday. It also declined for the third consecutive month, which has never happened before.
The Producer Price Index for May is due at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), and will no doubt be watched closely. It measures the change in the price of goods sold by manufacturers and is a leading indicator of consumer price inflation. 
Analysts estimate the PPI will rise 0.1% for the month of May, a reversal of the 1.3% decline the previous month.
2. Fears of a second coronavirus wave across the U.S.
Fears are starting to grow that the prompt reopening of many states across the U.S. will result in a second wave of infections from the Covid-19 virus, likely causing even more economic damage to a country already in an exceedingly deep recession with millions unemployed.
A few days ago top World Health Organisation official Dr. Hans Kluge warned that the pandemic was not over, and now was the ""time for preparation, not celebration.""
With this mind, Bloomberg reported that Texas had registered 2,504 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, the highest one-day total since the pandemic emerged. Florida also noted 8,553 new cases this week, the most of any seven-day period, while California’s hospitalizations are at their highest since May 13 and have risen in nine of the past 10 days.
“There is a new wave coming in parts of the country,” said Eric Toner, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “It’s small and it’s distant so far, but it’s coming.”
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned only Wednesday that global growth will contract by 7.6% in 2020 if there is a second wave of Covid-19 infections, a bigger hit than the drop of 6% it predicted without a new wave.
3. Weekly jobless claims due
The go-to data to measure the state of the U.S. employment market will be released at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), and initial jobless claims are estimated to be 1.55 million for the week, down from 1.87 million the prior week, as the overall trend on jobs continues to improve with the reopening of businesses.
Unemployment is still above 13%, according to the government's most recent report, the highest since the post-World War II era. Continuing jobless claims are estimated to come in near 20 million, down from 21.5 million the previous week.
The reopening of the U.S. economy is clearly having a positive effect, but there is a very long way to go.  Without an acceleration of hiring it would take another seven months to fully replace the April payroll at the May hiring rate. 
4. Stocks set to open lower; Tech in focus
U.S. stock markets are set to open sharply lower following the downbeat comments from the Federal Reserve Wednesday, with not even the dominant tech sector able to prevent a sharp sea of red.
By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 futures contract was down 496 points or 1.8%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 1.5% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was 1.1% lower.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 had ended a choppy session lower on Wednesday, but the Nasdaq Composite closed above the 10,000 level for the first time, underscoring the rebound in technology-related stocks following the coronavirus rout.
At the forefront of this strength has been Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), with the tech giant this week becoming the first US company to achieve a $1.5 trillion market capitalization.
The tech sector will remain in focus Thursday, as graphics software maker Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) reports earnings. Wall Street is awaiting Adobe's comments on how the Covid-19 pandemic and related business shutdowns affected its cloud computing business, something management warned about in their prior quarter earnings.
5. Crude inventories point to supply glut
Crude oil prices continued to push lower Thursday, as an increase in American crude stockpiles late Wednesday to a record high raised fresh concerns about a potential supply glut, just as the Federal Reserve was cautioning about longer-lasting damage on the economy from the coronavirus.
U.S. commercial crude oil inventories grew by 5.72 million barrels last week, according to the Energy Information Administration. This was very different from the small stock drawdown the market was expecting, but backed up the previous day's report  from the American Petroleum Institute.
“This increase now sees total U.S. commercial crude oil inventories stand at 538 million barrels, surpassing the levels seen back in early 2017, and in fact the highest level going as far back as 1982,” analysts at ING wrote, in a research note.
Global production cuts and the easing of lockdowns in some countries had pushed prices higher after the historic drop below zero in April. But, there are concerns U.S. producers may pump more with crude above $30 a barrel, adding to a glut.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 2.8% at $38.48 a barrel, while the global benchmark Brent was 2.7% lower at $40.62 a barrel.

1297,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 06:09AM ET</span>",Jerome Powell Sees Long Road Ahead for Jobs Market ,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump says the U.S. economy will be back and better than ever next year. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell begs to differ.
In an almost hour-long virtual press conference Wednesday after the Fed left interest rates pinned near zero, Powell repeatedly played down the surprise, welcome news of a pick-up in jobs growth in May that Trump hailed last week as the “greatest comeback in American history.”
Instead the Fed chairman spotlighted the many millions of American still out of work and suggested it would take years for a return to anything like the strong labor market that the U.S. enjoyed before the coronavirus pandemic.
“We have to be honest that it’s a long road,” Powell said. “It’s -- depending on how you count it -- well more than 20 million people displaced in the labor market.”
Just how long a road it will be was seen in the forecasts that policy makers released after their two-day meeting. While they expect the economy to begin to recover from its government-imposed lockdown in the second half of the year, they see unemployment falling slowly – to 9.3% at the end of this year from May’s 13.3% -- and don’t envisage it returning to anywhere near its pre-Covid-19 rate of 3.5% by the end of 2022.
Trump Shout-Out
That dour outlook didn’t stop Trump from telling reporters that the Fed delivered “some good news today” while the president again touted May’s jobs numbers.
Faced with sagging opinion poll ratings, Trump has seized on last week’s report of a fall in joblessness -- from April’s post Great Depression high of 14.7% -- to make his case for re-election in November.
“We’re going to actually be back, higher next year than ever before,” Trump said in triumphant remarks at the White House on June 5, setting aside a week of turmoil over his hostility toward nationwide protests against police brutality following the death of George Floyd. “The only thing that can stop us is bad policy.”
Trump even invoked the memory of Floyd, the black man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police last month, as he touted the U.S. economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
“Hopefully, George is looking down right now and saying there’s a great thing happening for our country,” Trump said in remarks at the White House on Friday. “It’s a great day for him, it’s a great day for everybody.”
That drew an immediate rebuke from former Vice President Joe Biden, the president’s presumed opponent in the November election. Not only did he take Trump to task for his comments on Floyd, Biden criticized the president for crowing about the May jobs number while millions of Americans are still unemployed.
Condemn Racism
In an unusual comment for the apolitical Fed, Powell also alluded to Floyd’s death in his opening statement at the press conference -- to condemn racism in the U.S.
“There is no place at the Federal Reserve for racism, and there should be no place for it in our society,” Powell said. “Everyone deserves the opportunity to participate fully in our society and our economy.”
Prior to the pandemic, Powell had taken particular pride in the success the Fed had achieved pushing down unemployment to a half-century low and in the process spreading the benefits of the recovery to black and other workers who’ve historically been left behind.
That success had come in the face of withering criticism from Trump that the Fed was needlessly holding back the economy by keeping interest rates too high. It was only after the central bank cut rates effectively to zero in March that the president allowed that Powell had finally gotten policy right.
Most Vulnerable
The Fed chairman expressed concern at Wednesday’s press conference about the disproportionate loss of jobs among women, black and Latino workers as a result of the coronavirus, saying that the central bank wants to return these groups to pre-crisis levels of low unemployment.
“Unemployment has gone up more for Hispanics, more for African-Americans, and women have borne an extraordinary and notable share of the burden beyond their percentage in the workforce,” he said. “That’s really, really, really unfortunate.”
Kathleen Bostjancic, an economist at Oxford Economics in New York, said the Fed’s heightened awareness of the advantages to society from a tight jobs market will help convince officials to keep interest rates low even as the economy recovers and unemployment falls.
“The recent protests likely highlight for the Fed the importance of trying to ensure a broader spread of economic gains, which means running the labor market hot,” she said in a note to clients.
Indeed, Powell pledged Wednesday that the Fed would do whatever it takes for as long as it takes to get the jobs market back to full health, even holding out the possibility that it would cap yields on Treasury securities – a strategy it last employed during World War II and its immediate aftermath.
Easy Money
“We’re not even thinking about thinking about raising rates,” he told reporters, after the Fed released forecasts showing that almost all officials expect to keep rates effectively at zero through 2022.
He also suggested that the Fed, Congress and the Trump administration might need to do more to help the economy recover from its steepest downturn in nearly a century.
Speaking on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the U.S. needs additional fiscal stimulus -- particularly for businesses struggling to reopen from coronavirus-related closures -- even as he said the economy has started to recover.
Powell acknowledged that the jobs market may have bottomed out. But he seemed under no illusion that heralded a quick return to the super-healthy labor market that prevailed at the start of the year.
There could be “well into the millions of people who don’t get to go back to their old jobs” or to the industry they used to work in, he said. “It could be some years before we get back to those people finding jobs.”

Investing.com - Stocks on Wall Street have mostly struggled this week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 benchmarks both pulling back after their recent strong gains.
 
In a reality check to the stock market's recent euphoria, the Federal Reserve predicted the U.S. economy would shrink 6.5% in 2020 and unemployment would still be at 9.3% at year's end.
 
The Nasdaq Composite, however, managed to hold on to a good chunk of its rally after registering a closing record high above the 10,000-level for the first time in history on Wednesday.
 


 
Leading up to Thursday’s session, the tech-heavy index has reached new all-time highs each day this week, as investors bet on the sector’s strength amid the economic reopening.
 
The index has now rallied nearly 50% from an intraday low set on March 23, when coronavirus-related lockdowns shocked the stock market.
 


 
The Nasdaq's upbeat performance has come on the back of strong gains in many of the big-name tech-related shares, most notably Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
 
All four companies have seen their shares hit all-time highs this week.
 
The combined market value of the four companies is now more than $5 trillion, with Apple claiming the top spot at nearly $1.53 trillion, followed by Microsoft at $1.49 trillion and Amazon at $1.32 trillion.
 
At $674 billion, Facebook is the only one of the group with a market cap below $1 trillion.
 
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the only one of the five largest tech stocks not to close at an all-time high. It’s still about 5% behind its all-time high of $1,524.87, where it closed on Feb. 19.

1299,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 04:10AM ET</span>","France should speed up return to business activity, says Le Maire","PARIS (Reuters) - France should speed up its gradual return to work and business activity, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday as new data showed the economy lost half a million jobs in the first quarter alone.
President Emmanuel Macron's government put France under one of Europe's most stringent lockdowns from mid-March, and only began lifting restrictions on May 11. Macron is due to address the nation in a televised speech on June 14.
""I want economic activity to resume more quickly,"" Le Maire told LCI television, adding he wanted activity to be back to normal by this summer.
The government expects the euro zone's second-biggest economy to contract by 11% in 2020 and Le Maire told lawmakers on Tuesday that 800,000 jobs were at risk.
Already in the first quarter, more than 500,000 jobs were lost, largely because short-term contracts were not renewed as the economy went into lockdown, data from the INSEE official statistics agency showed on Thursday.
""France is going to get there, it's going to recover and return to growth. We can reduce (unemployment), we can rebound from 2021 if we push up our sleeves, get back to work and step up the recovery,"" Le Maire said.

He added that the car industry, one of the hardest hit, was already returning to normal with strong sales likely in June and July after selling almost no new cars during the lockdown.

""There is no other solution than having a deal by July. If we do not have a stimulus plan, we will have a problem,"" Montchalin told BFM Business radio.
The European Commission's recovery plan aims to help economically weaker countries hit hardest by the coronavirus.
But fiscally conservative northern countries - the ""frugal four"" of the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark and Sweden - have resisted some proposals, notably taking on mutual debt.
Montchalin was also asked to comment on media reports that  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and  Peugeot  (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA (PA:PEUP) faced a lengthy EU antitrust investigation after declining to offer concessions to allay concerns about their planned $50 billion merger.

""All European players know that our fight is employment, how to relaunch production in Europe. I am fully confident that this priority is deeply ingrained everywhere in Europe,"" she said.

1301,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 02:55AM ET</span>",Big rate cut no quick fix for Russian economy,"By Alexander Marrow
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's central bank has signalled it may cut its benchmark rate next week to the lowest since the collapse of the Soviet Union but even that would only have a limited direct impact on the economy's post-pandemic recovery, analysts say. 
With its benchmark rate at 5.5%, the Bank of Russia has far more leeway to cut than counterparts in major Western economies where rates are already close to zero or even negative. 
But analysts doubt whether even a 100 basis point cut would result in a jump in the broad-based borrowing needed to get the economy going, with gross domestic product expected to shrink by up to 6% this year because of the fallout from the coronavirus. 
""There's not much possibility for the population to take on more debt because of the cap on real income growth and there's not much demand from the real economy from businesses,"" said Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at BCS Global Markets.
Governor Elvira Nabiullina has hinted at a 100 basis point cut on June 19, which would be the biggest single reduction since June 2015.
Analysts polled by Reuters forecast a 50 basis point cut, with further easing by the end of the year.
It's a far cry from the Russian crises of 2008/09 and 2014/15 when a toxic combination of economic contraction and booming inflation forced the central bank to push rates sharply higher in a bid to support the rouble. 
This time inflation is just 3% and real disposable incomes are now projected to shrink by 3.8% in 2020, rather than growing by 1.9% as previously expected, according to the economy ministry. 
""The carry-on effect of the rate cut to the economy is likely to be very marginal, very, very small. It won't be a game-changer for the economy at large,"" said Tikhomirov, questioning whether banks would even pass on the cut to customers as their profits had been hit by the pandemic.
BOOST FOR PUTIN PROJECTS? 
The central bank's credibility has grown over the past few years under Nabiullina. A year after she become governor in 2013, the bank went through a torrid time and had to raise its key rate by 650 basis points to 17% in December 2014 to rescue the rouble, just after adopting a free-floating currency regime.
That year, the bank burned through nearly $80 billion to prop up a currency hit by weak oil prices, Western sanctions against Russia over the annexation of Crimea and the impact of companies needing to repay debt denominated in foreign currency.
But interest rates have been on a generally downward trajectory ever since and the central bank cut its key rate by 50 basis points in April to the lowest since the start of 2014.
A 100 basis point cut next week would take it down to 4.5%, which would be lowest since the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991.
Nevertheless, Dmitry Polevoy, chief economist at the Russian Direct Investment Fund, said a move to a policy of bigger cuts would not have an immediate impact as it takes time for changes in monetary policy to filter through to the real economy.
Even cheap loan schemes that have been made available by the government and banks to cushion the fallout from the pandemic have failed to dramatically stimulate spending so far, analysts say. 
A policy shift to bigger rate cuts is also not without risks. It could backfire if inflation starts to accelerate faster than forecast, said Ivan Tchakarov, chief economist at Citi for Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. 
Lower rates could also hit the rouble and lead to more modest returns on governments bonds, or OFZs, which have been snapped up by foreign investors but are already becoming less attractive because of recent rate cuts.
One significant benefit of a cut, however, would be to make cheaper money available to the state as it emerges from its lockdown and President Vladimir Putin pushes ahead with $400 billion of economic and social spending on national projects. 

""It is money, it is blood for the economy,"" Yury Borisov, a deputy prime minister, said last month of the expected rate cut.

1302,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 02:25AM ET</span>",Wild guesses as UK economists grapple with looming GDP plunge,"By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - For once, economists are united on one thing: official data on Friday will show that Britain's economy suffered a record collapse during April's coronavirus lockdown.
The question is, how big was the hit?
There was an unprecedented range of views in the latest Reuters poll of more than two dozen economists, with the median forecast for an 18.4% month-on-month plunge in gross domestic product in April.
That was when much of the economy was subject to tight restrictions and it is expected to be the low point of the slump as the lockdown is gradually lifted. 
The least pessimistic saw an 8.5% drop, which would still be worse than anything during the 2008-09 global financial crisis. 
The gloomiest forecaster in the poll - Investec chief economist Philip Shaw - predicted a 31.5% plunge.
""I do feel a bit like Doctor Doom,"" he said.
As a starting point he used scenarios published by the Bank of England and the government's fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility.
However both institutions have warned that those scenarios are far more uncertain than their usual forecasts in which changes of just a few decimal places can be the subject of intense debate.
Economists concede there is limited value in producing precise forecasts for such a severe collapse in demand, especially during times of such historic volatility.
RACKING MY BRAINS 
Investors were shocked last week when data showed the United States added 2.5 million jobs in May after the consensus pointed to a drop of 8 million.
Still, analyst predictions represent some form of touchstone for the data when it arrives.
""I've been racking my brains to figure out what's happened in the past, if there's anything out there that would help me to understand what's going on now,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Peter Dixon.
""And the answer is, I don't think there is. We're in genuinely uncharted territory."" 
Dixon expects a roughly 18% drop in output in April.
To come up with forecasts, Shaw and Dixon ditched some of the usual economic indicators like purchasing managers' indexes (PMIs), because they are not designed to measure the huge falls in demand caused by the shutdown.
Instead, they have turned to other measures like electricity demand and data measuring the movement of people.
Shaw said his electricity demand model chimed with his interpretation of signals from the labour market.
HSBC economist Liz Martins said coming up with a forecast for Friday's numbers had been a nightmare.
""But it's not the interesting part because it's like comparing a shop's sales when it's shut to when it's open,"" she said. ""The interesting part will be where demand lands when we come back from lockdown.""
Few right now can predict that with any confidence, even at institutions with the biggest research teams.
""We don't know how much scarring there will be,"" BoE Governor Andrew Bailey told a panel discussion hosted by the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.

""I think it is reasonable to say there will be some, but it is very hard to judge,"" he said.

1303,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 12:50AM ET</span>","Pioneer of yield target, Japan drifts back to money printing to battle pandemic","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - As central banks dive into the uncharted waters of yield curve control, Japan, the pioneer of the unorthodox policy, is struggling to stay focused on its own yield targets as it looks instead to money printing to help firms hit by the coronavirus.
The Bank of Japan is expected to hold off expanding stimulus at its policy meeting next week and make no major changes to a set of tools rolled out in recent months to cushion the economic blow from the health crisis.
But BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is likely to stress the bank's resolve to keep flooding markets with cash to help companies stay afloat and forgo job cuts.
""The BOJ's near-term focus will remain on keeping markets stable and easing corporate funding strains,"" said a source familiar with its thinking, a view echoed by two more sources.
""Interest rate cuts remain in the BOJ's tool-kit. But it's probably not the most likely option now,"" the source said.
While warning of risks over the outlook, the BOJ is likely to maintain its view the economy will gradually recover from the damage wrought by the pandemic.
The BOJ became the first central bank to introduce yield curve control (YCC) in 2016, pledging to guide short-term rates at -0.1% and long-term borrowing costs around zero.
Back then, the policy was seen by other central banks as a sign of Japan's desperation to revive growth through extreme measures.
Now, yield targeting has adopted broader appeal as the pandemic forced many central banks globally to cut rates to near zero.
Australia now sets a target for three-yield bond yields and some Federal Reserve officials have cited YCC as a potential tool including Chairman Jerome Powell.
In Japan, YCC helps keep borrowing costs low for the government as it lays out two stimulus packages worth a combined $2.2 trillion to battle the crisis.
And yet, the BOJ's near-term focus is shifting towards the amount of money it pumps out via several crisis-response tools, including a 75-trillion-yen ($701 billion) lending facility aimed at channeling funds to companies hit by the virus fallout.
That stimulus mix creates challenges for the BOJ in the way it communicates and guides market expectations.
Putting a new emphasis on the amount of money the BOJ prints makes it difficult to later scale back the programme, with markets potentially interpreting such a move as a policy tightening.
It also makes it harder to convince markets that the BOJ still considers interest rates its main policy lever.
Due to the way it is designed, the size of Japan's lending scheme could exceed 100 trillion yen if more loans are taken out via government programmes, the sources say.
""When there's so much uncertainty on when the pandemic could be contained, policymakers must prevent companies from running out of cash. The BOJ is doing exactly that,"" said Yasuhide Yajima, chief economist at NLI Research Institute.
""The next task is to restore confidence among firms and households, so they start spending and stimulate growth. I'm not sure whether the BOJ has any tools left to do this.""

Purchases on credit and debit cards at retail outlets rose 78.9% from April, Statistics New Zealand said Thursday in Wellington. That follows a 47.5% drop in April and a 3.2% decline in March. However, the value of spending at NZ$5.3 billion ($3.5 billion) is 9% lower than in February.
The coronavirus lockdown was lifted on May 14, breathing life into retailing outlets that -- other than supermarkets and a handful of other essential stores -- had been shuttered for seven weeks. As the nation grapples with rising unemployment and a lack of international tourism, the prospects for a sustained surge in consumer spending appear dim.
“There are signs of pent up demand after the lockdown,” said Satish Ranchhod, senior economist at  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp in Auckland. “We expect to see further gains in spending over the coming months however we don’t expect a return to pre-Covid-19 levels for some time. Job losses, increases in debt and general nervousness about the economic outlook will dampen spending appetites.”
Much of May’s spending increase was seen in hospitality, which reported adjusted sales of NZ$640 million, up from NZ$57 million in April. Still, that spend is 41% smaller than the NZ$1.1 billion seen in February.

1305,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 06:45PM ET</span>","Fed's Powell puts spotlight on unequal U.S. economy, citing 'pain of racial injustice'","By Ann Saphir and Jonnelle Marte
SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said the coronavirus crisis is worsening racial inequality and delivered a passionate pledge to reverse the massive U.S. job losses that have fallen most heavily on blacks and other minorities.
Race, gender, and the economically corrosive effects of inequality have become more frequent topics for Fed speeches and research in recent years, but Powell's remarks were unusually pointed.
The ""biggest thing"" the Fed can do to combat high black unemployment and other economic inequities, he said, is to use its tools to push down unemployment.
""The economy can have very low unemployment, very low unemployment"" without sparking inflation or financial imbalances, Powell said in a news conference following a policy-setting meeting where the central bank signaled it would keep interest rates near zero for years to come.
""We can use our tools to support the labor market and support the economy. We can use them until we do fully recover,"" he said.
Powell spoke a day after the funeral of George Floyd, a black man whose killing on May 25 during an arrest by police in Minneapolis touched off weeks of mass protests worldwide against racism and inequality.
""I want to acknowledge the tragic events that have again put a spotlight on the pain of racial injustice in this country,"" Powell said, adding that there is ""no place"" for racism in the United States. ""Everyone deserves the opportunity to participate fully in our society and in our economy.""
The civil unrest has taken place against the backdrop of a sharp recession that crushed hard-won labor market gains among African Americans, Hispanics and women during the record-long U.S. expansion that ended in February.
Those job losses are ""really, really, really unfortunate"" because just a few months back ""we had effectively the first tight labor market in a quarter century,"" Powell said. ""The downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans.""
And while the Fed cannot target a recovery for specific groups, he said policymakers are ""cognizant of the fact"" that workers on lower end of the wage spectrum did not feel the benefits of the recovery until the final years of the expansion.
Black unemployment, historically about double white unemployment, fell as low as 5.8% before the crisis hit. Then authorities began imposing shutdowns to slow the spread of infection, and unemployment exploded across the board. But black workers faced steeper losses: in May, black unemployment rose to 16.8%, while white unemployment fell to 12.4%.

Some 3.2 million fewer blacks are employed now than were before the crisis, the data show.

1306,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 05:40PM ET</span>","Better three months late than never for Fed 'Main Street' loans, Powell says","By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - It is not too late for small and medium-sized U.S. businesses to benefit from the Federal Reserve's ""Main Street"" lending program, Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday, even though its launch in the coming days will be nearly three months after the central bank announced the nearly $600 billion program.
Planned as the Fed's first foray since the Great Depression into providing credit to the ""real economy"" rather than just the financial sector, it has yet to extend a dollar in loans, and the worst of the crisis spawned by the coronavirus pandemic may have already passed.
""Is it too late? No,"" Powell said during his press conference following the Fed's latest two-day policy meeting. ""We have significant interest we think.""
Powell also said the program will be left open for new loans as long as needed.
The program has presented the stiffest challenge to the Fed of all the emergency relief measures it has introduced since the COVID-19 outbreak threw the U.S. economy into free fall.
Complaints from lobbyists, bankers and small business advocates that the original parameters were too inflexible and the loan sizes too big has already prompted the Fed to retool the program significantly twice.
Powell on Wednesday repeated that the Fed will make more changes if needed to see that the Main Street program is effective in funneling capital to businesses that would generally be too big to qualify for other programs such as the Small Business Administration's Payroll Protection Program or too small to tap public arenas like the bond market.
Earlier this week it cut the minimum loan size in half to $250,000 and offered borrowers an extra year to repay, bringing the loan term to five years.

1307,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 05:30PM ET</span>",Possible Fed move to cap yield rise could further weaken U.S. dollar,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar would probably come under further pressure if the Federal Reserve adopts targets for U.S. Treasury yields that would limit their rise and ensure that interest rates remain near zero for some time.
Capping bond yields could diminish the attractiveness of U.S. Treasury debt, as investors look to other alternatives, analysts said. That may exacerbate a downtrend in the U.S. currency that has been partly triggered by a gradual reopening of global economies following shutdowns aimed at curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Since late May, the dollar has fallen about 4.2% against a basket of major currencies.
The Federal Reserve did not announce any measures to cap the rise of bond yields on Wednesday at the end of its two-day meeting. But in a press briefing, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank would consider yield curve controls once it gets a better understanding of where the economy is headed. 
New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) and Fed Governor Lael Brainard had raised the idea earlier as a possible complement to other monetary policy actions aimed at keeping rates and borrowing costs ultra-low to spur spending and buoy the economy.
Such a move is seen as a potential policy tool at the central bank's disposal and could come about later in the year.
Instead of simply setting short-term rates, the Fed could set specific target rates anywhere from bills to notes and bonds. 
This has been done in Japan and Australia, and once before in the United States when the Fed and the Treasury agreed to cap borrowing costs to finance spending during World War II. 
Analysts said that if the Fed does decide to adopt this policy, it will likely cap Treasury yields out to three or even five years, a move that could undermine the dollar.
""If you put yield curve control, it is usually bad for the currency because yields are very low, so there is no incentive to buy the bonds,"" said Momtchil Pojarliev, head of currencies at BNP Asset Management in New York. 
Boris Schlossberg, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York, said a Fed announcement on yield curve control could push the euro higher against the dollar to the $1.14-$1.15 level from $1.1368 currently.
After trading in narrow ranges for several weeks, Treasury yields surged last week, as the benchmark U.S. 10-year yield approached 1.0%, amid better-than-expected U.S. economic data. 
BNP's Pojarliev said, however, he does not expect the Fed to take such steps, but if it does and it weakens the dollar even more, it would be an opportunity to go long on the currency because of how oversold the greenback has become.
Some analysts said given the ferocious rally in bond yields last week, investors may have already begun to price in this monetary policy measure. U.S. 10-year yields slid below 0.90% this week and the dollar sold off against the yen.
Analysts said Japanese investors have also started selling the dollar ahead of the Fed's policy decision.
""I think investors have been selling the dollar because they think the Fed will be aggressive with yield curve control,"" said John Floyd, principal portfolio manager for the dynamic macro currency strategy at Record Currency Management in New York. 
Adrian Helfert, director of multi-asset portfolios at wealth manager Westwood in Dallas expects the dollar's weakness to be more pronounced if the Fed makes some form of yield curve announcement.
""Take the euro zone for instance, where we're seeing a shift to fiscal stimulus. Big fiscal stimulus has a different effect than monetary policy in pushing down or lifting the relevant currency,"" he said.

""The more we bring in monetary policy relative to our partners like what the Fed is doing, the more the dollar is going to depreciate against those partners.""

(Reuters) - More than 20 British business groups have asked the government to relax its coronavirus quarantine rules and restrictions and start opening up the economy to trade partners.
The groups, including the British Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of Small Businesses, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and London First, wrote a joint letter to interior minister Priti Patel, foreign minister Dominic Raab and transport minister Grant Shapps.
""As we look to recover from the economic shock that COVID-19 has delivered, it will be vital that we start to open the UK up to our trading partners"", said the letter shared with Reuters on Wednesday by two of the groups.
The letter urged the government to come up with a plan that includes a framework ""for establishing travel corridors between the UK and low-risk countries to enable exemptions from the blanket quarantine requirements for UK arrivals"". 
""A clear set of risk-based criteria should be set out so that businesses can start to plan for a controlled re-opening"", the letter said.
It also asked for a timeline for returning to ""risk-based travel advice"" from Britain's Foreign Office, adding that ""indefinite and indiscriminate"" advice not to travel overseas prevents businesses from being able to make their plans.
Britain, with the fourth-most coronavirus infections in the world at more than 290,000 and 41,000 people dead, introduced a 14-day quarantine period for almost everyone entering the country from June 8.
However, government ministers have said they are looking at whether travel corridors could allow Britons to go on holiday https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-tourism-britain/european-tourist-hotspots-hope-to-lure-britons-despite-quarantine-idUKKBN23H2MM in destinations with a low coronavirus infection rate.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday signaled it would provide years of extraordinary support for an economy facing a torturous slog back from the coronavirus pandemic, with policymakers projecting a 6.5% decline in gross domestic product this year and a 9.3% unemployment rate at year's end.
In the first economic projections of the pandemic era, U.S. central bank policymakers put into numbers what has been an emerging narrative: that the measures put in place to battle a health crisis will echo through the economy for years to come rather than be quickly reversed as commerce reopens.
The projections show the unemployment rate falling to 6.5% at the end of 2021 and 5.5% at the end of 2022 - a full 2 percentage points above where it was at the end of last year, representing millions of lost years of work. 
""The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment and inflation in the near term and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term,"" the Fed said in a policy statement after a two-day meeting.
The response: officials see the key overnight interest rate, or federal funds rate, remaining near zero through at least 2022. The decision to leave that rate unchanged on Wednesday was unanimous. 
Officials also promised to maintain the Fed's bond purchases at least at the current pace of around $80 billion per month in Treasuries and $40 billion per month in agency and mortgage-backed securities - a sign the central bank is beginning to shape its long-run strategy for the economic recovery.
In remarks that acknowledged the nationwide protests against racial inequality that erupted in recent weeks, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was committed to trying to restore jobs and growth to where they were.
""The work of the Fed touches communities and families and businesses across the country ... We are committed to using our full range of tools ... to ensure the recovery will be as robust as possible,"" Powell said in a news briefing via a video link. ""It is a long road. It is going to take some time."" 
That rebound is expected to begin in earnest in 2021, with economic growth forecast at 5%.
On a positive note, the Fed did not mark down its long-run estimates of full employment, trend growth and the federal funds rate, a sign officials feel the country may escape permanent damage. 
""Their messaging is we are keeping rates low, but this is going to work, it is going to get us there,"" said Bruce Monrad, chairman and portfolio manager at Northeast Investors Trust in Boston.
On Wall Street, which had been near unchanged ahead of the Fed's statement, stock prices were mixed in choppy trading. The benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX) was down 0.4% whereas the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5% at a record high. Treasury security yields slipped and the dollar fell against the euro (EUR=) and yen .
YEARS-LONG FIGHT
The pledge to keep monetary policy loose until the U.S. economy is back on track repeats a promise made early in the central bank's response to the coronavirus pandemic.
That response included cutting interest rates to near zero in March and making trillions of dollars in credit available to banks, financial firms, and a wide array of companies.
But the projections are the first issued since December, and offer policymakers' views on how fast employment and economic growth might recover, and an initial steer on how long interest rates will be pinned down. 
Through most of last year U.S. central bankers felt they were in an enviable spot, with record low unemployment, tame inflation, and a strong expectation that both would continue.

But the pandemic, which has killed more than 112,000 Americans, has now thrown them into what may be a years-long fight to bring Americans back to work after some 20 million jobs were lost from March through May.

1311,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>",Column: Central banks can't back off now - Mike Dolan,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - Having inflated balance sheets once again to keep a lid on long-term borrowing costs during the pandemic, central banks now face a conundrum over how to keep the steep rise in government and company debt affordable as markets anticipate the recovery.
How they manage this next stage of the crisis will define the future relationship between operationally independent central banks and governments -- a line often blurred over the past decade but which many feel could now dissolve completely.
A slight backup in Treasury yields over the past week puts Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting in sharp focus, adding pressure on the U.S. central bank to challenge the move in some way, either with guidance or action.
Many central banks have already taken policy rates to zero or negative and seem reluctant to move further, leaving the emphasis on buying ever more bonds to keep long-term debt costs down, known as 'yield curve control'.
And for many, the die is already cast.
""We are in a 'soft' Modern Monetary Theory-inspired policy regime,"" said Pictet Wealth Management economist Thomas Costerg, referring to the much-debated view that central banks can and should support government investment spending by capping interest rates in the absence of inflation.
""Hyperinflation will only be a risk if the Fed moves to 'pure' MMT -- which would include the Fed being placed under the White House's direct control -- but we see this as unlikely.""
Markets are assuming the G4 central banks from the United States, euro zone, Japan and Britain will expand their balance sheets by more than $12 trillion, or about 30% of collective gross domestic product, by the end of next year.
Yet just a whiff of recovery, strengthened by signs of a turn in the U.S. jobs market last month, saw 10-year Treasury yields add 30 basis points in a week, to as high as 0.95% before steadying. Market optimism also caused the yield gap between two-year and 10-year Treasuries to jump 20 basis points.
(GRAPHIC: Central banks face big test - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmyvmoymmvr/cenbanks.PNG)
STOCKS NOW RELY ON NEW REGIME
Many economies have yet to recover even 50% of pre-pandemic activity. But most major stock markets have already regained more than 80% of losses incurred as the coronavirus shock unfolded in February.
That bet hinges on a quick return to growth as lockdowns ease. But it also assumes benchmark interest rates have taken another leg lower in their 30-year downtrend and aren't coming up again soon if the mountains of government debt incurred to fight the virus are to be serviced easily over time.
Thanks largely to the Fed, the average interest rate on all interest-bearing U.S. Treasury debt dropped 44 basis points between January and May -- about 2 percentage points below where it was at the depth of the 2008 crash. That is despite U.S. net debt as a share of GDP vaulting more than 30 points to above 100% over the decade.
And despite a brief jolt in March before the Fed stepped in, the drop in dollar borrowing costs for double-A credit-rated companies has been even steeper -- 80 basis points since January and 6 full percentage points in 10 years.
The drop in ""risk-free"" rates and corporate bond yields over the past decade -- and again this year -- has been a powerful driver of equity valuation models working off discount rates to calculate net present value.
But allowing benchmark bond markets to rebalance naturally as the recovery takes hold could jeopardise the rebound itself, by retightening financial conditions and reversing stock markets' optimistic return to square one.
Economists at Oxford Economics said on Tuesday that risk assets are not ready for a ""discount rate shock"".
""A sharp move higher in real yields in a tantrum-style sell-off will be particularly bad for the growth-stocks heavy US market,"" they wrote, referring to the ""taper tantrum"" that pushed up yields as the Fed slowed asset purchases in 2013.
But even if the Fed doesn't announce formal yield curve targets later on Wednesday, many investors now assume it will eventually have to do so or reap another whirlwind.
""The uncharted territory that policymakers have entered makes policy execution particularly important,"" asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) told clients this week. A key aspect of this policy revolution, it added, is ""the explicit blurring of fiscal and monetary policies, including central banks absorbing new government debt to maintain low bond yields.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday that the U.S. economy has already begun to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic and would ""improve dramatically"" in the third and fourth quarters.
Mnuchin, who appears before the U.S. Senate Small Business Committee to review the progress of federal coronavirus rescue loan programs, said in written testimony that incoming jobs and other economic data ""show that we are well positioned for a strong, phased reopening of our country.""Mnuchin and Jovita Carranza, Administrator of the Small Business Administration, are expected to face tough questions over initial glitches in launching the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program to provide forgivable loans aimed at keeping employees of small businesses on payroll for eight weeks during the lockdown.
Many small businesses had difficulties getting loans due to technical glitches, while some well-financed publicly traded companies accessed multi-million dollar loans, prompting Mnuchin to issue new guidance requiring the companies to return the funds.
""As you might expect with a program of this magnitude executed on a national scale in record time, we initially experienced some complications. We resolved them quickly,"" Mnuchin said in his testimony.
He said that the program was supporting employment of about 50 million workers and more than 75 percent of the small business payroll in all 50 states.
Despite the Treasury chief's optimism over the economy, it has a long road back. While May jobs data unexpectedly improved, unemployment remains at 13.3%, a post-World War Two high, with the jobless rate still rising for blacks and Asians and recovery to prior levels expected to take years.

The World Bank said on Monday that the U.S. economy will still shrink by 6.1% this year, with further downward revisions likely for its global forecast of a 5.2% contraction.

LONDON (Reuters) - Big banks are on track to ditch the Libor interest rate by the end of 2021 despite the coronavirus pandemic, though their European and U.S. clients are dragging their feet, a study showed on Wednesday.
Regulators want the London Interbank Offered Rate or Libor scrapped after banks were fined billions of dollars for trying to manipulate a rate still used to price contracts worth about $400 trillion globally.
The transition to rates set by the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve is one of the biggest tasks faced by markets in decades.
Market disruption from the pandemic has raised questions about the end 2021 deadline, but regulators have reaffirmed it in recent weeks even though some of milestones have been pushed back.
""While challenging, most of the respondents said they were on pace in terms of operational and technological readiness; a few smaller firms saw the transition timeline as too aggressive to meet,"" the report from Sia Partners consultancy said.
It spoke with more than 70 market participants between April and June, including U.S. and foreign banks, asset managers, insurers, to check if the pandemic has derailed efforts to end the use of Libor.
A small minority of the firms expected a delay in the cessation, while less than a quarter wanted a delay.
There was also a ""sustained lack of either motivation or resource commitment by a myriad of client types to invest in their transition process"".
Most firms said legislation would keep transition on track by mandating which alternative rate must be used in a contract after Libor ends, the report said.
U.S. industry groups are trying to persuade New York State lawmakers to approve such a law, while in Britain regulators are resistant.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain is seeking a trading relationship with the European Union that is too close to that of an EU member, the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Wednesday, urging London to adjust its demands in the four months left to reach a deal. 
Britain left the EU, the world's largest trading bloc, on Jan. 31 after 47 years of partnership to the huge regret of EU leaders who now insist that London accept the economic consequences of looser ties. 
""The truth is that in many areas (Britain) is demanding a lot more than Canada, Japan or many of our other (trade) partners,"" Barnier told a forum in Brussels, referring to sophisticated trade deals that Britain would like to emulate. 
""In many areas it is looking to maintain the benefits of being a member state without the constraints,"" Barnier said. ""It is looking to pick and choose the most attractive elements of the (EU) single market without the obligations.""
Last week, a British official said it was ""obvious"" the EU had to show more flexibility, after talks made no progress.
The European Parliament, which must approve any final accord, will debate in two committees on Friday its position on what a future relationship should entail.
According to a public draft report seen by Reuters, the parliament is set to say that ""this cherry-picking approach is a no-go for the EU ... the EU will not agree to a deal at any cost"".
Under the terms of Britain's exit from the EU, both sides need to reach a deal by the end of October.
Top British officials are expected to meet Barnier on Friday before British Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets Barnier's boss, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and the chairman of the 27 EU leaders, Charles Michel, later this month.
Barnier said Britain wanted quota- and tariff-free access to the EU while diverging from rules that govern the bloc.

LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said he could see some early signs of an economic recovery in Britain as the government's coronavirus lockdown restrictions are lifted, but warned there was still likely to be long-term damage.
""If there is any such thing as a normal recession ... this one will be different. There will be elements of a faster recovery, because the first stage of the recovery is literally lifting restrictions and allowing people to go out,"" he said. 
""And we see ... evidence of elements of that recovery starting,"" he added at a panel discussion hosted by the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.
He did not give details of that evidence, but surveys of businesses and consumers in May and early June have pointed to some recovery as the lockdown lifts. 
Bailey said the BoE expected the recovery to take longer than the simple lifting of restriction would suggest, however, as consumers were likely to be cautious about returning to restaurants and similar venues.
Long-term damage was also likely, as some businesses would not survive the coronavirus shutdown, even with government help, while others might find their business models - such as high-street stores or packed bars - no longer appealed to the public.
""We don't know how much scarring there will be. I think it is reasonable to say there will be some but it is very hard to judge,"" he said.
Britain will publish on Friday its first official data for economic output in April, which economists polled by Reuters expect to be down by more than a fifth compared with April 2019.
Last month the BoE set out a scenario that showed economic output returning to its pre-crisis level in the second half of next year.
Bailey did not discuss monetary policy ahead of a BoE decision next week, when many economists expect it to add to the 200 billion pounds ($255 billion) of extra asset purchases it announced in March.

But he noted that the coronavirus pandemic gave more urgency to concerns the BoE had before the crisis that some businesses and non-bank financial institutions were ill-prepared for economic shocks.

1319,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>","Has inflation, Brazil's eternal bogeyman, finally been slain?","By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Inflation in Brazil is on course to fall to an all-time low this year as Latin America's largest economy sinks, giving the central bank leeway to keep interest rates lower for longer or reduce them closer to zero.
The crisis unleashed by COVID-19 will likely cause the biggest fall in gross domestic product since records began in 1900. With unemployment set to hit its highest rate in decades, demand is expected to tumble, exerting a strong downward force on inflation.
Figures on Wednesday showed Brazil in May registered the second steepest monthly rate of deflation since records began in 1980, and the lowest annual inflation, 1.9%, since 1999.
A move below 1.65% in the coming months, an uncontroversial hypothesis given the output gap and level of slack in the economy, would mark a new all-time low.
For a country that only a generation ago had hyperinflation of almost 7,000%, it is remarkable. 
""Inflation is pretty much dead. The output gap is huge and high unemployment shows there is considerable slack, so it is hard to see the economy overheating any time soon,"" said Marcelo Carvalho, head of emerging market research at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) in London. 
""So the conditions are there to cut rates more,"" he said.
(GRAPHIC: Brazil infllation - monthly: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdvxdwkevx/INFLATIONMM.png) 
The central bank's benchmark Selic rate is currently a record low 3%, and widely expected to be reduced to 2.25% next week, a level policymakers indicated last month would be its floor.
Economists at JP Morgan last week changed their forecast for action by the central bank's rate-setting committee known as ""Copom."" In addition to the 75 basis points penciled in for next week, they now expect another 50 basis-point cut in August, which would take the Selic down to 1.75%. 
For Brazil, that is closer to zero than most would have dared contemplate even a year ago. In real terms, factoring in inflation, it essentially would be zero.
""We expect policy to be re-calibrated to weaker growth, deeper disinflation, a stronger current account balance, and calmer global financial conditions,"" JP Morgan's Cassiana Fernandez and Vinicius Moreira wrote in a note last week.
Their estimates of the ""Taylor Rule,"" an economic model which uses growth and inflation to predict where interest rates should be, suggests rates could be cut below 1.75%, were it not for financial stability concerns that would raise.
RATE CUT DOOR OPEN
Not only is inflation significantly undershooting the central bank's target this year of 4.00%, expectations for next year remain well anchored too. According to the central bank's latest weekly ""FOCUS"" survey of economists, inflation next year will be 3.1%, well below the official goal of 3.75%.
(GRAPHIC: Brazil inflation - annual: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovakzdzva/INFLATIONYY.png)
Part of the reason inflation expectations remain anchored is because of the credibility the central bank has built up in recent years with investors, business and the population at large.
Inflation has also been falling globally for years, with Japan and some other developed economies battling deflation. Yet two countries on Brazil's vast border, Argentina and Venezuela, are proof that inflation can still flourish.
More immediately though, the Brazilian real's 20% recovery since hitting a record low near 6.00 per dollar a month ago, the global market rebound, and Brazil's swing to a record current account surplus in April also all buy the central bank time.
The exchange rate appreciation, in particular, alleviates any inflationary pressure that may have built up from its plunge earlier in the year, and cools financial stability concerns. Both could potentially tilt Copom to a more dovish stance.
Especially with inflation so weak to begin with.
""The real's bounce will allow Copom to leave the door open a bit longer,"" said Mauricio Une, chief Brazil economist at Rabobank in Sao Paulo. 
He recently cut his 2020 GDP forecast to minus 7% from minus 4%, lowered his inflation forecast to 1.3% from 2.3%, and said unemployment could nudge 17% in the coming months. 
Central bank President Roberto Campos Neto has expressed reluctance to follow many industrial countries in reducing borrowing costs to near zero, or in economist jargon, the effective lower bound. 
Emerging market central banks have not built up the same level of investor trust in their institutions, faith in their currencies, or policy credibility over the decades like the U.S. Federal Reserve or Bank of England. 
Campos Neto and his colleagues on Copom say nobody is quite sure where the lower bound is. Monetary policy director Fabio Kanczuk said last week the Selic was still ""far from the effective lower bound"" and that the 2.25% level was not ""written in stone.""

Despite the upward pressure on longer-term rates from Brazil's precarious fiscal position, with government debt at a record high and heading above 90% of GDP, sinking inflation and a deep recession may see policymakers err on the dovish rather than hawkish side.

Asked if the Friday deadline could be extended again he said it would be and pointed out that a previous restructuring negotiation in 2005 had taken the best part of a year.
""Yes (it could be extended), 10 days or more. I don't know. We are in a negotiation,"" he said.
Argentina and its foreign bondholders have been edging closer to an deal to restructure the sovereign debt, which has become unsustainable after two straight years of recession, rising borrowing costs and a tumbling peso currency.
The gap between what Argentina is willing to pay and what bondholders are demanding has narrowed over recent months, helping propel the country's bonds, which tumbled into distressed territory last year amid fears over the economy.
Reaching a deal is critical to avoid a messy legal standoff that could lock Argentina out of international markets for years after it defaulted for a ninth time in May when it missed a deadline for interest payments on three bonds.

Argentina is also in talks with the International Monetary Fund, a major creditor to the grains producer, to revamp a $57 billion credit facility struck in 2018 under the previous government of Mauricio Macri.

1321,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>","ECB doesn't need to expand shopping list yet, Schnabel says","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel played down an imminent expansion of the ECB's crisis-fighting tools on Wednesday, pouring cold water on the notion of buying bonds issued by banks or by junk-rated companies.
The ECB boosted its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme to 1.35 trillion euros ($1.54 trillion) last week and investors have been speculating over whether it will add new assets to its shopping list, which is mostly comprised of government and corporate bonds.
Schnabel said the central bank was open to that prospect if needed but the time hadn't come yet.
""We don't necessarily have to extend our toolbox already right now, but according to how the crisis develops there may be a time when this becomes necessary,"" Schnabel said during an online panel discussion.
ECB staff have been working on the possibility of including bonds issued by companies that have been downgraded to junk during the coronavirus outbreak, such as German airline Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and French car-maker  Renault  (PA:RENA).
While the Federal Reserve is already doing so, Schnabel noted the Fed could count on the U.S. Treasury to bear the first losses on such bonds, something that may be difficult to replicate in the euro zone. 
Asked by UniCredit's (MI:CRDI) chief executive Jean-Pierre Mustier whether the ECB could buy bank bonds, Schnabel said this may raise a conflict of interest because of the central bank's role as the sector's supervisor.
The ECB scooped up all of Italy's new debt in April and May, setting aside its prescribed national quotas to cap borrowing costs for the indebted, virus-stricken country.
It also bought 35 billion euros of commercial paper to help euro zone companies navigate a liquidity squeeze.
Schnabel said the ECB would continue focusing its bond purchases on the countries and markets where they are most needed for the whole duration of the PEPP. 

Estonian central bank governor Madis Muller said earlier the ECB should limit how much its bond purchases deviate from each country's shareholding in the bank, while Slovakia's Peter Kazimir wished they could end ""as soon as possible"".

1322,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 09:40AM ET</span>","Thailand should join Asia-Pacific trade pact talks, business leaders say","BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand should take part in Asia-Pacific trade agreement talks in August to help to decide whether to join the pact, a group of leading Thai business associations said on Wednesday.
The country has said previously it could seek membership of the Comprehensive and Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), as competition intensifies in electronics and agriculture from rivals such as Vietnam and Malaysia.
Opposition parties and some civil society groups oppose membership of the trade agreement, saying it could harm the farm and healthcare sectors.
But joining the talks will help the country learn more about the pact so it can adjust to competition, Predee Daochai, chairman of a joint standing committee on commerce, industry and banking, told a briefing.
""The process of seeking membership will take at least four years and Thailand can withdraw at any stage if found unbeneficial,"" he said.
Member countries, including Japan and Canada, signed the CPTPP deal in 2018 without the United States. The original 12-member agreement, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), was thrown into limbo in early 2017 when President Donald Trump withdrew from it. 
Thailand's commerce ministry has said membership would boost the country's economy, helping to offset the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. 
Members of parliament are planning to form a committee to study the impact of the trade pact as they debated the issue at Wednesday's parliamentary session.
""Does the CPTPP answer the goals for the development of the country?,"" said Jiraporn Sinthuprai of the opposition Pheu Thai Party. ""This study has to be done to maintain national interests that benefit a majority of Thais"". 

Some members said Thailand did not need to rush to join the pact. Membership will need parliamentary approval.

Analysts expect inflation to reach 2.8% at the end of this year, in line with the central bank's latest forecast. The bank targets inflation at 1.5%-3.5%.
Four of seven analysts expect the central bank to hold its benchmark interest rate at 1.75% at its next meeting, most likely in July. The bank has not had a fixed meetings calendar from the onset of the coronavirus epidemic.

The government had put the cost at 110 billion euros in April but has since had to make upward revisions to take account of falling tax revenue and extra spending, it said in its budget update.
Combined with various financing guarantees the state has extended to companies and EU institutions, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the government was mobilising a total 460 billion euros, or 20% of GDP.
""This response is perfectly comparable with what other countries are doing, including Germany,"" Le Maire told lawmakers on the lower house of parliament's finance committee.
President Emmanuel Macron's government now expects the euro zone's second-biggest economy to contract 11% this year, which France's independent fiscal watchdog described on Wednesday as ""cautious"" despite being the worst slump since at least World War Two.
The government put France under one of Europe's most stringent lockdowns from mid-March, shutting down vast swathes of the economy, and only began lifting restrictions on May 11. 
Companies have put more than 13 million workers on state-subsidised furloughs at a cost the government put at 31 billion euros in the revised budget, shouldered two-thirds by the state and the rest by unemployment insurance.
The government has also deferred billions of euros in tax and payroll charges and mobilised 40 billion euros in state aid, tax breaks, loans and guarantees for the tourism, automobile, tech and aerospace sectors.

With tax revenue falling fast, the government now expects an unprecedented public sector budget deficit of 11.4% of economic output this year, revised up last week from 9.1% in April.

India's long-term rating was affirmed at 'BBB-' with a stable outlook while the short-term rating was held at 'A-3'.
Earlier this month, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) downgraded India to a notch above junk, falling in line with other global agencies, but also cut its outlook to 'negative' on the back of rising debt and persistent stress in the financial system.
S&P's stable outlook reflects its expectation that the Indian economy will recover following the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic, and maintain its sound net external position, it said.
The agency also assumes that the government's fiscal deficit will recede markedly following a multi-year high this fiscal year.
""While risks to India's long-term growth rate are rising, ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the country's growth rate ahead of peers,"" analysts at the firm wrote.
S&P expects the government's fiscal deficit to touch 11% of GDP in the current year to March 2021 on the back of pandemic related spending and said the government's ability to consolidate its finances once the economy begins to recover will be key in determining the sustainability of India's debt stock.
India's ratings could be raised if the government significantly curtails its fiscal deficits, resulting in materially lower net indebtedness at the general government level, S&P said.
Downside pressure on ratings would emerge from failure of GDP growth recovering meaningfully from 2021 onwards and also net government deficit levels sharply exceeding forecasts, it added.
""India's overall external position remains a credit strength, largely owing to the economy's limited external indebtedness,"" the analysts wrote.
""We expect India's current account deficit to decline modestly this year, and to continue to improve over the forecast period, largely owing to its improving terms of trade on weaker oil prices"".

1327,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Germany eyes up to 50 billion euros of additional debt for stimulus push - source,"By Michael Nienaber and Holger Hansen
BERLIN (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz is considering borrowing up to another 50 billion euros ($56.8 billion) to finance Berlin's bumper stimulus package, a senior official with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.
The plan to take on more debt underlines Germany's massive fiscal shift from Europe's former austerity champion to one of the biggest spenders in the euro zone's efforts to counter the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet is planning to pass a second supplementary budget on June 17 to finance its 130-billion-euro stimulus package to support Europe's largest economy, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Another official with knowledge of the budget plans also said the cabinet wanted to pass the extra budget next Wednesday, adding the finance ministry was looking at issuing more debt than the originally envisaged 25-30 billion euros.
Both sources said the finance ministry wanted a bigger financial buffer so it could react better to unexpected events in the second half of the year.
The additional borrowing of up to 50 billion euros would come on top of Berlin's debt-financed supplementary budget worth 156 billion euros agreed in March.
This means the government's overall net new borrowing could balloon beyond 200 billion euros this year, equivalent of roughly 6% of Germany's economic output.
In addition, the government in March issued debt authorization of up to 100 billion euros for its economic stability fund that can take direct equity stakes in companies and up to 100 billion euros in further credit to public-sector development bank KfW for loans to struggling businesses.
A finance ministry spokesman declined to comment on the exact figure of additional debt.

The government predicts Germany's debt-to-GDP ratio to jump to more than 75% this year from just below 60% in 2019, a leap in German borrowing not seen since a massive stimulus boost during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.

The North African country of 100 million people is facing economic repercussions from the spread of the new coronavirus, which essentially shut down its vital tourism sector from mid-March.
Egypt also imposed a nightly curfew, closed schools and universities, and shut restaurants and cafes to slow the spread of the disease.
The May inflation rate dropped as food and beverage costs declined 0.3% year-on-year, CAPMAS data showed, reflecting a drop in demand during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, when it normally surges.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile items such as food, fell to 1.5% year-on-year in May, from 2.5% in April, the central bank said on Wednesday.
Month-on-month urban inflation registered 0%, CAPMAS said.
""From a monetary policy angle, this is considered good news because it ensures stability for interest rates going forward. However, month-on-month inflation could start going back up in June and July,"" said Allen Sandeep, head of research at Naeem Brokerage.
The International Monetary Fund in May approved $2.77 billion in emergency financing to help Egypt grapple with the new coronavirus pandemic through its rapid financing instrument.
Egypt then reached a staff-level agreement with the lender for a one-year, $5.2 billion standby loan, which the IMF's executive board is expected to consider in the coming weeks.

""Subdued inflation, in addition to the news that the authorities have reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF for a one-year $5.2bn stand-by arrangement, means that the environment is becoming much more conducive for the central bank to resume its easing cycle over the coming months in order to support the struggling economy,"" Capital Economics said in a note on Wednesday.

WELLINGBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Want to get back to work? Put your staff in a cardboard box.
That is the advice of a British company making social distancing screens from recycled cardboard to help businesses open up after lockdown while keeping staff safe.
""As people have started to come back to work we've switched to making a range of distancing-at-work products such as free-standing screens, counter screens and desk partitions,"" Iain Hulmes, Chief Executive at Pallite, told Reuters.
The company, 70 miles (112km) northwest of London, used to make recyclable cardboard pallets and boxes for industry but has now developed an entirely new range of products to cope with new workplace demands in the wake of the pandemic including wall screens, desk and table dividers with clear polyester film windows, free-standing signs and even pop-up desks for homeworkers.
""One of our workers at home found that she was struggling to work at home so we created a pop-up desk. That desk has sold over 5000 units in just five weeks with nothing but 5 star reviews,"" Hulmes said.
Three sizes of desks, all made from laminated honeycomb paper, can hold 50kg of weight and can be assembled in less than a minute. A desk for an adult costs 26 pounds.
Not far from Pallite's Wellingborough factory is Concept Conversions who sent all their staff home for the lockdown apart from four people all working in separate rooms.
Director, Ralph Allen, says he is trying to have some fun with themes and colours while using Pallite social distancing measures to keep his staff safe as they return to the office.

""It's pretty extreme to put your staff into cardboard boxes so the reason for cutting the windows and trimming them in those colours was because I've got a Manchester United supporter sitting at my desk and I support Liverpool. Well, that could become Liverpool again couldn't it?"" he said referring to the red trim.

Risks around Britain's future relationship with the EU were compounding the uncertainty about the duration of COVID-19 restrictions on the economy, the OECD said.
""The failure to conclude a trade deal with the European Union by the end of 2020 or put in place alternative arrangements would have a strongly negative effect on trade and jobs,"" it said in an update of its global economic forecasts.

1332,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",Yield control bets increase as investors wait for Fed,"By Karen Brettell and Kate Duguid
(Reuters) - As investors weigh the chances the Federal Reserve will take new measures to ensure short-term interest rates remain anchored near zero for the next several years, strategies that aim to capitalize on a likely steepening of the Treasury yield curve are looking more appealing.
Bond market players are increasingly convinced one of the Fed's next moves will be to cap yields at a specific point on the curve, by buying 2- or 3-year maturities for example, to reinforce their guidance that rates are not going up anytime soon. 
While the Fed's policy statement on Wednesday at the close of its two-day policy meeting may be too soon to see this kicked off, comments from top Fed officials have fueled expectations that so-called yield-curve control is the next new thing the Fed will roll out to try to foster a solid recovery from the COVID-19 recession that began in February.
""It should be investors' base case at this point that we get some form of yield curve control in the new few meetings,"" said Gene Tannuzzo, deputy global head of fixed income at Columbia Threadneedle. ""It's a new tool in their toolbox and there’s no reason they wouldn't expand it to the five-year, 10-year or 30-year if it fit their objectives.”
The yield curve is measured by a line plotting the rates of different maturities. A steepening curve, when longer-dated yields rise faster than shorter-dated ones, generally signals a bright economic outlook. Yields move inversely to the price of a bond.
Analysts at TD Securities on Friday recommended investors buy five-year notes, saying the Fed is likely to implement yield-curve control on notes out to three years by year-end, which should also help anchor five-year yields.
The Fed is ""probably willing to let the yield curve – from the intermediate-term to the 30-year – to steepen out somewhat,"" Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine, said in a webcast on Tuesday. 
BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) recommends entering into so-called steepening trades that benefit when the gap between two-year and 10-year note yields widens. It says yield curve controls will anchor short-dated debt yields while improving economic data and heavy Treasury supply will weigh on longer-dated debt.
Benchmark Treasury yields fell to record lows in March as fears over the spread of the coronavirus grew and the Fed slashed the target range for the federal funds rate to between zero and 0.25% in response to the crisis.
Since then, yields have risen on optimism that the economic recovery will be faster than previously expected.
U.S. two-year yields (US2YT=RR) were last at 0.21% after reaching 0.24% on Friday, while three-year yields (US3YT=RR) were 0.26% after rising as high as 0.32% Friday. Five-year yields (US5YT=RR) were at 0.40%, after reaching 0.51% Friday. 
The Fed is seen as unlikely to place caps on longer-dated yields anytime soon, although it is expected to continue its bond purchase program that includes longer-ended debt, and it could increase these purchases if yields continue to spike.
""The back end of the curve is more sensitive to market expectations of the recovery,"" said Erin Browne, a managing director and portfolio manager focused on asset allocation at Pimco, who expects the steepening to continue. 
Targeting short-term debt would be similar to a policy adopted by Australia’s central bank in March, when it implemented a yield target of 0.25% for three-year government bonds. It contrasts with the Bank of Japan, which adopted negative rates as it faces a larger struggle in stimulating the Japanese economy and lifting inflation and has a yield-curve control strategy targeted at the 10-year tenor.
Indeed, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida used the example of the Reserve Bank of Australia on May 21, saying yield-curve control was ""a natural complement to calendar-based guidance.""
Still, it may be several months until the market gets concrete news on yield control. Curve control ""will happen but not yet,"" said Nick Maroutsos, co-head of global bonds at Janus Henderson Investors, about Wednesday's Fed meeting. 

""We will likely get some forward guidance and the standard commitment to maintain stimulus where needed,"" he said. ""In my opinion it will be a snoozer.""

1333,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 06:26AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday, June 10th","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com -- The OECD offers up a bleak assessment of the impact to the global economy this year, as the market looks to the latest U.S. inflation and crude inventories data ahead of the Federal Reserve offering up its outlook for the U.S. economy. Still, the Nasdaq is at an all-time high. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, June 10th.
1. It’s all about the Fed
The Federal Open Market Committee's two-day meeting ends later Wednesday, and the statement emerging from this get together will form the focus of today’s activity.
The Fed, along with the Treasury and Congress, have pumped trillions in stimulus to support businesses that were forced to shut down because of Covid-19.
“There will be no rate changes,” analysts at Nordea wrote, in their preview piece last week. “The Fed has clearly dismissed the idea of going to negative while also stating that the target range will remain unchanged ‘until the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve maximum employment and price stability’. These goals are Fed miles off from achieving at the moment.”
Thus the focus will be partly on forward guidance tools such as yield curve control, partly on updated economic projections, particularly after Friday’s shock employment report.
2. Coronavirus to provoke worst recession for 100 years - OECD
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development revised Wednesday its forecasts for the damage the coronavirus pandemic is likely to do to the global economy, and the news wasn’t good.
“Economic impacts are dire everywhere,” the OECD summarized in its Economic Outlook, saying that the global economy is on track to suffer the worst recession outside of wartime in 100 years.
“The recovery will be slow and the crisis will have long-lasting effects, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable people.”
The OECD said global growth will contract by 7.6% in 2020, assuming there is a second wave of Covid-19 infections. If a second wave is avoided there would still be a drop of 6% this year.
These figures suggest more than twice the devastation to the global economy than its previous forecast released in early March, before the full extent of the crisis became apparent.
They are also worse than the 5.2% contraction in 2020 the World Bank offered up on Monday, in its latest Global Economic Prospects report.
3. CPI data on the slate
The U.S. consumer price index data for May is scheduled to be released at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), and is forecast to grow 0.2% in May compared with the same month last year, but to decline 0.1% since April. 
Total consumer prices fell 0.8% in April, the sharpest drop since the end of 2008 after energy prices plummeted.
Core CPI, which excludes energy and food prices, is expected to increase 1.3% since last May, but drop 0.1% since April.
Earlier Wednesday, data showed that China's producer prices fell by the sharpest rate in more than four years, dropping 3.7% from a year earlier, the sharpest decline since March 2016. 
4. Stocks set to open mixed; Nasdaq at all-time high
U.S. stock markets are set to open mixed, with the tech stocks-dominated Nasdaq Composite index leading the way.
By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), theDow Jones 30 futures contract was down 113 points or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was 0.1% higher.
The Nasdaq ended at an all-time high for a second straight day Tuesday after briefly rising above the 10,000 mark for the first time. Its gains came on the back of strong gains in tech-related shares, a day after the index became the first of Wall Street's major indexes to confirm a new bull market.
5. Crude inventories data due
Crude oil prices traded lower Wednesday, weighed by the American Petroleum Institute reporting late Tuesday that U.S. crude supplies rose by 8.4 million barrels for the week ended June 5. 
This was very different from the small drawdown in stocks that the market was expecting, and raises fears of a supply glut.
Attention now turns to the official weekly crude oil inventories data, at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT). The expectation is for a decline of 1.74 million barrels for the week ending June 5 compared with a decline of just over 2 million barrels the previous week.
Gasoline inventories are also expected to fall 71,000 barrels compared to a gain of 2.8 million barrels. 
By 6:30 AM ET, Crude Oil WTI Futures were down 2.7% at $37.89 a barrel, while the global benchmark Brent was 2.2% lower at $40.27 a barrel.
The Australian think tank the Institute for Economics and Peace warned Wednesday that the impact of coronavirus may “result in the collapse of the shale oil industry in the U.S., unless oil prices return to their prior levels.”

1334,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>",Bulgaria cuts taxes for restaurants and catering services,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria's parliament on Wednesday approved government plans to cut value added tax (VAT) on food provided by restaurants and catering services to 9% from 20% from July to help an industry hit hard by the coronavirus crisis.
The cut would run through 2021 as a temporary measure to help the sector recover. It would not affect alcoholic drinks bought in restaurants and provided by caterers, which will still attract a 20% VAT rate.
The plan was floated by Prime Minister Boyko Borissov last month despite opposition from his finance minister. It was also criticised by economists who say it would open the door for many more industries to seek tax cuts.
The country sees its economy shrinking by 3% in 2020, while the European Commission expects it to contract by 7.2% this year.
VAT, set at 20% for all goods and services except hotels, is the main revenue source for the country, which keeps income and corporate taxes at 10% - among the lowest in the European Union.
The deputies also voted to cut VAT on books, some baby foods, and diapers to 9% from July until the end of next year.

1335,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>","China's new bank loans fall in May, but broader credit growth quickens","By Judy Hua and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - New bank lending in China fell more than expected in May but broader credit growth quickened as the central bank continues to ease policy to get the economy back on solid footing after the coronavirus crisis.
Banks extended 1.48 trillion yuan ($209.47 billion) in new yuan loans in May, down from 1.70 trillion yuan in April, according to data released by the People's Bank of China (OTC:BACHY) (PBOC) on Wednesday.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted loans would fall to 1.50 trillion yuan. But the tally was higher than 1.18 trillion yuan in the same month last year.
Household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 704.3 billion yuan from 666.9 billion yuan in April, while corporate loans fell to 845.9 billion yuan from 956.3 billion yuan.
Broad M2 money supply grew 11.1% from a year earlier, below estimates of 11.3% but in line with April's rise.
The monthly lending figures are highly seasonal, so analysts tend to focus on annual changes to gauge underlying trends. As expected, outstanding yuan loans grew 13.2% on-year, edging up from 13.1% in April.
""We think credit growth will continue to accelerate in the months ahead given loose monetary conditions, political pressure on banks to lend more and plans for a further ramp up in government borrowing,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics said, noting a jump in government bond issuance had pushed broader growth to a 21-month high.
""This should drive a strong rebound in investment and help shore up economic activity in the near-term. But further ahead, another round of state-led stimulus will worsen resource allocation and lead to a jump in debt levels."" 
Pan Gongsheng, vice governor of the PBOC, said last week that the economic hit from the pandemic was bigger than first expected and that more policy support was needed.
The PBOC has already rolled out a raft of easing steps since early February, including cuts in reserve requirements and lending rates and targeted lending support for virus-hit firms.
Reflecting the uncertain outlook, China set no annual growth target this year for the first time since 2002 and pledged more government spending. But expectations of a global recession are compounding the challenges.
Premier Li Keqiang said last month that monetary policy would be more flexible, and growth of M2 - a broad gauge of money supply - and total social financing would be significantly higher.
Growth of outstanding total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, quickened to 12.5% in May from a year earlier, from 12% in April.
TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
In May, TSF rose to 3.19 trillion yuan from 3.09 trillion yuan in April. Analysts had expected 3.00 trillion yuan.
BOND ISSUANCE BOOSTS BROAD CREDIT GROWTH
Analysts expect the central bank to cut banks' reserve requirement ratios and lending rates further in coming months, although it recently unveiled more targeted tools to boost lending to small firms.
Beijing has been leaning more heavily on fiscal stimulus to weather the downturn, cutting taxes and issuing local government bonds to fund infrastructure projects.
The government has fixed the quota on local government special bond issuance at 3.75 trillion yuan, up from 2.15 trillion yuan.
The government will also issue 1 trillion yuan in special treasury bonds this year.

Local governments issued 2.15 trillion yuan in special bonds in the first five months of this year.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Umesh Patil, a farmer in western India, pawned 40 grams of gold jewellery to raise 130,000 rupees ($1,723.11) to buy supplies needed to plant his next crop.
Many Indians are using gold to secure loans, bankers and industry experts say, as banks are otherwise increasingly unwilling to lend during the coronavirus pandemic due to fear of the loan souring.
""State-run banks were seeking lots of documents for crop loans and furnishing them all wasn't possible quickly,"" said Patil, whose farm is in Sangli district, nearly 400 km (250 miles) from Mumbai.
""So I decided to pawn jewellery. I got a loan from a local co-operative bank in just an hour.""
Using gold as security is not unusual in India, but gold-backed loans are becoming more popular with banks, which tend to consider them safer than other unsecured borrowing.
India's economy is expected to contract this financial year as the pandemic ravages activity worldwide, and there are growing concerns that people will struggle to repay riskier business and personal loans.
Overall loan growth in India's banking system has already been decelerating and is expected to hit a multi-decade low of 0 to 1% in this financial year due to the fallout from the pandemic, said credit rating agency Crisil.
""As banks could exhibit greater risk aversion in the current context, gold loans would be a convenient route for many customers to raise liquidity and working capital,"" said Somasundaram P.R., head of the World Gold Council's Indian operations.
George Alexander Muthoot, managing director at gold-financing company Muthoot Finance, said he was seeing demand ""from all quarters"" as people took out short-term loans to tide over uncertainties. He said the average gold loan was around 40,000 rupees ($529.87).
Several state-owned and private banks are also coming out with promotional offers around these loans to lure customers.
""We're actively promoting gold loans and seeing good traction,"" Ashutosh Khajuria, the chief financial officer of Federal Bank (NS:FED), said.
""We may be able to clock in the same growth as last financial year of 29% or even higher.""

Portuguese Finance Minister Centeno said on Tuesday that he would not seek a second 2.5-year term as chairman of the euro zone finance ministers. Spain has long had an eye on that job and officials in Brussels have said Calvino is among the favourites.
""I think the presidency of the Eurogroup is very relevant,"" Spain's Social Security Minister Jose Luis Escriva told Spanish broadcaster TVE.
The new leader of the 19 euro zone finance ministers is to be chosen on July 9th.
Calvino has been economy minister since June 2018. She is also deputy prime minister in the cabinet led by Pedro Sanchez. If appointed Eurogroup chair, she would be the first woman to lead the group.

But with Spain also said to be eyeing the leadership of the World Trade Organisation for Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya, Madrid may have to choose between which post it wants to lobby for most, all the more so as it already has a top EU job with Josep Borrell as the bloc's foreign policy chief.

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>",Exclusive: ECB prepares 'bad bank' plan for wave of coronavirus toxic debt,"By Matt Scuffham and John O'Donnell
LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank officials are drawing up a scheme to cope with potentially hundreds of billions of euros of unpaid loans in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The project, which comes as Europe mobilises trillions of euros to bolster the region's economy, is aimed at shielding commercial banks from any second fallout from the crisis, if rising unemployment chokes off the income needed to repay loans.
One of the people familiar with the plan said the ECB had set up a task force to look at the idea of a ""bad bank"" to warehouse unpaid euro debt and that work on the scheme had accelerated in recent weeks.
The ECB declined to comment on whether it was working on a bad bank scheme.
The amount of debt in the euro zone that is considered unlikely to ever be fully repaid already stands at more than half a trillion euros, including credit cards, car loans and mortgages, according to official statistics. 
That is set to rise as the COVID-19 outbreak squeezes borrowers and could even double to one trillion euros, weighing on already fragile banks and hindering new lending, the people familiar with the ECB plans said.
While the idea for a euro zone bad bank was discussed and shelved over two years ago, the ECB, under its new President Christine Lagarde, has consulted banks and EU officials about a scheme in recent weeks, one of the people said.
As the euro zone's most powerful institution, ECB backing for the project is critical but it would also require the blessing of Germany, the bloc's biggest economy. 
Berlin has long opposed schemes that accept shared responsibility for debts in other countries although it recently had an unexpected change of heart, agreeing to pool EU borrowing for a coronavirus recovery fund.
'PREMATURE'
One blueprint under discussion would involve the European Stability Mechanism, an EU institution which can provide financial assistance to euro zone countries or lenders, standing in as guarantor for the bad bank, the people said. 
The bad bank would then issue bonds which commercial banks would buy in exchange for portfolios of unpaid loans, neutralising the virus shock for Europe's lenders. The banks could then lodge those bonds with the ECB as collateral for central bank funding, one of the people said.
Major European commercial banks could be called on to join forces to underpin the scheme, the second person said. 
While European countries are now focused on launching a 750 billion euro plan to help economies hit by COVID-19, the idea of a bad bank, and the ECB blueprint, could come up for discussion among central bank governors and ministers later this year. 
Asked on Tuesday about bad banks, Andrea Enria, the ECB's chief bank supervisor, said while he supported the concept, it was ""premature"" to discuss one now because it was not clear how severe the impact of the coronavirus outbreak would be. 
""I have been very supportive of asset management companies. I think they are useful,"" he told reporters, highlighting the success of bad banks in Spain and Ireland in the aftermath of the financial crisis. ""Many of these schemes have ended up in the black, making profits.""
Enria said the ECB was studying how banks could cope were the crisis to worsen. He said banks had more than 600 billion euros ($680 billion) of capital and this would probably be enough, unless there were a second wave of infections. 
ACT FAST
Still, any pan-European scheme to tackle the problem of bad loans would likely face political objections from Germany, which has long resisted attempts to support banks in weaker countries for fear it could get lumbered with unpaid bills.
Markus Ferber, a German member of the European Parliament, said Berlin remained opposed to taking on such mutual guarantees. ""National bad banks could be a first step,"" he said.
Marco Zanni, an Italian lawmaker in the parliament, said the EU decision making process was too complicated and too slow.
""Looking at the past crises, the experience is that European solutions come too late,"" he said. ""When you're facing a crisis ... you need to act in days or weeks, not months or years."" 
Banks in Italy and Greece, for example, were still recuperating from the fallout from the financial crisis more than a decade earlier when the pandemic struck.
But while the problem of unpaid loans has been concentrated chiefly in poorer EU countries since the 2008 crash, the widespread impact of the coronavirus, which has hit Germany hard, could see borrowers everywhere struggle.
The European Commission, the EU's executive branch, said it had outlined how bad bank schemes could function but no ""formal work"" was underway. It said banks had been given more regulatory leeway but could ""explore all relevant possibilities"" if needed.
""European banks are already preparing for another wave of bad debts,"" said Andrew Orr of accountancy firm Deloitte.
""Having a European bad bank would help. For the bad debt itself, nothing changes. The debts still need to be worked through and the money still has to be paid back.""

India's overall engineering exports, comprising industrial machinery and auto parts, constitute nearly a quarter of total goods exports, contracting in April and May due to the coronavirus and weak global demand, traders said.
""Singapore has replaced the U.S. as the number one destination for Indian engineering exports,"" said Ravi Sehgal, chairman of the India'a Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC).
Engineering exports to China were up 19% year on year to $173 million, he said.
However, total engineering exports were down 63.9% in April to $2.31 billion from $6.4 billion, the EEPC said. In April, for which latest data is available, engineering exports to the United States declined 75% to $222 million.
India is due to release monthly trade data for May next week and is widely expected to report another fall in exports.
Singapore imports electrical machinery, components, aircraft and ship parts and non-ferrous metal from India, the trade body said, adding there was a more than five-fold rise in exports of non-ferrous metal to Singapore in April from a year earlier.

Over the last few years, Singapore has emerged among the top 10 destinations for Indian engineering exporters, with exports of more than $80 billion in 2018/19.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England looks set to give itself at least another 100 billion pounds ($127 billion) in bond-buying firepower next week to try to stop the coronavirus crisis from inflicting further damage on Britain's economy.
The BoE slashed interest rates to an all-time low of 0.1% in March as the country went into lockdown, but it says it needs time to weigh up the risks of going below zero like some other central banks.
That leaves bond-buying as its main weapon for tackling what could be Britain's deepest recession in three centuries.
The BoE is amassing gilts faster than the government is selling them in order to prevent the debt flood from pushing up borrowing costs.
It has already used up most of a record 200 billion pound expansion of its asset purchase programme made in March. 
Most economists say the Monetary Policy Committee will announce another 100 billion pound boost on June 18.
That would be enough for the BoE to keep buying bonds at its current pace until August, when the MPC is next due to meet. By then there should be a few more signals of how much long-term damage has been done to the world's fifth-biggest economy.
Data on Friday is expected to show Britain's gross domestic product plunged by about 20% in April although there have been some signs of a recent bottoming out of the slump.
Cathal Kennedy, an economist with RBC Capital Markets, expects a 200 billion pound increase, in line with the BoE's tendency to buy more bonds than the government plans to sell.
Such a move could revive claims that the BoE has given up its independence to finance the government's huge spending increases, a claim that Governor Andrew Bailey and other top officials deny. 
Analysts at NatWest Markets said they expected the BoE would slow the pace of its bond-buying, meaning the next increase in the programme might not happen until November. 
Samuel Tombs, of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the BoE was unlikely to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank and make longer-term bond-buying commitments.
Uncertainty about whether Britain will end its post-Brexit transition agreement with a new European Union trade deal at the end of 2020 made this too much of a risk for the BoE.
""It does not know whether the combination of the supply side shock from no EU trade deal being signed and the likely depreciation of sterling would have a bigger influence on inflation than the hit to demand,"" Tombs said. ""Accordingly, we expect the MPC to stick to rolling QE extensions.""

All European Union members besides Denmark are obliged to join the euro, but most are dragging their feet, mostly because of lingering doubts over the currency's viability since the bloc's debt crisis nearly a decade ago. 
Although Croatia and Bulgaria are both in the process of applying and have made progress, both struggle with some criteria, particularly with regard to governance, an area the EU in increasingly focusing on, the ECB's biennial Convergence Report showed. 
""Except in Sweden, the quality of institutions and governance is relatively weak in the countries under review – especially in Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Hungary,"" the ECB said.
Inflation is higher than allowed in five of the seven prospective countries and the ECB said it was concerned over the sustainability of inflation convergence in most of them.
The ECB targets inflation at below 2% but has undershot that target for the past seven years. Most central European states are running inflation rates closer to or above 3%.
But most countries met criteria on debt, deficit and interest rates, the ECB said, adding that its report only considers the impact of the coronavirus pandemic to a limited extent, given the unusual uncertainty it has created.
Still, it noted that most of the countries are facing a surge in budget deficits, a consequence of spending everywhere to weather the pandemic.

The ECB added that none of the countries complied with the legal requirements for central bank independence and all but Croatia failed to meet the requirement on the prohibition of monetary financing, key foundations of modern central banking.

Muller's comments suggest limits to the flexibility that the ECB maintains its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) includes and allows it to deviate from this ""capital key"".
The ECB scooped up all of Italy's new debt in April and May, buying well above the country's capital key quota, even if it merely managed to keep borrowing costs from rising. 
Muller's specific reference to proportionality may also indicate increased caution by ECB policymakers after Germany's top court ruled it exceeded its powers with another purchase scheme because it failed to prove it was proportional. 
""It's important that the agreed flexibility in the programme is somewhat larger than in other asset purchase programmes but the limit in the capital key has a reason,"" Muller said.
""In the end, we have to make sure that we create policy for all euro zone countries and it should have a proportional effect,"" the Estonian central bank chief told a news conference.
The ECB last week increased PEPP by 600 billion euros but Muller said the scheme must be temporary and unless growth deteriorates further, another may not be necessary.

""If the economic growth recovers in the second half as ECB forecasts and the inflation outlook does not significantly weaken, then probably an additional increase in asset purchases is not needed,"" Muller added.

PARIS (Reuters) - The global economy will suffer the biggest peace-time downturn in a century before it emerges next year from a coronavirus-inflicted recession, the OECD said on Wednesday.
Updating its outlook, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) forecast the global economy would contract 6.0% this year before bouncing back with 5.2% growth in 2021 - providing the outbreak is kept under control.
However, the Paris-based policy forum said an equally possible scenario of a second wave of contagion this year could see the global econmy contract 7.6% before growing only 2.8% next year.
""By the end of 2021, the loss of income exceeds that of any previous recession over the last 100 years outside wartime, with dire and long-lasting consequences for people, firms and governments,"" OECD chief economist Laurence Boone wrote in an introduction to the refreshed outlook.
With crisis responses set to shape economic and social prospects for the coming decade, she urged governments not to shy away from debt-financed spending to support low-paid workers and investment.
""Ultra-accommodative monetary policies and higher public debt are necessary and will be accepted as long as economic activity and inflation are depressed, and unemployment is high,"" Boone said. 
As the threat of a second wave of contagion keeps uncertainty high, Boone said now was no time to fan the flames of trade tensions and governments should cooperate on a treatment and vaccine for the virus. 
The U.S economy, the world's biggest, is seen contracting 7.3% this year before growing 4.1% next year. In the event of a second outbreak, the U.S. recession would reach 8.5% this year and the economy would grow only 1.9% in 2021, the OECD said.
Meanwhile, the euro area is heading for a downturn of 9.1% this year followed by 6.5% growth next year. But the recession could reach 11.5% this year in the event of a second outbreak, followed by growth of 3.5% in 2021.

Britain is expected to see the worst downturn among the countries covered by the OECD, with its economy forecast to contract 11.5% this year before recovering 9.0% next year. A second outbreak could trigger a slump of 14.0% this year followed by a rebound of 5.0% next year, the OECD said.

The EU has long sought to encourage companies to issue stocks and bonds to grow. But they still rely on banks for funding after efforts to build a capital markets union (CMU) failed to make significant headway.
A ""high level forum"" of experts set out 17 recommendations on Wednesday to accelerate the CMU project by calling for top political backing in advance and a granular timetable for implementation in a bid to overcome flaws in past efforts.
It recommended giving extra authority for the EU's securities and insurance regulators and for streamlining tax and insolvency rules, sensitive areas that have been stumbling blocks in the past.
""The European banking system, although better capitalised and more resilient, is not sufficient by itself to provide the amount of credit the EU economy will need to recover from the crisis,"" the report said.
Britain, Europe's largest capital market, has left the EU, making the bloc's economy dependent on a jurisdiction where rules may start to diverge, it said.
""With the UK having left a question for politicians is how much of this market one wants onshore, and how much offshore.""

1346,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 04:09AM ET</span>","Virus Splinters Global Economy, Exposing Inequality Faultlines","(Bloomberg) --
The coronavirus pandemic is splintering the world economy, and its impact on businesses and the most vulnerable will require extraordinary government action, the OECD warned.
It made the grim assessment in its quarterly outlook, where it forecast a global slump of 6% this year, more than the World Bank earlier this week. That’s based on a scenario of the virus continuing to recede. A second wave, which the OECD said is an equally likely scenario, could mean a 7.6% contraction.
Given the already clear impact of virus-related restrictions and lockdowns, the outlook is unsurprising. But the OECD also highlighted deepening fault lines created by the virus, including wide economic divergences across countries based on the severity of the outbreak, health systems, and the fiscal capacity of governments to respond. More trade restrictions are springing up, and lockdowns have heightened inequalities between workers, with the youngest and least qualified on the front line.
With some sectors facing long-term damage -- airlines have already announced thousands of job cuts -- the OECD also warned that an increase in bankruptcies and sustained period of unemployment is likely. Governments must adapt support to help that transition and provide protection.
“By the end of 2021, the loss of income exceeds that of any previous recession over the last 100 years outside wartime, with dire and long-lasting consequences,” OECD chief economist Laurence Boone said. “The pandemic has accelerated the shift from ‘great integration’ to ‘great fragmentation.’”
Policy Tightrope
In the outlook, the organization sees the U.S. shrinking more than 7% in 2020 in the “single-hit scenario” while the euro area suffers a 9% hit. Italy, France and the U.K. will all shrink more than 11%.
It’s an unprecedented challenge for governments, who’ve already spent billions to keep businesses afloat and workers in jobs until their economies reopen. The OECD said policy makers will have to walk a “tightrope” between continuing to provide exceptional -- and costly -- safety nets and not being trapped into upholding activity for a long period.
“We’ve never seen such uncertainty,” Boone said. “That’s the most difficult thing in this crisis -- things have to evolve week by week because the situation may change so dramatically.”
Governments must pay particularly attention to the most vulnerable, according to the report. The young and low-paid are make up a larger share of the workforce in the sectors most exposed to job losses and health risks, while highly qualified workers have more often been able to work at home.
“Everywhere, the lockdown has also exacerbated inequality across workers,” Boone said.
Policymakers should be careful not to withdraw support too fast, even with exceptionally high levels of public debt and an already dramatic increase in central bank balance sheets, the OECD said. In the bleaker double-dip scenario, it would fall to fiscal authorities to provide more stimulus with limited scope for monetary policy.
“It’s really important we don’t repeat the mistake of the financial crisis and that we do support this transition until growth and employment growth regains momentum,” Boone said.

The bank, which has previously been censured by FINMA over its efforts to combat money laundering, confirmed the latest investigation.
The paper said the former customer was a well-known Argentine entrepreneur who is suspected of siphoning off more than 50 million Swiss francs ($52.7 million) from his company between 2007 and 2016 and moving it into several accounts at Julius Baer.
Employees at the bank discovered irregularities in these accounts in 2016 and its internal audit instructed compliance officials to conduct in-depth clarifications about the customer and his transactions. As a result, his accounts with the bank were closed. The money laundering reporting office appears not to have been informed of the events, the paper said.
In February FINMA said it had found serious shortcomings in Julius Baer's anti-money laundering processes between 2009 and early 2018.
The failings were connected to alleged corruption linked to Venezuelan oil company PDVSA and world soccer federation FIFA, resulting in enforcement proceedings which FINMA had concluded.
The bank last year appointed Philipp Rickenbacher as chief executive to replace Bernhard Hodler, the former risk chief who took over when Boris Collardi left in 2017 to help to run unlisted rival Pictet.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Coronavirus cases and hospitalizations are spiking in parts of California and the U.S. Southwest, prompting Arizona to reactivate its emergency plan for medical facilities and California to place counties where half its population lives on a watch list.
The uptick in cases, which could lead authorities to reimpose or tighten public health restrictions aimed at slowing the virus' spread, complicates efforts to reopen the U.S. economy, which has been devastated by shelter-at-home rules.
New Jersey, one of the states hit hardest by the pandemic, with over 12,000 deaths, lifted its stay-at-home order on Tuesday.
More than 18 million of California's 39 million residents live in counties now on the watch list, which includes Los Angeles, Santa Clara and Fresno, a Reuters analysis showed.
""Many of the cases that are showing up in hospitals are linked to gatherings that are taking place in homes - birthday parties and funerals,"" said Olivia Kasirye, public health director of Sacramento County, one of the nine counties on the state watch list that may eventually require them to roll back reopening efforts. 
Arizona was among the first states to reopen in mid-May and its cases have increased 115% since then, leading a former state health chief to warn that a new stay-at-home order or field hospitals may be needed. 
According to a Reuters tally, there were 1,983,825 coronavirus cases in the United States and 111,747 deaths as of Tuesday. 
21 STATES SEE INCREASES
On Tuesday, 21 U.S. states reported weekly increases in new cases of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Arizona, Utah and New Mexico all posted rises of 40% or higher for the week ended Sunday, compared with the prior seven days, according to a Reuters analysis.
Some of the new cases are linked to better testing. But many stem from loosened public health restrictions that have allowed people to gather in groups and go inside stores to shop, said public health officers in two California counties.
Health officials believe other cases have been passed along by people not following social-distancing recommendations. It is too soon to see whether cases will also spike after protests swept the country over the May 25 death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, an African-American man, officials said.
The number of new infections in the first week of June rose 3% in the United States, the first increase after five weeks of declines, according to an analysis of data from the COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer-run effort to track the outbreak. 
But pressure to reopen economies is great, and states continued to lift coronavirus-related restrictions on Tuesday. 
New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said indoor crowds such as those attending religious services in churches, synagogues and mosques may include up to 50 people and outdoor gatherings could swell to 100 people.
In Washington state, the site of one of the earliest outbreaks of COVID-19, Governor Jay Inslee said nannies, housekeepers and personal chefs could go back to work, and people from different households could ride in the same golf cart.
University of Washington researchers estimated on Monday that 145,728 people could die of COVID-19 in the United States by August, raising their forecast by over 5,000 fatalities in a matter of days. The model changes as researchers take fresh account of people's mobility as stay-at-home orders change.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economy, facing its first recession in 30 years because of the coronavirus, would suffer if Chinese students heeded a warning from their government to stay away because of racist incidents, Australia's trade minister said on Wednesday.
International education is Australia's fourth-largest foreign exchange earner, worth A$38 billion ($26 billion) annually, and more critical to the economy than beef or barley, products hit with Chinese import bans and tariffs last month.
China is Australia's most important trading partner and sends the most international students, accounting for 37.3% of 442,209 overseas students in higher education in 2019, according to Department of Education data. 
On Tuesday, China's Ministry of Education warned students to reconsider returning to Australia, saying there had been a spate of racist incidents targeting Asians during the coronavirus pandemic. It followed a warning last week for Chinese tourists to avoid Australia. 
""We would feel the effect - our universities would, if we saw a downturn in international student numbers,"" trade minister Simon Birmingham told media.
Birmingham said it would also be a loss for Chinese students and in the long term ""would do nothing to help further the mutual understanding between our two nations"". 
On Tuesday, Birmingham said Australia had ""zero tolerance"" toward racism and had established processes to stamp it out.
Australia's relations with China have deteriorated in recent years amid accusations that China is meddling in Australia's affairs and seeking undue influence in the Pacific region. 
Ties have been under more strain since Australia called for an international enquiry into the origins of the novel coronavirus.
After the enquiry call, Cheng Jingye, China's ambassador to Australia, said Chinese consumers could boycott Australian beef, wine, tourism and universities.
China has said the trade actions since then are unrelated to the push for an inquiry. 
'PAWN'
Vicki Thomson, chief executive of the Group of Eight, representing Australia's top universities, told Reuters universities were being dragged into the diplomatic dispute.
""International education is being used as a political pawn,"" she said.
Thomson said the Chinese embassy had told her on Tuesday it hadn't received any reports of students being attacked during the pandemic. She said the embassy had reassured that student travel would not be targeted and she was ""concerned and disappointed"" about the warning.
About 20,000 Chinese students enrolled at Group of Eight universities are offshore because of coronavirus travel restrictions and studying online, Thomson said.
""We have a strong record of safety across Australia,"" she said.
Australia had ranked second only to New Zealand as an attractive place to study because of its handling of the coronavirus, a survey of 400 education agents by Navitas found, she said.
However, there has been domestic criticism that the university sector is too reliant on student fees from one country.
The Audit Office of the New South Wales government found course fees from overseas students, worth A$3.6 billion, made up a third of university revenue in the state in 2019. 
At the University of NSW, University of Sydney, and University of Wollongong, income from overseas students, predominantly Chinese, exceeded that from domestic students.
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service vice president John Manning said the travel restrictions to stop the coronavirus would limit the impact of China's warning on universities' revenue this year. 

""In the longer term, with a number of universities ranked amongst the best in the world, we expect Australia's institutions will remain attractive for international students,"" he said.

The January to March slowdown marked the fourth straight quarterly slide in Mexico's gross domestic product and its most anemic performance in more than a decade.
Finance Minister Arturo Herrera told local broadcaster W Radio that the worst of the coronavirus-led economic slowdown is probably over.
""We have some information that makes us think that the most difficult month was April, as (GDP) will likely have fallen around 17%,"" said Herrera, adding that the economy in May will have shrunk ""maybe a little less"" once official data is released.
The minister noted that the government launched a gradual re-opening of the economy at the beginning of this month, as officially-designated ""essential"" industries including carmaking, mining and construction have been allowed to restart operations provided safety protocols are followed.
Still, Mexico's central bank forecasts as much as an 8.8% contraction in 2020.

Private sector analysts paint an even dimmer picture, estimating that the economy will shrink by 10% or more this year.

Only half of European companies surveyed said that their mainland China revenues last year increased by 5% or more, the lowest proportion in a decade, according to a survey of members of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China conducted in February that involved 626 respondents in all.
A slowdown in the world's second largest economy was seen as the biggest business challenge by respondents. After widespread lockdowns to control the epidemic, China's economy shrank by 6.8% in the first quarter, and the government dropped a growth target for the full year. 
""The full extent of the negative impact from COVID-19 on revenue growth remains unclear, but the trend is undeniably bleak,"" said the report. 
Small and medium sized companies, and those in the chemicals, petroleum, automotive, construction, and logistics industries, were most likely to have seen falls in the growth of revenue and earnings before interest and tax in 2019, according to the report. These companies are also among those which have been hit hardest by the epidemic, it said. 
Only ""incremental"" improvements to China's regulatory environment were seen in 2019, according to the report, and 44% of surveyed members expected obstacles to increase over the next five years. 
In addition, nearly half of respondents expected China's powerful state-owned sector, a frequent source of complaints by foreign businesses, to gain opportunities at the expense of the private sector this year. 

""The COVID-19 outbreak looks likely to further exacerbate this problem, with the government now turning to SOEs as a source of stability in uncertain times, which can only be achieved by draining yet more resources from the private sector,"" said the report, referring to state-owned enterprises.

The Washington-based lender will disburse the first $2.1 billion loan tranche immediately, according to an emailed statement Tuesday. Ukraine needs money to help cover its budget deficit, which tripled as the government ramped up economic support amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
Ukraine initially sought the IMF assistance last year as a means of bolstering its foreign reserves and reassuring international investors that it was serious about overhauling its economy. But key requirements -- including the lifting of a moratorium on farmland sales and measures to protect the nationalization of the country’s biggest bank -- took much longer than envisioned to complete.
”The program will focus on safeguarding medium-term fiscal sustainability, preserving central bank independence and the flexible exchange rate, “ said IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva in the statement. “Concerted reform efforts aimed at tackling corruption and strengthening governance will be critical to ensure macroeconomic stability and achieve sustainable and inclusive growth.”
The financing approved by the board is for 18 months, rather than the originally planned three years, and the volume was reduced from an earlier $8 billion.
Ukraine’s economy will probably shrink 8.2% this year, the IMF said. Helping to cushion the blow, Tuesday’s deal unlocks additional funding from the World Bank and the European Union.

WASHINGTON/KIEV (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund's executive board approved on Tuesday a $5 billion loan deal for Ukraine that Kiev says is needed to stave off default as the coronavirus pandemic plunges the Eastern European country's economy into recession.
Ukraine will receive an immediate disbursement of about $2.1 billion from the 18-month Stand-By Arrangement, the IMF said in a statement.
""That's $200 mln more than originally planned,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on his official Twitter account. ""The new program funding will help us to overcome the challenges caused by #COVID19. The #IMF has proven itself to be a reliable partner to a friend in need.""
The rest of the funds will be spread over four reviews during the program, which focuses more on stability than deep structural reforms, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement.
Zelenskiy's government has trumpeted the agreement as a vote of confidence in its ability to deliver reforms, including a banking law that went against the interests of one of the country's wealthiest tycoons.
    One of Europe's poorest countries, Ukraine does not have the financial firepower for major stimulus measures to keep its economy afloat after imposing a nationwide lockdown in March that has shuttered or restricted many businesses.
    Securing the IMF funds also is expected to unlock financing from the European Union and other institutions.
Ukraine's economy is seen contracting around 5% this year, including a 12% second-quarter drop.
    The country has recorded 27,856 confirmed coronavirus cases, with 810 deaths, although the lockdown is gradually being lifted.
    To secure the IMF deal, Ukraine had to pass legislation that prevents the former owners of insolvent banks from regaining their assets. The move was viewed as aimed against the interests of Ihor Kolomoisky, who formerly owned the country's largest lender, PrivatBank - nationalized in 2016 - and who has waged a legal battle to regain control or receive government compensation.

Britain has already begun slowly opening for business after shuttering large swathes of the economy and ordering citizens to stay at home on March 23 to limit the spread of COVID-19 as the disease threatened to overwhelm the health system.
June 15 has already been flagged as the next stage of that process, and is when non-essential retailers and secondary schools will be allowed to open again, albeit with strict rules about the need for social distancing.
On Wednesday, Johnson will add zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas to the list.
""This is by necessity a careful process, but we hope the reopening of safari parks and zoos will help provide families with more options to spend time outdoors, while supporting the industry caring for these incredible animals,"" a spokeswoman from Johnson's office said.
The changes will be announced during the government's daily news conference, which normally takes place at 1600 GMT.
Ministers have taken radical steps to prop up the economy during the national lockdown, including an unprecedented scheme to pay workers' wages to limit job losses, and the opening of loan schemes and credit lines for businesses of all sizes.

That support has come at a high cost to the public purse, with borrowing set to reach levels not seen since World War Two.

The price paid to ranchers for cattle dropped and meat prices rose earlier this spring when operations at some slaughterhouses were slowed by workers falling ill with the new coronavirus, while others closed. President Donald Trump responded in May by insisting that the Justice Department open an antitrust probe.
The six lawmakers, led by the top Republican on the committee, Jim Jordan, urged Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to ""revisit burdensome regulations that create barriers to entry and lessen competition in the nation’s meat processing industry.""
The lawmakers requested that Perdue consider giving smaller processors ""more flexibility"" in handling Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point Plans to address food safety issues and to clarify and streamline the approval process for meat labels.
They also asked Perdue to reduce the regulatory burden keeping smaller meat processors from participating in a program that allows them to sell across state lines and to find a way to reduce the expense of inspections, which falls on meat processors if an inspector works overtime. 

Farmers have increasingly turned to small processors to slaughter their livestock as the pandemic hobbled big slaughterhouses run by companies like  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) and JBS USA. Around 80% of U.S. beef is produced by four large companies. In addition to Jordan, the letter was signed by Republican Representatives James Sensenbrenner, Ken Buck, Matt Gaetz, Kelly Armstrong and W. Gregory Steube.

The impact of coronavirus has added to existing questions that Conservative members of Parliament were asking about Johnson’s decision to allow Huawei Technologies Co. to supply equipment for the U.K.’s 5G network.
Answering questions at the government’s daily virus press conference Tuesday, Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the forthcoming National Security and Investment Bill will address these concerns.
“It’s important that we protect our critical assets,” he said. “We will look to see through the forthcoming bill when it comes through how we might improve upon that.”
According to Sharma’s department, the bill “will strengthen the government’s powers to scrutinize and intervene in takeovers and mergers to protect national security.”
Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chairman of Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, said it was essential to act.
“State-owned enterprises are going to go into this recession with deeper pockets than free market companies,” he said in an interview. “That’s going to turn many firms into easy pickings. Australia and even the European Union are tightening up foreign investment rules. That’s leaving the U.K. one of the few places where businesses are naked while everyone else is wearing armor.”

Some 72% of 47 economists expect the BOJ to keep policy unchanged at a two-day meeting ending June 16, according to a Bloomberg survey. While no major move is expected, half the analysts predict the central bank will enhance its loan support for companies in some form.
Since March, the bank has pledged unlimited purchases of government bonds, expanded its exchange-traded-fund buying and launched loan programs as part of measures worth almost $700 billion.
Click here to see full results.
The survey suggests the BOJ can now take a breather. Some 71% of the analysts said the bank has done enough or more than enough to cushion the economy. Some 95% said the pandemic is unlikely or very unlikely to push Japan into a financial crisis.
Among analysts expecting an expansion of the central bank’s loan support, many of them cited the planned enlargement of government lending linked to the BOJ’s program as a factor.
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and his BOJ colleagues meet next week as risk appetite returns to financial markets. The yen has weakened and the Nikkei 225 Stock Average has recovered to pre-virus levels amid gradual steps in Japan and other major economies to reopen from shutdowns.
“The BOJ will probably take no easing action this time,” said economist Shinichiro Kobayashi at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research & Consulting. “The BOJ has introduced a number of tools quickly and they’ll use this meeting to examine their impact.”
Japan Doubles Down to Deliver World’s ‘Biggest’ Stimulus Package
The Japanese government and the BOJ last month issued a rare joint statement pledging cooperation to protect the economy from the virus’s fallout. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has introduced about $2 trillion in stimulus measures and Kuroda has stressed that the BOJ will actively buy government bonds to keep yields down.
Some 54% of the BOJ watchers say the bank is essentially monetizing the country’s debt, the survey showed. Another 42% said that through the joint statement the bank had taken a step toward the outright funding of government operations.

1358,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 04:00PM ET</span>",What to look for in the Fed's U.S. economic outlook,"By Ann Saphir
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers on Wednesday will publish their first economic projections since the coronavirus pandemic set off a recession in February, estimates expected to signal a collapse in output this year and near-zero interest rates for the next few years.
They'll also give shape to the range of views at the U.S. central bank about the expected speed of the recovery and any longer-term damage to the world's biggest economy from a pandemic that has so far killed nearly 111,000 Americans https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-USA/0100B5K8423/index.html and prompted unprecedented restrictions on commerce and movement to slow its spread. 
Here is a guide to what the projections may show and what questions they may raise about the future of the U.S. economy as authorities lift those restrictions.
WHAT ARE THEY?
Every three months, each of the Fed's 17 policymakers develops a set of multi-year forecasts for U.S. unemployment, inflation, economic growth and interest rates. The projections are published in summary form at the end of the policy-setting meeting. The Fed did not release a quarterly summary of economic projections in March, however, because of massive uncertainty about the spread of the novel coronavirus, the resulting lockdowns, and the economic fallout. Though plenty is still uncertain, one thing is clear: the projections on Wednesday will be starkly worse than the Fed's largely favorable outlook in December. (Please see graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/2Xuo1Ei)
DOES THIS HAVE ALL THOSE DOTS?
Yes. The projections' centerpiece is the so-called dot plot, a graphic representation of where each unnamed policymaker sees interest rates in coming years. This collection of rate-setters' individual views has also occasionally functioned as a loose policy promise about the path of rates. This is one of those times. The Fed has signaled it will keep its key overnight lending rate near zero until the recovery is well underway. The dots, which will likely show most Fed policymakers expect no change in rates through 2022, ""could be seen as a soft way of reinforcing that guidance,"" said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JP Morgan. 
HOW DEEP, HOW LONG? 
With states in various stages of reopening after weeks or more of stay-at-home orders that precipitated the recession, the Fed policymakers' forecasts will map their sense of how quick the recovery will be. 
""The Fed likely forecasts a strong rebound in growth in H2, but the level of GDP will remain well below the pre-coronavirus level until late 2021"" Oxford Economics' Kathy Bostjancic wrote. Her view was widely echoed by other economists. 
The U.S. unemployment rate, which fell unexpectedly to 13.3% in May, may be projected to end this year in double digits and remaining well above healthy long-run levels next year. The Fed will likely project inflation to undershoot its 2% target for the foreseeable future, Bostjancic and others say.
Importantly, the Fed's summary of projections reflects what policymakers see as the most likely path for the economy, which for many does not factor in a second wave of infections - a key unknown for now. 
But deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, continue to increase in many U.S. states, and public health officials have flagged the possibility of further spread after crowded Memorial Day celebrations in parts of the country in late May and ongoing mass protests against racial inequalities since the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man, in police custody in Minneapolis.
""The risk to our forecast, and likely the Fed's, is skewed to the downside,"" Bostjancic said.
LONG-TERM DAMAGE?

The economic projections being released on Wednesday will also offer insight into whether Fed officials see the pandemic as inflicting permanent damage on the economy. Nomura economist Lewis Alexander projects little change to the Fed's earlier estimate that the economy can sustain about 1.9% yearly growth in the long run, along with 4.1% unemployment, though both could erode. More broadly, he said, ""it is important to emphasize the significant amount of uncertainty"" around the forecasts.

1359,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 02:36PM ET</span>",Wall Street Risk Analysts Rise in the Muni Bond Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Don’t be fooled by the market’s calm: these are hectic times for Wall Street’s municipal-bond analysts.
The $3.9 trillion state and local government debt market, typically the safest of havens, has suddenly become one where assessing risk matters again, thanks to the economic wreckage wrought by the pandemic.
Since the nation went virtually overnight from a record-setting expansion to the worst recession in decades, analysts at investment firms have been sifting through a wave of bond documents, disclosures and data from governments, city agencies, universities, hospitals, public transit authorities and nursing homes.
The challenge is to figure out what’s still a safe investment bet. That’s a difficult feat considering there’s no clear way to predict how it will keep affecting American life and the worst of the financial effects typically don’t show up until well after a contraction begins.
At DWS Group, an investment firm, six full-time municipal credit analysts are working closely with portfolio managers and traders there, attending two team calls a day to discuss trades and sector trends. “They’re busy,” said Ashton Goodfield, who leads the municipal department.
The municipal market, used by some 50,000 issuers, has gone through a period of unprecedented volatility. In March, investors pulled record amounts out of mutual funds, triggering a steep rout and moves by the Federal Reserve to stabilize the market. Since then, prices have essentially recovered, raising the possibility that the financial impacts of the slowdown have been too deeply discounted.
At Franklin Templeton, the firm’s new head of municipal debt investing, Ben Barber, is also focusing on risk analysis. The firm has more than a dozen credit analysts that have dedicated sector focuses like student housing and tobacco-settlement backed bonds. Tom Walsh leads the company’s municipal credit research effort.
Credit research is “very near and dear to my heart,” Barber said.
Barber started his career as an analyst covering the classic segment of the muni market, states and local governments. He said he still views municipalities positively despite their shutdown-related budget deficits, given that they have tools at their disposal like raising taxes.
The DWS research team has been looking for bonds at risk as well as those that are showing strength, Goodfield said. That way, she said, “if we want to sell something we think is showing weakness, we know where to go with that money, we know what to replace it with.”
Defaults have remained relatively rare compared with other markets, though they’ve started to rise. In a note to clients last week, Municipal Market Analytics said at least 29 borrowers became impaired in May, which includes defaults and steps like tapping reserves to avoid them. That’s the most since December 2014, according to MMA.
Goodfield said that it’s hard to generalize both positively or negatively about the plethora of industries that tap the muni market. For the most part, though, the firm is cautious on high-yield deals that were sold for ventures that seek to make novel products from waste. One such deal for a California project to turn rice waste into fiberboard skipped bond payments in June.
Issuers have been uploading so-called continuing disclosures online that give details to investors on how their business is faring. The volume of those rose nearly 13% in the week ended June 7, according to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.
The increase of information is welcome in a market where issuers are notoriously slow to post financial updates.
Yet some of the filings are more detailed than others. Take Foley, Alabama, which included a big caveat for bond analysts: “This information is subject to change without notice.”

EIA projected total U.S. power demand will drop to 3,675 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2020 from 3,896 billion kWh in 2019 before rising to 3,711 billion kWh in 2021.
That compares with an all-time high of 4,003 billion kWh in 2018, according to federal data going back to 1949.
If power consumption falls as expected in 2020, it would be the first time since 2012 that total demand declines for two consecutive years.
EIA said natural gas' share of generation will rise from 37% in 2019 to 41% in 2020 before dropping to 36% in 2021 as gas prices increase, while coal's share will slide from 24% in 2019 to 17% in 2020 before rising to 20% in 2021.
Nuclear's share of generation will rise from 20% in 2019 to 22% in 2020 before slipping to 21% in 2021, while renewables will rise from 17% in 2019 to 21% in 2020 and 23% in 2021. Both nuclear and renewables will top coal for the first time in 2020.
EIA projected power sales to commercial and industrial consumers will drop by 9.1% and 6.7%, respectively, in 2020 from 2019.
Electricity sales to the residential sector will only decline about 1.5% in 2020 from 2019 as mild weather reduces heating and air conditioning use even though many people are staying home to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
While both the residential and commercial sectors consumed record amounts of electricity in 2018 at 1,469 billion kWh and 1,382 billion kWh, respectively, the industrial sector set its all-time high of 1,064 billion kWh in 2000.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union finance ministers reviewed the EU's 750 billion euro plan for post-pandemic recovery on Tuesday ahead of what will be fractious negotiations over who should get the cash and even over the legality of borrowing to offer grants.
The European Commission's recovery plan aims to help economically weaker countries hit worst by the coronavirus to recover at a more equal pace with the stronger ones, to preserve the unity of the EU's single market of 450 million people.
""The aim (on Tuesday) is really to have a first exchange of views, it is too early for any big fight,"" one EU official said.
A second official added: ""It's the first round, everyone talks but there is no negotiation. It is good to feel the atmosphere, but nobody will move. It is too soon.""
The stimulus plan, backed by France and Germany, is to be deployed over the next four years and help the EU shift to being climate neutral by 2050 and better adapted to the digital age.
But, controversially, it entails the Commission borrowing on the market against the security of the EU budget and then giving, rather than lending, some of the money to needy states.
This, according to Finland, the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark and Sweden, could violate the principle that the EU cannot incur debt and that its EU budget cannot run a deficit.
Some also argue that, since all countries can borrow cheaply on the market, there is no need for EU grants at all. Cheap loans would be enough, they say. 
Yet the Commission proposed 500 billion euros in grants and 250 billion euros in loans, so that highly indebted countries such as Italy and Greece would not have to borrow even more.
It also proposed the money be allocated based on population size, GDP per capita and past average unemployment levels.
Such criteria put Italy and Spain at the top of the list.
But they also benefit Greece, which survived the pandemic with far fewer infections and deaths than, say, Belgium, but would receive almost six times more money.
Poland would be the third biggest beneficiary after Italy and Spain, yet it too suffered relatively little from the pandemic and is forecast by the Commission to have the smallest recession of all EU countries this year.
The Netherlands says the distribution of cash must reflect the actual impact of the coronavirus.

The plan has to win the approval of all EU governments and parliaments and officials expect negotiations to drag into July and possibly later.

“Although there remain differences between various nations that are not small, I have the impression that everyone has the will to reach an agreement within a short time,” German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said in a statement on Tuesday. “The starting positions are different, but as I said, a constructive spirit can be detected on all sides.”
Scholz spoke before he and his 26 EU counterparts debate for the first time a plan by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, that would make as much as 500 billion euros in grants and 250 billion euros in concessional loans available to the member states most affected by a pandemic-induced recession. The program, which needs to win the backing of every capital, would be funded by joint debt issuance in a significant step toward closer economic integration.
While EU leaders have agreed on the need for a fund to assist with the recovery and accept the proposal as a basis from which to start discussions, disagreements over key aspects of the plan loom large. Several countries have already raised issues with the blueprint, signaling heated negotiations in the weeks ahead as they seek to find common ground.
Governments including Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden have all voiced opposition and are keen to ensure their taxpayers aren’t on the hook for future repayments.
In a letter to parliament, the Dutch government said the recovery fund’s size and distribution must be based on the actual impact of the coronavirus crisis. “It should be limited in time and financed on a loans-for-loans basis based on a clear repayment schedule,” the government said, adding that it’s “skeptical” of the commission’s proposal.
Austrian Finance Minister Gernot Bluemel said that while he supports the idea of a European recovery fund for targeted, one-time emergency support, his country would withhold approval until its size has been pared back and repayment details were made explicit.
“The overall package isn’t acceptable in its current form, both regarding its size and its content,” Bluemel said in a statement. He added that the proposal doesn’t say how the funds will be repaid, is based too much on non-repayable grants rather than loans, and doesn’t sufficiently tie them to conditions.
Bluemel and his counterparts from Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands held a conference call with Scholz on Monday to explain their opposition. Scholz, when asked how the conversation went, said, “there were a lot of constructive signals.”
Grants, Loans
Among the key points of contention are the size of the fund as well as the mix between grants and loans. The plan’s main opponents prefer fewer grants and more loans and want to ensure sufficient strings are attached to the available funds. Another issue has to do with the criteria based on which aid will be allocated to different countries, something governments are expected to fight over in coming weeks.
“What’s most important is that when we look closer at it, much of the support in the recovery and resilience fund isn’t going to countries that are truly affected by the pandemic”, Swedish Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson said in an interview.
Another issue hawkish countries have brought up is bringing forward the repayment date for the funds the commission plans to raise on the markets to finance this effort. They would prefer an earlier date than the proposal’s 2028.
Denmark has already made indications that it’s softening its stance, with the government no longer opposing direct handouts, but now seeking to reduce the “subsidy element” of the fund, according to Danish broadcaster DR.
“It’s about us supporting nations with allocations of funds for very specific investments and helping them through an economic recovery,” Scholz said. “It’s very important for us that the funds are used to drive an economic recovery.”

1364,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 12:55PM ET</span>","Brazil central bank watching FX, commodities impact on inflation","By Jamie McGeever and Marcela Ayres
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Short-term asset price moves such as the recent rebound across markets will not influence Brazilian monetary policy, central bank director Fabio Kanczuk said on Tuesday, but policymakers are watching how the exchange rate and commodities feed into inflation expectations.
Speaking in an online live event hosted by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Kanczuk said the effect on inflation from exchange rate and commodity price changes has never disappeared, and that close attention must be paid to the recent moves in both. 
After slumping more than 30% this year to a record low of almost 6.00 per dollar in May, Brazil's real has rallied some 20% to push through 5.00 per dollar. Commodities such as oil and metals, denominated in dollars, have also rebounded strongly.
Brazil's benchmark IPCA consumer price inflation is currently running at 2.40%, well below the central bank's 2020 target of 4.00%. As the economy tips into a steep coronavirus-fueled decline, inflation is expected to fall even further.
Kanczuk said the country's large output gap is pushing inflation lower, but absent that, the rising neutral rate of interest would be pulling inflation in the opposite direction. 
He also noted that Brazil's weak fiscal position could embed a level of risk premium into inflation expectations, which would point toward higher interest rates than otherwise might be the case.
The central bank will announce its latest interest rate decision next week. Economists expect it to lower the benchmark Selic rate to a new low, the only question being whether it is by 50 basis points to 2.50% or by 75 bps to 2.25%.

Kanczuk repeated the line, shared recently by central bank President Roberto Campos Neto, that any bond buying will be done not for the monetary policy aim of lowering long-term borrowing costs but to smooth out any market dysfunction.

They complained about 2011 rules that stipulated packaging be dominated by health warnings with the brand written in a standard font in a plain section devoid of trade marks.
Other countries, including Britain, France, New Zealand and Uruguay, have since put in place similar rules.
The complainants argued that Australia's Tobacco Plain Packaging (NYSE:PKG) Act constituted an unjustified barrier to trade, but the panel found Australia's measures were not more restrictive than was necessary to achieve the public health goal of reducing smoking.
Honduras and the Dominican Republic appealed against the panel's findings.
The Appellate Body said on Tuesday that it had found no errors in the earlier panel's conclusions and that it rejected the complainants' request for Australia to change its packaging rules.
Tuesday's ruling was the last by the WTO's Appellate Body, which serves as a supreme court in international trade disputes, but has ceased to function after the United States blocked new appointments. The result is that the Geneva-based WTO can no longer effectively intervene to settle disputes.

1366,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 12:09PM ET</span>","U.S. Job Market Rapidly Healing in June, Fed Researchers Say","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. labor market has continued to heal at a relatively rapid rate through early June, St. Louis Federal Reserve researchers found, using real-time data that provides a more timely view than official government reports.
Employment has fallen about 8.75% in the week ended June 5 from January levels, making up almost half the decline of 15.08% recorded in mid-April, St. Louis Fed senior economist Maximiliano Dvorkin and research assistant Asha Bharadwaj wrote in a blog posted Tuesday. The estimates rely on daily employment data from Homebase, a scheduling and time-tracking tool mainly used by individually owned and operated businesses in the food and beverage, retail and service industries.
“We predict that the recovery has continued at a healthy pace” through June, the researchers said.
May unemployment unexpectedly declined to 13.3% as employers added 2.5 million workers to payroll, defying expectations for a Depression-style surge in joblessness and stoking optimism the economy is bouncing back from a virus-induced recession. The St. Louis Fed estimates show states are recovering at sharply varying rates as they slowly reopen after shuttering in March to limit the spread of Covid-19.
For example, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee had all seen employment declines from January of less than 6% by early June, while New York, which has been a center of the outbreak, had a 14% decrease.
The blog was published as the Federal Open Market Committee began a two-day meeting to discuss the economic outlook and decide on the next steps for monetary policy to bolster the recovery.

1367,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>",Pakistan's budget to target 2.3% growth after pandemic hit,"By Asif Shahzad
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan will target growth of 2.3% in fiscal year 2020-21, according to government officials and documents seen by Reuters that said the economic landscape would depend mainly on the country's ability to control the coronavirus pandemic.
Prime Minister Imran Khan's government is set to present its 2020-21 budget on Friday, in a parliamentary session that only 25% of lawmakers will attend due to pandemic restrictions.
""The GDP growth for 2020-21 is targeted at 2.3 percent with contributions from agriculture (2.9 percent), industry (0.1 percent) and services (2.8 percent),"" a planning commission working paper seen by Reuters said.
That forecast is much rosier than the 0.2% contraction in 2020-21 projected by the World Bank earlier in June. The multilateral lender sees growth of -2.6% this fiscal year, ending June 30, while the government expects a 0.4% contraction.
A recent surge in COVID-19 cases has made economists sceptical about a quick recovery in the South Asian nation. Khan said on Monday that the outbreak was not expected to hit its peak until July or August.
The planning commission paper projects an average inflation rate of 6.5% in 2020-21, a trade deficit of 7.1% of GDP and a current account deficit of 1.6% of GDP. Exports and imports are projected to grow at 1.5% and 1.1%, respectively.
Inflation hit a decade-high of 14.56% in January.
BUDGET OUTLAY
A budget strategy paper in March, just before the pandemic hit, had projected growth of 3% in 2020-21.
The paper, seen by Reuters, foresaw spending of 7.6 trillion Pakistani rupees ($46.76 billion) and a fiscal deficit of 6.9% of GDP -- much lower than a current finance ministry projection of over 9% for 2019-20.
Of that, 3.235 trillion Pakistani rupees ($19.90 billion) was earmarked for debt servicing and 1.402 trillion Pakistani rupees ($8.63 billion) for defence -- a rise of over 12% from last year.
The March paper projected public sector development spending of 700-900 billion rupees, compared with 650 billion rupees ($4 billion) in the newer planning commission paper.
Officials say the numbers from March's strategy paper could be tweaked slightly, although the total outlay is likely to be similar.
The National Economic Council (NEC) will review the estimates ahead of Friday's budget and can make changes.
HISTORICAL BORROWING
Hit hard by the coronavirus and with about $10 billion in debt service costs in the coming financial year, Pakistan needs funds to stave off a balance of payments crisis, officials from the finance and economic affair division told Reuters.
""We have plans to mobilise around $14 billion in inflows,"" one of the high-ranking officials said -- more than Pakistan has borrowed in a single-year before.
That includes $6 billion from multilateral banks, $2 billion from last year's IMF bailout package, $3 billion in Chinese commercial loan rollovers, $1.5 billion from Eurobonds, and the rest in bilateral aid and Saudi oil repayment facilitation.
The International Monetary Fund money is subject to a successful review, he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The initial shock of the coronavirus pandemic to Britain's financial system is over, but another sharp repricing of risk is still possible, Bank of England Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe said on Tuesday.
""The COVID crisis is very far from over. The depth and length of its economic impact remain very uncertain. It is clear that there is likely to be a great deal of pain for the financial sector,"" Cunliffe said.
""However, the first phase - the initial shock and adjustment to a far more challenging economic outlook in the near term - has passed,"" he added at an event hosted by the Investment Association, a fund management trade body.
Cunliffe said recent economic data pointed to some recovery in April and May, but it was early days and that he still thought the central bank's most recent scenario of an unprecedented fall in output this year looked reasonable.
Negative interest rates remained under review at the BoE, but views on their effectiveness were mixed and the central bank would need to take into account the damage they could do to lenders' business models, he added.
Financial markets saw bouts of extreme volatility in March as countries went into lockdown to fight the pandemic, shuttering businesses and paving the way to what is expected to be the worst economic contraction in Britain in 300 years.
Cunliffe said banks had been able to absorb a very severe market shock and this should not be put at risk by weakening their regulation.
Policymakers needed to look at ways to reduce surges in demand for liquidity and improve the supply of liquidity under stress, he added.
Some open-ended property funds remain suspended since the market volatility.
""We should look at the costs and benefits of having more liquidity resilience in the system,"" he said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan confirmed on Tuesday that he was considering a bid to become the next director-general of the World Trade Organization, as EU governments debated whether to unify around a single European candidate.
The nominations process began on Monday and will run to July 8 to find a successor to Brazilian Roberto Azevedo, who will vacate the post a year early at the end of August.
""Certainly I am exploring the option of being a candidate for the director-general of the WTO,"" Hogan, an Irishman who has been trade commissioner since November, told a video news conference after a meeting with EU ministers responsible for trade. 
""I think there is an important amount of work to be done to reform the organization, to make it more effective and efficient, but also to deal with many of the trade issues that are bedeviling the international community now arising from COVID-19,"" he said.
Hogan said he had discussed the succession issue some time ago with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who he said was ""very much of the view"" that the next WTO chief should be from a developed country.
Croatia, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union until the end of June, said EU ministers had agreed the future director-general should be a strong political figure with the ability to broker compromises.
Croatian Foreign Minister Gordan Grlic-Radman said EU countries would discuss whether to unify around a single EU candidate in the coming month.
However, Dutch Trade Minister Sigrid Kaag said the Netherlands and some countries believed the EU should not rule out supporting candidates from like-minded non-EU countries.

French Trade Minister Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne said ministers had agreed to be united on the issue and that this could mean supporting a non-EU candidate.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub is important not only to China but the rest of the world, a senior IMF official said on Tuesday as the Chinese territory faced renewed pro-democracy unrest.
""Hong Kong is underpinned by a very strong financial sector...and a monetary system that is anchored to rules, and well governed and well understood by the world,"" International Monetary Fund First Deputy Managing Director Geoffrey Okamoto said at a roundtable teleconference.
""Hong Kong is important not just to China but to the rest of world. We want to retain Hong Kong's (status) as a financial hub,"" he said, adding that the IMF expected to issue a revised update to its world economic outlook on June 24.
China's parliament has recently approved a decision to go forward with national security legislation for Hong Kong that democracy activists, diplomats and some in the business world fear will jeopardise its semi-autonomous status and role as an international financial centre.
Okamoto spoke as hundreds of protesters gathered in Hong Kong's city centre to mark a year of sustained pro-democracy rallies amid fears of renewed unrest over the national security legislation.
The coronavirus pandemic has pushed economies around the globe to the verge of deep recession, forcing the IMF to cut its world economic forecasts.
Okamoto said that while the immediate response should be to deploy all necessary tools to protect lives and jobs, policy support needed to shift when countries end lockdown measures imposed to contain the pandemic.
""The reopening of economies...and a return to a growth phase will require different policies. Removing some policy support (may be necessary) because keeping them in place could have more distorting effects,"" he said, without elaborating.
Asian economies have deployed extraordinary fiscal and monetary measures to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic.

Some countries with huge overseas borrowing have suffered from massive capital outflows in March, though market volatility has subsided since then.

BUENOS AIRES/LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Argentina's debt restructuring talks are sparking hopes and tension, with the government and its creditors in a sensitive final stretch to strike a breakthrough deal to revamp around $65 billion in sovereign bonds the country cannot pay.
The government is preparing an amended proposal to creditors that would for a second time sweeten an original offer made in April. For their part, creditors have warily eased their demands to bring the sides closer together.
A source told Reuters on Monday that the government would unveil the sweetened offer late this week.
Argentina's bonds, which slumped last year into distressed territory, have been rising over the last month as talks have progressed, despite a gap remaining between what Argentina is willing to pay and what key creditor groups want.
""Overall, we think Argentine bonds have further room to rally,"" Carlos de Sousa at Oxford Economic wrote in a note on Tuesday, adding the offer should be improved in coming days.
Ahead of a moving June 12 deadline for the talks, however, tensions are stirring beneath the surface as negotiators on both sides push for the best deal possible. The deadline is expected to be extended.
One bondholder source familiar with the discussions criticized Argentina's Economy Minister Martin Guzman as trying to exclude some people from the negotiating table.
The person, who asked not be named, said the two largest bondholder groups including names like BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Fidelity and Ashmore, were ""united"" in refuting this behavior and that the ""gamesmanship is risking derailing the process.""
An economy ministry source said investors alone were responsible for who was at the negotiation table.

Alejandro Hardziej at Pala Asset Management said the firm had recently sold half its Argentine holdings as it saw limited further upside, but added that ""there will be an agreement sooner or later - the difference between the parties is just too small.""

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The European Union's 750 billion-euro stimulus plan to cushion the economic slump expected this year due to coronavirus lockdowns is unfair towards Hungary, Finance Minister Mihaly Varga said on Tuesday.
Under the plan, which must be approved by all bloc members, the EU's executive Commission would borrow from the market and disburse two-thirds of the funds in grants and the rest in loans with much of the money going to hard-hit Italy and Spain.
""In its present form, the economic rescue plan is unfair towards Hungary, as in essence it has been tailor-made to help southern member states,"" Varga said in a video on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
Varga said the EU should adopt a ""fair and proportionate"" plan to alleviate the economic damage caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Leaders of Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia - the so-called Visegrad group -- will meet on Thursday to discuss the plan.
Varga said the EU should adopt a ""fair and proportionate"" approach when it comes to alleviating the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.

He said the plan should take into account the fact that the recovery could put extra burden on smaller, less developed economies like Hungary which has a tight fiscal policy.

DUBLIN/LONDON (Reuters) - Ireland attracted record high demand on Tuesday for a 10-year bond issue that was set to raise 6 billion euros ($6.7 billion), closing in on its funding target to shore up government finances after the coronavirus pandemic.
The issue drew almost 70 billion euros of demand, more than twice the previous record for an Irish sovereign bond.
Euro zone peers Greece and Spain also drew strong demand for bond sales on Tuesday, as very generous central bank stimulus measures, including from the ECB last week, and an EU recovery fund, have boosted appetite for non-core euro zone debt. 
Ireland has stressed that the coronavirus-related economic collapse is different to its last financial crisis a decade ago and that it can borrow its way out of trouble, whereas in 2010 it needed an EU/IMF bailout when funding became too expensive.
The eye-watering demand seen for Tuesday's debt issue, exceeding a record 33 billion euros seen for a seven-year syndicated sale in April, enabled Ireland's debt agency to set the spread at 30 basis points over the mid-swap level, a lead manager on the deal said.
The issue, the Irish debt agency's third via a syndicate of banks so far this year - another unprecedented move - was set to increase its total bond sales since January to 18.5 billion euros, meaning it has already almost reached its target range for the year of 20 billion-24 billion euros.
The goal was revised up in April from 10 billion-14 billion euros to fund extra spending and make up for lost tax revenue from the shutdown of the economy, which is now being unwound at a slower pace than much of Europe.
Ireland expects the disruption to turn a budget surplus last year into a deficit of between 7.4% and 10% of gross domestic product this year. Data last week showed the tax intake was unexpectedly stable by the end of May, mainly thanks to bumper corporate tax returns. 
Ireland mandated  Barclays  (LON:BARC), BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), Danske Bank, Davy, NatWest Markets and Nomura to sell the bond.

LONDON (Reuters) - The United Kingdom told the European Union on Tuesday to speed up negotiations on a Brexit free trade deal, cautioning that there was no point in having an 11th-hour agreement that would cause havoc for businesses and citizens.
Britain left the EU on Jan. 31 but the main terms of its membership remain in place during a transition period until the end of this year, in which time both sides hope to negotiate a new free trade deal.
""There is no point in us arriving at an agreement at the 11th hour: we have to arrive at agreement to enable it to be implemented, ratified but also for our citizens and businesses to prepare,"" Paymaster General Penny Mordaunt told parliament. 
""That is what is dictating the timetable here and that is why we must have renewed focus. We're talking to the EU about having a change of format, about how we can increase the pace of negotiations, get the focus where we need it to be, and get a deal done for both of our sakes.""
Mordaunt, a deputy to Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, said there had been no movement on key sticking points in recent rounds and so talks would have to accelerate.
""There was however no movement on the most difficult areas where differences of principle are most acute, notably fisheries, governance arrangements and the so called level playing field,"" she added.
""To make progress, we need to accelerate and intensify our work,"" she said, adding under questioning that there were differences over the 2019 Political Declaration, which sets out the direction of future negotiations.

""The political declaration is not a treaty, there will be differences on both sides to interpretation and the point that we have emphasised in the last few days is that the EU cannot be the referee in that,"" Mordaunt said.

The memo, sent to employees on Friday and seen by Reuters, underscores the cautious approach by Germany's top lender as some global competitors loosen restrictions.
Germany's largest bank, which has been encouraging employees to continue to work from home when possible, told staff that strict hygiene rules remain in place. Non-essential travel is still verboten and even private travel is risky, the memo said.

TBILISI (Reuters) - The World Bank has cut its 2020 economic growth forecasts for Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia due to the coronavirus pandemic, but it expects the three South Caucasus nations to recover next year.
""Growth in the South Caucasus is projected to decelerate to -3.1% this year as the subregion faces growth headwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic and, subsequently, low commodity prices,"" the World Bank said in a global economic prospects report.
Growth is projected to pick up to 3% in 2021, it said, as the impact of shocks related to the pandemic dissipates and tourism recovers alongside improving consumer and business confidence in Armenia and Georgia.
""Activity is expected to firm in Azerbaijan in 2021 as oil prices stabilise, but the overall recovery will be muted by lingering structural rigidities,"" it said.
Georgia's gross domestic product (GDP) growth is expected to fall by 4.8% in 2020 before rebounding to around 4% in 2021, the World Bank said.
The Georgian government has also revised its economic outlook forecast to -4% this year from a previous growth projection of 4.5%.
Georgia's economy contracted by 3.6% year-on-year in the first four months of 2020, compared with 4.8% growth in the same period of 2019, as measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus took their toll.
The World Bank forecast Armenia's economy would shrink by 2.8% in 2020 and then expand by 4.9% in 2021.
The Armenian government expects a contraction of 2%, down from an earlier projection of 4.9% growth.
GDP in oil-rich Azerbaijan is expected to contract by 2.6% in 2020, partly due to weaker crude prices, but should rebound by 2.2% next year, said the World Bank, which had previously predicted Azerbaijan's growth would be 2.3% in 2020.

1382,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 08:37AM ET</span>",Singapore's migrant workers fear financial ruin after virus ordeal,"By John Geddie, Joe Brock and Koustav Samanta
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - As Sharif Uddin contemplates leaving the cramped Singapore dormitory where he has spent weeks under coronavirus quarantine, fears about his future creep in.
The 42-year-old Bangladeshi construction supervisor is one of thousands of low-income migrant workers trapped in packed bunk rooms that have been ravaged by the coronavirus, accounting for more than 90% of Singapore's 38,000 infections.
As Singapore began easing its lockdown measures this month, migrants like Uddin started to think about returning to the outside world, and whether a job would be available for him to help pay off his debts as Singapore braces for its deepest ever recession.
""The fear of losing jobs is worrying everyone at the moment,"" said Uddin, who sends the bulk of his wages to his family in Bangladesh and is still repaying loans taken to pay off his recruitment agent, like many of the South Asian migrant workers in Singapore.
For Singapore, the system of cheap, imported labour to do jobs in the construction, shipping, manufacturing and service industries works effectively. When times are good, it means jobs that locals usually shun can be filled, but when the economy is weak, it is easy to cut back on foreign workers.
That leaves migrant workers like Uddin vulnerable and at real risk of being forced to return to their home country where employment opportunities are scarce. In interviews with more than a dozen workers in Singapore, many said while they were still being paid, they feared they would lose their jobs when the quarantine is lifted.
Uddin said Singapore was his ""dream city"" when he first arrived in 2008, but like many migrants he found most of his toil went towards paying family expenses and creditors, meaning he saved very little.
He has worked on building Singapore's subway, says he writes poetry and hopes to one day open a bookshop back in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka. But already on his fourth job, he is still many years away from saving the money he needs. 
""The dreams of migrants ... don't get fulfilled very soon. It takes really long to chase them,"" Uddin said.
""As years pass – one year, two years, those initial big dreams and aspirations slowly start fading away.""
The Singapore government has waived foreign worker levies for companies to try and ensure migrants get paid while under quarantine and introduced measures to help laid off workers find new positions without having to first travel back to their home country, a core complaint of many labourers.
DEBT TRAPS
Lawrence Wong, the co-head of Singapore's virus taskforce, told Reuters the government's waiving of levies and other steps have helped alleviate ""major concerns"" of workers around job security, but added that layoffs were possible given the grim economic outlook. 
""The contractor may have a project today, but down the road will they still have projects? That depends on the economy. So many uncertain factors when it comes to job security,"" said Wong, who is also the minister for national development.
He added that some workers may remain quarantined in their dormitories until August, or possibly beyond, as the government completes mass testing. 
The pandemic has drawn attention to the stark inequalities in the modern city-state where more than 300,000 labourers from Bangladesh, India and China often live in rooms for 12 to 20 men, working jobs that pay as little as S$20 ($14.30) a day.
That is higher than they would make at home. But the median salary for Singaporean employees in 2019 was S$4,563 per month, according to the manpower ministry. 
The bigger worry for many migrants like Uddin is the debts they have racked up securing jobs in Singapore.
Migrants will usually be charged S$7,000-10,000 in fees by a recruitment agent in their home country, equivalent to more than a year of their basic salary, according to rights groups. If they lose their job, this debt could haunt their families for years.
""If there were no recruitment fees, that would solve almost all of these problems,"" said Deborah Fordyce, president of Singapore NGO Transient Workers Count Too.
""Recruitment costs are what keep them in debt.""
DREAMS SOUR
Wong, the minister, said the government will continue to work to improve migrants' lives in Singapore, but tackling issues like fees is difficult because many agents operate in the workers' home countries outside the city-state's jurisdiction.
Singapore's government has pledged to improve living conditions for migrant workers in the short-term and build new, higher-spec dormitories over the coming years. 
Ali Nur Khan, a 25-year-old Bangladeshi construction worker, said when he first got a job in Singapore, he felt like he had ""won the lottery"", but as the debts stacked up, and the low salary and basic living conditions hit home, his enthusiasm quickly faded. He said he has never called his family from his dormitory room because he is embarrassed.
""Singapore was my dream country. But it was like a nightmare when I saw the dirty, crowded living place,"" he said.
Now, Khan said, ""there is huge uncertainty. Nobody knows what is waiting for us"". 
Singapore's ruling People's Action Party, which is months away from an election it is likely to win comfortably, also has to balance the needs of migrants with those of locals who are looking for financial support during an economic crisis.
A 2019 U.N. study found that 60% of Singaporeans thought migrant workers should not receive the same pay and benefits as locals. There have been backlashes about rising numbers of foreign workers in the city-state, such as opposition to the building of dormitories near residential areas.
The percentage of foreign workers in Singapore's total labour force has risen from 3% in the 1970s to 38% today, according to data from Migration Policy Institute and the government.
Some foreign labourers who come in search of a better life in Singapore leave feeling marginalised and disappointed, especially given the time they have sacrificed away from their families.
On his tenth birthday last year, Uddin said his son reminded him that they had only spent seven months of his life together.

""It hurts both of us the same way and I can't do anything about it,"" he said.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish property prices grew at their lowest rate for five years during the first quarter of 2020, the National Statistics Institute said on Tuesday, as the coronavirus outbreak dampened demand across the sector except for new-builds.
Spain's property price index rose by 3.2% in the first quarter compared with the same period in 2019 - its lowest increase since 2015, when the country began a slow recovery from the deep economic crisis of 2008.
Second-hand property prices rose 2.7% year-on-year, also the smallest increase since 2015. 
But prices for new-build properties, typically favoured by big investors, grew 6.1% year-on-year, up from 5.3% the previous quarter, suggesting demand among institutional buyers remained buoyant despite Spain's stringent lockdown.
Measures to curb the coronavirus prevented individuals - who tend to buy second-hand homes - from visiting properties, taking out mortgages, and using public notaries.
Spain's real estate market had already showed signs of a slowdown in late 2019, with prices dropping 1.3% year-on-year for the first time in three years, according to the country's second-largest property portal, Fotocasa.
""The moderation in prices will continue during 2020 as a consequence of the domestic and global macroeconomic context,"" said Fotocasa communications director Anais Lopez. ""It's possible we'll see the first outright falls in property prices.""
Fotocasa's price index for the first five months of this year showed falls ranging from 1.1% last month to 2.9% in March, when Spain declared a state of emergency which halted most activity.

Spain suffered one of the world's worst coronavirus outbreaks, with over 241,000 cases and 27,000 deaths so far. The economy, which relies heavily on tourism and real estate, contracted 5.2% in the first quarter.

The United Kingdom and the European Union agreed the 31-page Political Declaration, which sets out the direction of future negotiations, in October 2019. It is not legally binding.
""The political declaration is not a treaty, there will be differences on both sides to interpretation and the point that we have emphasised in the last few days is that the EU cannot be the referee in that,"" Paymaster General Penny Mordaunt told parliament.
Asked about a German constituational court ruling, Mordaunt said it emphasised that the United Kingdom was a sovereign nation and as soon as the EU accepted that then progress could be made in talks on a Brexit free trade deal.

""The German Constitutional Court decision does again emphasise the point that we are a sovereign equal and the EU needs to accept that and its decision will obviously have implications for the EU to consider,"" she said.

1386,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 08:25AM ET</span>","Number of Austrian job-seekers falls below 500,000","VIENNA (Reuters) - The number of Austrian job-seekers has fallen below half a million for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic pushed unemployment to the highest level recorded since World War Two, Labour Minister Christine Aschbacher said on Tuesday.
The government has taken to reporting unemployment figures weekly rather than monthly. Unemployment stood at 11.5% at the end of May by a national measure, having eased from a peak above 12% in mid-April as the country's lockdown was loosened.
A week after that data was reported it has fallen further, Aschbacher said. The number of job-seekers fell to 492,616, of whom 447,143 were registered as unemployed and the rest were in training. At the end of May there were 517,221 job-seekers.
""For the first time since the corona crisis, we have fewer than 500,000 people looking for work in Austria,"" Aschbacher told a news conference.
Aschbacher did not specify where the unemployment rate now stood, but said the number of people in the so-called kurzarbeit layoff prevention scheme had also fallen.
""We see overall that the curve of employees in kurzarbeit is flattening, the companies are moving out of kurzarbeit step by step and towards more and full employment, and more and more companies are able to switch to normal operations,"" she said.
The kurzarbeit scheme enables companies to keep staff on their books and only pay for hours actually worked, with the state topping that up to 80%-90% of the normal net salary.
The number of people registered for that scheme had fallen to 1,161,045 from 1,371,338 at the end of May. Aschbacher said last week that many people would be moving out of the scheme at the end of the month.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel's main coastal city has returned to work - and play - but the coronavirus pandemic has brought new challenges that will weigh heavily on Tel Aviv's restaurants, bars and other businesses emerging from lockdown.
Although Israel has escaped the pandemic relatively lightly so far, with 298 deaths and 18,000 cases, its tourist-reliant economy took a big hit after going into lockdown in mid-March, contracting an annual 7.1% in the first quarter.
More than 300,000 people have returned to work since Israel began lifting restrictions last month, but airports are still closed to foreign visitors. 
And Tel Aviv - Israel's commercial and entertainment capital - is experiencing the kind of problems that businesses the world over are having to deal with.
Some sectors have not yet re-emerged from lockdown and others are adapting to new rules and red tape, including insisting face masks be worn, providing hand sanitizer and thermometers and spacing tables further apart in restaurants. 
""Regular business flow is still not back to normal because there are still people who are scared,"" said Ben Rachmani, of the Four Sixteen vegan restaurant/bar.
Evening trade was ""very solid"" but lunchtime ""messed up"" because many former customers are still working from home.
Rachmani said he had to re-open because he would only have been able to survive a few months of delivering takeaways and not paying rent.
""If it had gone on until September or October, I would have been done,"" he said.
Some said that the May 27 re-opening had come too soon. On Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country would stop easing restrictions after a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases.
He urged the public to keep social distancing and wear face masks - guidelines that some Israelis, including in Tel Aviv, had been ignoring as they sought to return to normality.
Others have remained cautious.
In the Dizengoff Street shopping area, Avi Amir said his hairdressing store lost 40% of its business because older clients were staying home, and fewer customers can be in the store at once.
In the last week, Amir said, he received four fines totalling $1,100 from municipal inspectors who said staff were not wearing plastic face shields.
However, for one woman entrepreneur, the coronavirus crisis has forced her to try something new. After losing her hotel job, Victoria Janitsky took advantage of lower rents in a prime location to open a nail salon.

""To open a new business is a hard thing, so it's just another hard procedure,"" she said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - S&P Global Ratings on Tuesday lowered its outlook on Japan's sovereign debt rating to stable from positive, citing increased uncertainty over the country's fiscal health as it boosts spending to overcome the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
The move underscores the challenge Japan faces in trying to support an economy already slipping into recession, without losing control of its tattered finances. Its public debt is among the highest in industrialised nations.
""Japan's weak government finances have deteriorated further in fiscal 2020 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" S&P said. Two supplementary budgets rolled out by the government will raise the general government deficit for this fiscal year to about 16% of the country's gross domestic product, it said.
""The fiscal position should improve materially once the outbreak recedes and economic growth returns. Nevertheless, we expect the fiscal deficit will remain relatively high"" in fiscal 2021 through 2023, it said.
S&P affirmed Japan's A+ long-term and A-1 short-term sovereign credit ratings. But it said it could lower the ratings if economic growth remains persistently low and a possible return to deflation puts long-term pressure on Japan's fiscal performance.
Massive asset purchases by the Bank of Japan, which already holds over 40% of outstanding Japanese government bonds, is likely to keep the government's debt-servicing costs low, S&P said.
""However, should real interest rates increase sharply at some point, this would severely strain the government's debt dynamics,"" it said.
""This could occur if investors demand a higher risk premium and push up nominal interest rates. But we believe the greater risk is from renewed and persistent deflation.""

Japan has introduced two stimulus packages worth a combined $2.2 trillion to cushion the blow from the coronavirus pandemic, which is set to add to the country's already huge debt, which is twice the size of its economy.

1390,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Tuesday, June 9th","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com -- The U.S. is in recession, the World Bank predicts a hefty 5.2% hit to global output in 2020 and yet the Nasdaq is at an all-time high. Crude oil is expected to give back some of its recent gains, while the IPO market is set to welcome  Vroom  in a busy week. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, June 9th.
1. U.S. is in recession - official
The economic downturn in the U.S. triggered by the social distancing measures adopted to combat the Covid-19 virus has been officially declared a recession, which started in February - bringing to an end the longest period of economic expansion in U.S. history.
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the body which acts as the arbiter for determining U.S. business cycles, said late Monday ""the unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warrants the designation of this episode as a recession, even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions."" 
The designation has not come as a surprise, after all U.S. gross domestic product fell 4.8% annualized in the first three months of the year and the next quarter is expected to be much worse. At the same time, the unemployment rate rose from a record low of 3.5% in February, hitting 14.7% in April and 13.3% last month.
This puts the spotlight on the two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve, concluding Wednesday, for signs of more stimulus ahead.
2. Global output faces 5.2% coronavirus hit in 2020
The Covid-19 outbreak may be past its peak. New York City, regarded as the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., started the slow process of reopening for business on Monday. 
But it’s important not to forget the damage caused, with over seven million having been infected and more than 400,000 dead to date.
And there’s also the economic impact.
Global economic output is set to contract by 5.2% in 2020 due to the coronavirus, the World Bank said on Monday, in its latest Global Economic Prospects report.
Advanced economies are expected to shrink 7.0% in 2020, the report said, while emerging market economies will contract 2.5%, their first since aggregate data became available in 1960.
These forecasts predict a deeper slowdown than the estimates released in April by the International Monetary Fund, which predicted a 3.0% global contraction in 2020.
3. Stocks set to open lower, after bull market confirmation
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower, with investors set to take profits after Monday’s gains confirmed a bull market in the tech-driven Nasdaq Composite index.
By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), theDow Jones 30 futures contract was down 316 points or 1.2%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 1% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was 0.6% lower.
The Nasdaq has climbed over 40% from its March 23 bottom, making a new high and confirming a bull market, which is considered to have begun at the index's low, just 16 weeks after the coronavirus outbreak pushed the U.S. economy into recession.
The S&P 500 also ended in positive territory for the year, but remains about 4.5% below its record high close, while the Dow is about 6.7% below.
Stocks in focus Tuesday include spirits maker Brown Forman (NYSE:BFb), which is expected to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 28 cents a share on revenue $695 million. The company makes liquor brands including Jack Daniel's and Finlandia. And online pet food and grooming product supplier Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) is scheduled to report profit of 18 cents a share on revenue of $1.5 billion.
4. Oil prices retreat; More losses ahead?
Crude oil prices have sold off Tuesday, retreating from the three-month highs achieved after a group of major producers agreed to extend a deal on record output cuts to the end of July.
And more losses look likely going forward, according to Goldman Sachs.
""This rebound has been fueled by a macro risk-on backdrop and a policy induced Chinese crude import binge, yet fundamentals are turning bearish,"" Goldman said.
With demand expectations running ahead of a more gradual and still uncertain rebound, the oil market faces a big challenge of normalising a billion barrels of excess inventories, analysts at the bank wrote.
The investment bank expects Brent prices to reach $35 per barrel in the short term.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 2.3% at $37.30 a barrel, while the global benchmark Brent was down 1.8% at $40.06 a barrel.
5. Vroom to start trading after IPO
Online used-car seller Vroom (NASDAQ:VRM) is set to start trading Tuesday after pricing its initial public offering at $22 a share late Monday, above its previous range of $18-$20. 
The company is offering about 12.25 million shares, for a market capitalization of around $2.48 billion.
Vroom has not been profitable since its start in 2012, but is looking to benefit from the shift to online shopping accelerated by the pandemic. That said, the car industry, as a whole, has been suffering and Vroom has already had to cut prices and its profit margins have shrunk.
Investors will be watching this deal carefully, given the week is expected to see eight IPOs launched, raising about $2 billion,

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>",UK says demand for COVID loans hits nearly 35 billion pounds,"By William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses have borrowed nearly 35 billion pounds ($44 billion) under three emergency credit programmes for companies hit by the coronavirus crisis with demand strongest for a 100% state-backed scheme for the smallest firms.
After a recent warning by lenders that some of the borrowing might prove unsustainable for companies hit by the COVID lockdown, the Treasury said total lending under the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS) rose to 23.8 billion pounds by June 7 from 21.3 billion pounds by May 31.
That represented a slightly smaller increase than in the previous week.
The BBLS, which gives loans of up to 50,000 pounds, was launched in May after signs that other lending schemes were making slow progress.
The Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, which carries an 80% government guarantee for loans of up to 5 million ponds and was launched in March, reached 9.6 billion pounds, up from 8.9 billion pounds a week earlier.
The separate Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme saw approved lending rise to 1.6 billion pounds, up nearly 500 million pounds from a week earlier.
The finance ministry said its job retention scheme - which pays 80% of the salaries of employees who are temporarily laid off - now covered 8.9 million workers, up from 8.7 million a week earlier, costing 19.6 billion pounds so far.
A separate scheme for self-employed people had received 2.6 million claims for 7.5 billion pounds.
Last week, Britain's budget watchdog estimated that the two income support programmes were likely to cost nearly 70 billion pounds, more than the country's entire public sector borrowing last year.
It also estimated the government would take a 5 billion-pound hit in the current financial year from losses on its coronavirus loan programmes with further defaults likely in the future.
A group representing Britain's finance industry warned on Sunday that about a third of the debt being taken on by British companies under the coronavirus lending programmes could be unsustainable.

As well as the three schemes backed by the government, the Bank of England is holding just over 16 billion pounds' worth of debt issued by large companies with investment-grade credit ratings under its COVID-19 financing facility.

1394,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>",Jobs Rebound Spurs GOP Calls for Congress to Go Slow on Stimulus,"(Bloomberg) -- The surprise rebound on U.S. job markets is leading some Republicans to question the need for more pandemic stimulus, as Congress debates whether to renew the extra benefits it approved for unemployed Americans during the crisis.The payments of $600 a week, currently due to expire July 31, will be discussed at a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday. Republicans have argued that the need to juice the economy is receding, after 2.5 million jobs were created in May and the unemployment rate declined when it was expected to jump.
That data “underscores why Congress should take a thoughtful approach and not rush to pass expensive legislation paid for with more debt,” said Michael Zona, spokesman for committee chairman Chuck Grassley. President Donald Trump said last week he’ll ask Congress to pass more economic stimulus, including a payroll tax cut. The White House is looking to spend as much as $1 trillion, a figure that is said to have backing from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
‘Going to Struggle’
A growing number of Senate Republicans like Pennsylvania’s Pat Toomey want to slam the brakes on stimulus, and give the roughly $3 trillion that Congress already allocated time to work its way through the economy.
That spending surge, coupled with a plunge in revenue as the economy shut down, has put the U.S. on track for its biggest budget deficits since World War II. The shortfall in the fiscal year through May probably widened to $1.9 trillion, more than double the 2019 figure, the Congressional Budget Office said Monday.But most economists say the recovery is still too fragile for government support to be withdrawn –- and there’s support for that view in GOP circles too.“This jobs report should not take the wind out of the sails of another stimulus bill,” said Gordon Gray, the director of fiscal policy at the right-leaning American Acton Forum and a former staffer to Ohio Senator Rob Portman. “There are people who are going to struggle for a long time.”Portman is pushing a plan that would redirect stimulus rather than cut it off: a $450-a-week return-to-work bonus. He says it would deliver “significant cost savings compared to the current money we’re spending.” Backers of the plan, including White House economists, also say it would remove disincentives to work created by the ramped-up jobless benefits – an argument that resonates with Republicans.
‘Real-World Consequences’
Democrats say the May jobs report is evidence that the extra payments didn’t stop Americans returning to work -– and point to still-elevated unemployment levels.“If millions of Americans who remain unemployed are suddenly unable to pay their bills, the economy will get worse, not better,” said Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, the No. 2 on the Finance Committee. He cited a June 4 analysis by the CBO that said not extending the weekly benefit would damp growth in the second half of this year.
The Democrat-controlled House of Representatives already voted to keep the jobless payments in place, as part of additional stimulus measures worth some $3 trillion. That bill has no prospect of getting through the GOP-run Senate, where serious negotiations on another stimulus bill aren’t expected to start until mid-July – just a couple of weeks before unemployment insurance will revert to pre-virus levels.There’ll be “real-world consequences” if Congress doesn’t take action before that July 31 deadline, said Mattie Duppler, a senior fellow at the National Taxpayers Union.“When those UI benefits run out, we could see households feel the financial impact of the lockdown,” she said. “Luckily, the president doesn’t seem to be persuaded that there shouldn’t be another stimulus package.”

1395,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 04:30AM ET</span>","Global use of euro stabilizes near historic lows, ECB says","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The global use of the euro was broadly stable last year after a steady decline in the aftermath of the bloc's debt crisis but hopes for increased demand failed to materialize, a European Central Bank (ECB) report indicated on Tuesday. 
Launched over 20 years ago, the euro has always played second fiddle to the U.S. dollar, even as the European Commission has made it a goal to boost its global role, in part to reduce the bloc's reliance on the greenback during a period of growing global trade tensions.
The euro zone's financial architecture remains incomplete, however, as it lacks a common safe asset or a deposit insurance scheme, its bank sector is fragmented and the capital markets union is unfinished. 
The euro accounted for 20.5% of global foreign exchange reserves at the end of last year, up from 20.3% a year earlier, while its share in outstanding international debt securities declined to 22.1% from 22.4%, the ECB said in an annual assessment on the currency. 
In international deposits outside the bloc, the euro's role remained broadly unchanged while its share in outstanding international loans rose one percentage point.
""The recent COVID-19 pandemic underlines the urgency of these policies and reform efforts, which are paramount to raising the attractiveness of the euro globally,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said.
Much like the euro, the dollar has also lost market share over the past decade to other currencies, such as the Japanese yen and the British pound, but the two still account for over 80% of global foreign exchange reserves. 

""The share of the US dollar, the leading global reserve currency, declined further to a two-decade low, suggesting that the trend towards gradual diversification of global reserve portfolios continued,"" the ECB said.

With much of Europe shut down this spring by the coronavirus pandemic, governments are running record deficits to maintain jobs and production capacity until their countries can re-open.
""The general government finances of some EU countries have become so weakened by the crisis that their ability to support output and employment risks becoming entirely compromised, simply fuelling long-term challenges to the public finances,"" Rehn, Finland's central bank chief, said in a statement. 
""The corona crisis should not be used to introduce permanent increases in public expenditure that will further exacerbate an already substantial sustainability gap,"" Rehn said.

Italy's debt is expected to approach 160% of GDP by the end of this year, raising doubts among investors over its longer- term sustainability.

1398,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 03:45AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Banks to Berlin - Loosen coronavirus cash rules for firms,"By Tom Sims and John O'Donnell
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's bank lobby is set to urge the government to drop some of the conditions attached to a trillion euro rescue scheme, arguing that companies are so reluctant to take the help that it threatens any recovery from the coronavirus outbreak.
Martin Zielke, the head of the lobby and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), will appeal this week to limit conditions - like pay caps and board seats - for government cash injections into companies, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
Zielke argues that companies are taking on further debt, the chief means of government support, as prospects for revenue dim, and Berlin should offer capital injections with fewer strings, according to a paper outlining his position seen by Reuters.
Companies will not otherwise accept help, the three people said, citing Zielke, whose Commerzbank caters to the Mittlestand companies that form the backbone of the German economy and was bailed out during the last financial crisis. The state still holds a 15% stake in Commerzbank and occupies two board seats.
A spokeswoman for Germany's economy ministry, led by Peter Altmaier, said the high number of applications for state support from companies, and the payment of tens of billions of euros of credit and other assistance, was proof of the scheme's success.
It conducted a survey in May of companies it thought particularly vulnerable to the virus outbreak and that found that more than three quarters of those firms had applied for at least one form of support.
By contrast, a recent internal survey by Germany's influential BDI industry lobby showed that most of more than 150 small and medium Mittelstand companies are avoiding state help, choosing to slash investment and jobs or tap savings instead.
""Industrial Mittelstand firms have so far been reluctant to accept financial help from the state,"" said Hans-Toni Junius, who chairs a BDI committee looking at the matter. ""The goal remains financial independence.""
The criticism from the banks and companies highlights cracks in Europe's biggest economic support scheme, the envy of Germany's more indebted neighbours.
There are two groups companies ""really do not trust"", said Peer-Robin Paulus, an executive of a German association representing family-owned business. ""One is the government; the other is the big banks.""
Most aid comes in the form of loans. But schemes to tap government funds in return for an equity stake require limits on management pay, restrictions on use of funds and the government taking seats on corporate boards.
So far, only Lufthansa is tapping Germany's 100 billion euro fund for recapitilizing companies although others are exploring it. 
Lufthansa clinched a deal for a 9 billion euro bailout in which the government will get a 20% stake and two board seats.

Talks hit a snag at one point last month when some in government insisted on terms that Lufthansa favour orders from Europe's Airbus over Boeing (NYSE:BA) of the U.S., but CEO Carsten Spohr said they were able to ""negotiate those away"".

1399,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>",Explainer: How will Britain pay for coronavirus borrowing?,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British government borrowing is soaring to levels not seen since World War Two, something Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his finance minister Rishi Sunak will try to fix once the worst of the coronavirus crisis has passed.
Government forecasters think the budget deficit could jump five-fold to 300 billion pounds ($380 billion) this year or around 15% of annual economic output. 
By comparison, after the global financial crisis the deficit peaked at 10% and it took almost a decade of spending cuts to bring it down to around 2% last year. Graphic: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/yxmvjkyozpr/index.html
Johnson has suggested that more spending is on the way by promising to ""double down"" on his plans for more public infrastructure investment.
Sunak has said little about how he might tackle the surge in public debt estimated to hit 2.2 trillion pounds this year, beyond hinting that self-employed workers might see their tax bills rise.
HOW IS BRITAIN FUNDING ITS BORROWING?
Helped by the Bank of England's huge bond-buying programme and its record low interest rates, Britain is selling bonds to investors at an unprecedented pace, with 225 billion pounds of issuance planned between April and July. 
The government feels under less pressure than in 2010, when it feared a Greece-style loss of confidence among investors.
Last month it sold a three-year bond with a negative yield.
In the short run, the OBR expects debt servicing costs to fall as lower interest rates outweigh the burden of the extra borrowing.
HOW WILL BRITAIN CUT THE DEFICIT AFTER THE CRISIS?
Much of the borrowing surge is caused by programmes that the government hopes will be temporary. Its income support programmes for workers are likely to cost more than 100 billion pounds but they are due to end by October.
The government hopes its unprecedented support will allow the economy to revive after coronavirus restrictions are lifted.
Initial forecasts from Britain's budget forecasters and the BoE assumed little long-term economic damage. 
But policymakers now see a risk of so-called scarring to hotels, airlines, bars and restaurants due to changed customer behaviour and reduced demand for city-centre office space.
Almost all recessions have caused some scarring, and Britain - like other countries - is likely to face a persistent budget hole after the crisis, HSBC economist Stephen King said.
But significant spending cuts are unlikely with voters tired of austerity and Johnson committing to invest more, leaving tax rises as the most obvious option.
However, Johnson promised before 2019's election not to raise the rates of income tax, value-added tax or national insurance, the three biggest sources of revenue.
HOW HAS BRITAIN REDUCED DEBT LEVELS BEFORE?
In the past, British debt-to-GDP levels have risen far higher than now, peaking at 259% of GDP in 1946. 
Strong economic growth, and low interest rates relative to inflation, played a much bigger role in reducing debt over the following 20 years than tax rises or spending cuts, according to economic historian Nicholas Crafts.
By contrast, between World War One and World War Two, high interest rates, slow growth and the Great Depression negated the impact of the government's sizeable budget surpluses.
This time, the picture is mixed with interest rates and inflation both low and a growth outlook that has been weak for more than a decade.
Britain's large stock of inflation-linked bonds makes it harder to inflate away debt as happened in the past, even if the government raised the BoE's inflation target.
For HSBC's King, the closest historic parallel to today is the Napoleonic Wars at the start of the 19th century - when Britain introduced income tax.
""It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, once again, the taxman cometh,"" he said.

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 01:20AM ET</span>","Once bitten, not shy: Investors again seek margin loans as stocks rally","By Megan Davies and Sumeet Chatterjee
NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global banks are seeing renewed appetite from wealth management clients to borrow money to buy stocks as markets rebound, bankers said, which comes just months after the strategy burned some investors. 
Low interest rates as central banks support the global economy and the rapid rebound from the lows in March are leading investors to turn to margin accounts, where they borrow money from the brokerage to buy assets, in order to boost profits, several bankers familiar with the matter said. 
Overall debit balances in customers' securities margin accounts in the United States, which includes both retail and institutional margin lending, rose to $525 billion in April, up from $479 billion in March, according to data from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The balance is still below the $562 billion at the beginning of the year. 
While clients were not returning to margin borrowing at the level they were before the crash, ""things are better than a month back,"" said Murtuza Rasiwala, Americas head of banking, custody, escrow and margin and securities-backed financing at  Citigroup  Inc (N:C).
Rasiwala said that there were ""certain pockets where clients who did not have any additional liquidity to pump in had to liquidate their portfolio."" However, he said that the rebound happened quickly ""so clients who had liquidity on the side could support the portfolio for that brief period."" 
Adam Holtzschue, head of core banking for  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Wealth and Investment Management, said the ""market disruption was challenging to anyone who had exposure, long or short,"" but added that clients' use of leverage was ""conservative"".
Some investors saw the market crash as a buying opportunity.
U.S. stocks rebounded rapidly from their March lows, with the Nasdaq posting a record closing high on Monday and the S&P 500 Index around 4.5% below its record high.
In another sign of appetite for risk, single-stock lending--often deemed a more high-risk business--appears to remain attractive. Philipp Wehle, the head of  Credit Suisse 's (S:CSGN) international wealth management division, said such lending was still on offer, with the unit recently undertaking a major single-stock transaction with a long-standing emerging market client.
The renewed interest since the market crash is good news for banks, which typically make money from both the loans they give investors and the fees they charge them. But it also shows how risk is increasing in the market even as the coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the global economy and new threats to the rally emerge. 
Some investors who borrowed to buy shares were saddled with losses when markets fell earlier this year, as several banks moved quickly to liquidate collateral they held against those loans, securities lawyers and private bankers said. 
""A lot of folks didn't realize how much risk they had all these years during this bull run,"" said Matt Wolper, at Wolper Law Firm in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 
Rick Ryder, founder of Securities Arbitration Commentator, said in an email last month that he expects a significant rise in customer disputes and new arbitration case filings at FINRA as a result of the market fall in February/March. 
Such disputes also rose during the 2007-2009, after the financial crisis, according to FINRA data of cases filed and closed. 
Still, margin lending remains a lucrative business for banks. How lucrative is hard to measure because banks do not typically break out the amount captured from such loans. It can, however, be a source of losses for banks if the markets crash. This time around, some securities lawyers and bankers familiar with the matter said banks moved quickly to liquidate collateral and minimize their losses. 

Some are tightening the standards further now as margin accounts make a comeback, by being more conservative on the types of securities they lend against and the amount of leverage used, bankers said. ""The March market mayhem was in a way a good wake-up call for all of us,"" said a banker at a European wealth manager that manages more than $200 billion in client assets.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's money stock, or currency in circulation and bank deposits, rose at the fastest annual pace on record in May as companies hoarded cash to guard against slumping sales from the coronavirus pandemic, central bank data showed on Tuesday.
The data underscores the disruption the health crisis is causing to corporate activity and the flow of money, leaving policymakers dealing with the stiff challenge of reviving an economy in the throes of a deep recession.
Japan's M3 money stock - or currency in circulation and deposits at financial institutions - rose 4.1% in May from a year earlier, marking the biggest increase since comparable data became available in 2004, Bank of Japan data showed.
The increase was faster than a 3.0% gain in April.
Of the total amount, deposits at financial institutions jumped 10.1% in May, the fastest pace of increase since 2017, to reach a record 770 trillion yen ($7.12 trillion).
""Companies are borrowing more amid the coronavirus pandemic and parking money in bank deposits, so they have more cash at hand to meet immediate funding needs,"" a BOJ official told reporters.
Data released on Monday showed Japanese bank lending rose at the fastest annual pace on record in May, as cash-strapped firms tapped loans to pay for fixed costs that emerge even when they are suspending operations.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced a state of emergency in April requesting citizens to stay home and businesses to close.
Although the emergency was lifted in late May, analysts expect the economy to recover only moderately from a deepening recession in the face of the pandemic's sweeping global impact.

The Demystifying Chinese Investment in Australia report by KPMG and The University of Sydney also showed the number of Chinese investment deals dropped 43% to 42, from 74 in 2018. One deal -- Mengniu Dairy Co.’s acquisition of Bellamy’s Australia Ltd. for A$1.5 billion, accounted for 43.7% of the year’s total.

Even as China remains Australia’s largest trading partner, there are increasing signs of a widening rift between the nations.
Australia announced on Friday it will implement a tougher screening regime on foreign investors seeking to buy sensitive assets, with telecommunications, energy, technology and defense-manufacturing companies to be included in the zero-dollar threshold for screening.
Factors contributing to last year’s investment decline include tighter Chinese regulations for overseas deals, state-owned enterprises reducing investments in developed markets in favor of developing nations, and negative perceptions by China toward stricter investment regulations by the Australian government, according to report co-author Doug Ferguson.
“Chinese companies have invested over $107 billion into Australia since 2008 and this capital has been a really important contributor to economic growth locally, but new investment is slowing,” Ferguson, KPMG Australia’s head for Asia, said in a statement. Chinese investments in Australia will “remain subdued in the coming year,” he said.
The food and agribusiness sector accounted for the largest proportion of Chinese investment in 2019 with 44% of the total, or A$1.53 billion. That was followed by commercial real estate, with 43%, or A$1.48 billion.
Australia’s investment-screening changes announced Friday could have implications for its relations with China, which have soured this year after Prime Minister Scott Morrison led calls for an independent probe into the origins of the coronavirus in Wuhan.
Beijing responded with verbal attacks on the conservative government, saying it was doing the bidding of key ally the U.S., while new tariffs on Australian barley and a ban on beef from four meatworks have raised fears in Canberra that the Chinese government is using “economic coercion” in retaliation.
On Saturday in a further sign of strained relations, China warned its citizens not to travel in Australia, saying it was unsafe due to discrimination and violent behavior against Chinese and Asians.

1404,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 08:18PM ET</span>",Getting to the Bottom of Key Questions in Shock U.S. Jobs Report,"(Bloomberg) -- The shock of Friday’s U.S. jobs report is still rippling through economic circles, politics and financial markets.
The 2.5 million increase in payrolls and decline in the unemployment rate -- albeit to a still-sky-high 13.3% -- confounded expectations for another sharp deterioration in both measures.
Beyond how economists flubbed the forecasts, the report has spurred many other questions, from how to reconcile the figures with jobless-claims numbers showing about 9 million more claiming unemployment insurance benefits, to what to make of a recurring data-collection issue by the Labor Department, to how many jobs the federal Paycheck Protection Program actually saved.
Below, we try to answer some of these questions:
Wait, so is the real unemployment rate 16%?
Kind of. As the Bureau of Labor Statistics detailed, survey-takers misclassified a lot of people -- around 5 million -- as employed but absent from work, rather than unemployed on temporary layoff. If you counted those people as unemployed, the jobless rate would have been about 3 percentage points higher on an unadjusted basis -- or about 16%.
The April report said the unemployment rate would have been almost 5 percentage points higher -- or approaching 20%. So both of these statements are true: the rate fell in May, and the real (unofficial) unemployment rate was higher than the given figure in both months.
The jobs report showed 21 million Americans unemployed, but the weekly jobless claims report said 30 million are claiming continuing unemployment benefits in all programs. What gives?
It’s not actually 21 million, even though that’s the official number. If you adjust the figures for the misclassification detailed above, the true number of unemployed is closer to 26 million or 27 million, according to Nick Bunker, an economic research director for the jobs website Indeed.
OK, so we’re still off by 3 million or 4 million. What explains the rest of the gap?
There are several possibilities.
First, many states have waived the requirement that one be searching for work to be eligible for unemployment benefits. Yet, if people aren’t searching for work, the BLS doesn’t typically count them as unemployed -- instead they’re considered “not in labor force,” with such outsiders still numbering 6.7 million people more than before the pandemic. Workers expecting to be recalled from temporary layoff are counted as unemployed whether or not they have engaged in a specific job-seeking activity.
Another potential culprit is that many of the self-employed and gig workers who are out of work and on the new federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits -- 10.7 million people as of the week ended May 16 -- are being classified as something other than unemployed, according to Betsey Stevenson, a University of Michigan economist and former U.S. Labor Department chief economist.
“It’s difficult to say how they would be coded in the BLS survey, but I would count them as on temporary layoff,” Stevenson said. “But given the drop in unemployment and the numbers that the BLS survey is capturing, my guess is that many of the 10.7 million were not counted as unemployed.”
Is it possible that the BLS survey wasn’t fully representative of the population?
Yes. While it’s true that the response rates for both the establishment survey -- which produces the payroll number -- and the household surveys were lower than their pre-pandemic levels, the BLS said both surveys met standards for accuracy and reliability.
Still, Stevenson said the low response rates “could cause problems because they are unlikely to be a random sample of people who are missing. If they are different in important ways that aren’t visible in the data, then the BLS would not have been able to adequately compensate for them.”
What about the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) report, which said businesses cut 2.8 million jobs?
Many economists discount the ADP figures -- based on the payroll company’s customer records -- as an unreliable predictor of the government’s jobs report, typically coming two days later. But Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, which compiles the ADP report, said the ADP number actually provides a better representation of the reality of the May job market as of the BLS survey week than the BLS number itself.
In fact, a Federal Reserve research paper from 2019 found that pooling the BLS payroll numbers and a series derived from ADP could come closer to the true state of employment. So it’s possible that the truth for May was somewhere in between the ADP and BLS numbers.
So, what really happened in the labor market in May?
Probably two things, assuming the BLS’s snapshot matches reality: an unusually large number of people being recalled or hired, and an unusually large -- but smaller -- number of people losing their jobs.
“We saw a tremendous amount of churn,” said Erica Groshen, a former BLS commissioner appointed by President Barack Obama.
Economists may have in particular underestimated the number of people rehired under the PPP aid program. Holly Wade, director of research and policy analysis at the small-business group National Federation of Independent Business, said a mid-May survey of members found that 73% said they rehired or retained workers specifically due to PPP.
Groshen also cautioned that the weekly jobless claims figures produced by a different agency in the U.S. Labor Department, while relevant, aren’t necessarily directly comparable as an indicator with the monthly employment surveys produced by the BLS.
In any case, even with some improvement in May, the unemployment rate remains extremely high -- much higher than any rate seen in the Great Recession -- and economic activity is nowhere close to where it was pre-pandemic.
“The U.S. labor market, while showing some signs of bouncing back from the coronavirus shock, is still in a pretty dire spot,” Indeed’s Bunker said.

1405,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 07:30PM ET</span>",Column: Spend or hoard? Fate of forced savings could define pandemic recovery - Mike Dolan,"(The author is editor-at-large for finance and markets at Reuters News. Any views expressed here are his own)
By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - Many households have built up a stash of savings during the coronavirus lockdowns of the past three months -- and how they view them may dictate the speed of recovery from the pandemic.
Although the shock has caused spikes in unemployment, most households spent lockdown periods either working from home, furloughed or on direct government income support. And with few goods or services available to buy, their savings have soared.
Whether people see these unexpected cash hoards as a windfall or a buffer against future uncertainties is likely to determine the speed of the recovery, at least this year.
If the public treats the money like a tax rebate, spending could surge, says Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS's global wealth management arm. He points to U.S. tax rebates in 2001 and 2008, money from which was fully spent within about two quarters -- mostly on durable goods such as furniture and consumer electronics.
As lockdowns lift with no second wave of virus infections so far, pent-up spending could be a big boost to third-quarter consumption -- underlining why some investors still believe in a ""V-shaped"" recovery.
""This involuntary saving could be spent. It will depend on fear and trust,"" Donovan said. ""Fear of the virus and fear of unemployment need to be low. Trust in government policy needs to be relatively high.
""These are, after all, savings that many people never wanted in the first place -- at least as far as saving on entertainment and services is concerned.""
CASH STASH
U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data last week showed the personal savings rate almost trebled to a record 33%, or $6.15 trillion, in April -- having already doubled to more than $2 trillion in March. In the six months before, the average was nearly $1.3 trillion, or just under 8%.
Directly comparable data for Europe, which locked down earlier, is not yet available, but the European Commission is forecasting that household savings rates will nearly double to 20% this year. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) meanwhile points to a record jump of over 300 billion euros in euro zone private sector deposit inflows in March, although that will include firms building up cash to survive the freeze. 
And on Tuesday, Bank of England data showed UK household deposits rose by 30 billion pounds over March and April compared to average monthly increases of 5 billion pounds in the six months prior. There was also record net repayment of consumer credit of 7.4 billion pounds in April alone.
Donovan notes that despite the large aggregate numbers, the distribution is scattered. 
For many furloughed workers in Europe, for example, income has been at 80% of normal levels. But spending has probably declined by 20-30% across the major economies.
Some American households may even see a temporary rise in weekly incomes as they claim jobless benefits of $1,000 per week -- higher than half of all working wages. They also get a $1,200 one-off government payment.
It is higher income groups that tend to save more, however, as they spend a smaller share of their incomes on food and essentials. Much of that discretionary spending is on services such as travel, restaurants and entertainment that have largely been unavailable during the crisis.
POLICY TWISTS
While major uncertainties remain about the reopening of economies, job security, the trajectory of the virus and a potential vaccine, government and central bank policies will help determine whether this money leaves bank accounts as quickly as it arrived.
Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff argues that preventing cash hoarding is one reason why the U.S. Federal Reserve should consider adopting negative interest rates -- effectively a charge for not spending -- as European central banks have done. 
Others fear zero and negative deposit rates just lead to a ""paradox of thrift"", where people put aside even more to make up for lost returns -- further swelling the savings glut.
For governments, the issue may also inform post-pandemic support. With private consumption the main driver of economic activity -- as high as 70% of GDP in the United States --  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economists say changes in savings patterns could easily offset any new fiscal measures.
They argue that fear of future tax rises to fix public finances could prompt household caution -- so-called ""Ricardian equivalence"", a phenomenon sketched by 19th century economist David Ricardo suggesting the public's behaviour in response to government saving or borrowing offsets the impact of policies.

What is clear is that current bloated savings levels mean confidence, or lack of it, could have a snowballing impact in the second half of 2020. Financial markets are already taking that on board.

Britons drastically reduced spending last month after about a third of families experienced a loss of income, reports on Tuesday showed. Those in trouble with debt are borrowing more, while shops are waiting to see how much business will bounce back.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is moving to loosen lockdown restrictions that have been in place since March 23. More stores will re-open on June 15, and pubs and restaurants may be able to serve customers outside from July 4.
The orders to work from home and maintain social distancing has hit poorer people harder. One in three low-paid workers have been furloughed, lost their jobs or seen their hours cut, compared with 15% of high earners, the Resolution Foundation said.
While about a third of all Britons have reported loss of income, richer families have been more likely to improve their financial situation during the crisis, the think tank said.
Consumer spending contracted 27% in May from a year earlier, Barclaycard said. Spending on essential items from stores like supermarkets grew by 0.9% while non-essential goods such as clothing dropped 36.9%.
Still, household optimism in their finances remains high, with more than two-thirds saying they have enough savings to weather the crisis, Barclaycard said.
“While the restrictions continue to have a significant impact there are glimmers of hope,” said Esme Harwood, a director at credit-card provider.
Retail sales posted a smaller decline last month than in April, the British Retail Consortium reported. Still, it was the second-biggest drop on record and shops are wondering whether demand will return when the lockdown ends.
Personal debt has shot up during the pandemic, the charity StepChange said in a separate report Tuesday. Households have added about 6 billion pounds ($7 billion) of debt as measures to stop the spread of the disease kept people away from work.

TOKYO (Reuters) - When Japanese firm Iris Ohyama agreed in April to begin producing much-needed face masks in Japan, it marked a win for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who wants to bring manufacturing back from China.
Spooked by coronavirus-induced factory shutdowns in China, Abe's government has earmarked $2 billion to help companies shift production home. The policy, part of a massive stimulus package to cope with the pandemic, has even been termed by some bureaucrats as a matter of national security. 
""We have become dependent on China,"" Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters last week. ""We need to make supply chains more robust and diverse, broadening our supply sources and increasing domestic production."" 
Japanese production of masks, for which domestic demand has skyrocketed, makes sense. But Iris Ohyama, which until this month had only made face masks in China, is so far the only large firm known to be taking advantage of the subsidies.
Many other Japanese firms say shifting output back home is simply impractical and uneconomical. They need to be physically present in China because much of what they are making is ultimately for the Chinese consumer, and to meet the demands of 'just-in-time' production which prioritises short delivery times for efficient manufacturing.
""The parts we make are so big that we need to be near our customers to control our costs,"" said Chikara Haruta, a spokesman at  Yorozu Corp  (T:7294), which makes suspension and other auto components.
Its plant in Wuhan, China is located just seven kilometres from a Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) assembly factory.
For Japan's car makers, reliance on Chinese suppliers in the world's biggest auto market is also just good business.
""Even if we wanted to, it would be difficult to lower our exposure to China-made parts,"" an executive at a Japanese automaker told Reuters, declining to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media.
He added that over the past decade, Chinese suppliers had upped their game and now provide a vast range of quality, low-cost parts.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) and Honda also have at least three R&D centres each in China, and their suppliers are following suit.
""Where the software is developed dictates where the hardware is developed and made,"" said an official at a Japanese parts supplier, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""The new government incentive is misguided if it only focuses on bringing manufacturing back, while overlooking R&D functions.""
OVERLY DEPENDENT? 
Japanese politicians have increasingly fretted over Japan's dependence on China as a production hub.
Since the early 2000s as Chinese labour costs rose, there has been talk of a ""China Plus One"" strategy — a policy of managing risk by locating plants and facilities in China and one other Asian nation. It gained more traction in 2012 when bilateral tensions flared and many Japanese firms have sought to diversify with operations in Southeast Asia. 
The near total shutdown of China's factories in February as the world's No. 2 economy sought to stamp out the coronavirus has, however, rammed Japan's China dependence home.
The government's 220 billion yen ($2 billion) allocation is the first time it has offered subsidies for bringing back manufacturing. It is also offering 23.5 billion yen to Japanese firms to strengthen and diversify supply chains in Southeast Asia.
Japanese firms had at least 7,400 affiliates in China as of March 2018, according to a trade ministry survey, up 60% from 2008. In the same year, Japanese manufacturing affiliates in China sold $252 billion in goods, with 73% of that sold in China and 17% exported back home, a separate survey by the ministry shows.

CHOOSING CHINA
Electronics makers too say they would struggle to sever ties with China's supply chains.
 Nidec Corp  (T:6594), which produces motors for electronic goods, even said in April it needed to improve its supply chain in China. It was unable to procure supplies of a basic part this year which it had believed was sourced locally but was in fact being shipped from Europe.
""We need to strengthen sourcing capabilities at our Chinese plants. We should be producing these sorts of parts in-house,"" CEO Shigenobu Nagamori told reporters.
 Japan Display Inc  (T:6740) and chipmaker Rohm Co Ltd (T:6963) say potential shifts to full automation for labour-intensive back-end processes done overseas could lead to new assembly lines being built at home where more advanced manufacturing takes place. 
But for many others, China remains the cheaper option.
Display panel and television maker Sharp Corp (T:6753) produces ultra-thin panel cells in Japan, which are shipped to China where backlights, connectors and other parts are added - a process that requires constant manual testing and machinery adjustments. 
""The back-end process has long been done in China because it's labour intensive,"" said a spokesman at Sharp, which was acquired by Taiwan's Foxconn (TW:2317) in 2016.
""It would be expensive to bring it back home.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve eased the terms of its ""Main Street"" lending program on Monday, cutting the minimum loan size in half to $250,000 and lengthening the term by a year to encourage more businesses and banks to participate.
The central bank also said registration for the program will begin soon and that lenders will be able to start making the loans to small and medium-sized businesses shortly thereafter. 
The changes, which the Fed said was based on outreach with potential lenders and borrowers, address some of the concerns raised by lenders, lawyers and small business consultants that the previous minimum loan amount of $500,000 was too large to help many businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
""Supporting small and mid-sized businesses so they are ready to reopen and rehire workers will help foster a broad-based economic recovery,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement. 
The Fed is further minimizing downside risks for banks and credit unions by purchasing 95% of all loans issued through the program, rather than a range of 85% to 95%. 
The new borrowing minimum may still not be low enough as some businesses need loans smaller than $250,000, Jill Castilla, president and CEO of Citizens Bank of Edmond in Oklahoma said on Twitter after the Fed announced the changes. 
The Fed also extended the repayment period to five years from four, with no principal due until year two rather than after year one, which could help small businesses struggling due to the crisis. 
The adjustments may not lead to increased demand from borrowers who previously qualified, said Matt Kulkin, co-chair of the financial services group at Steptoe & Johnson.

Some companies may be deterred by the Fed's disclosure of borrower information, or by limits on executive compensation, dividends or stock buybacks, said Kulkin.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exactly 100 days after the first coronavirus case was confirmed in New York City, some workers began returning to jobs on Monday at the start of reopening from a citywide shutdown to battle the epidemic that killed nearly 22,000 of its residents.
People who had been staying home for months boarded subways and buses as the most populous U.S. city began Phase One of its hopeful journey toward economic recovery.
""This is clearly the hardest place in America to get to this moment because we're the epicenter,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio told a news conference at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
New York, by far the hardest-hit U.S. city, on Monday reported the rate of people testing positive for the coronavirus fell to a new low of 3%, well below its threshold for reopening of 15%, de Blasio said.
As some 400,000 workers head back to 32,000 construction sites, wholesale and manufacturing centers and some retail sites across the city, de Blasio urged them to wear face masks and use social distancing to keep COVID-19 cases on a downward trend - particularly those who use mass transit to get to work.
Subway rider Jim Duke, who commutes from the New York suburb of Putnam County, said normally packed trains had few enough riders to accommodate social distancing from other commuters.
""There's not a lot of people on there, so it's fairly easy. So far,"" said Duke, wearing a face mask.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo noted that the rest of the state had already entered the same reopening phase without a jump in infections, largely because of restrictions that limit restaurants to serving guests only outdoors and retailers to making only curbside sales.
""If we follow those guidelines in New York City, there should not be a spike, just like there hasn't been a spike across the rest of the state,"" Cuomo said.
De Blasio said the city is opening 20 miles (32 km) of new bus routes and new bus lanes from June through October to increase spacing between mass transit passengers.

The mayor said he was cautiously monitoring the virus' spread after thousands of protesters - many without masks - swarmed New York streets for daily marches against racism following the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, to be sure reopening can continue and eventually bring customers back to hair salons, restaurants and other businesses.

The Trump administration has talked about bringing supply chains home from China, and even publicly floated the need for a group of friendly nations in Asia that could help produce essential goods. President Donald Trump last month even said the U.S. would “save $500 billion” if it cut off ties with China.
But interviews with nearly a dozen government officials and analysts in the Asia-Pacific region show that any broader effort to restructure supply chains is little more than wishful thinking so far. While governments are pushing to win investments, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s planned state-of-the-art semiconductor factory in the U.S., it won’t be simple to dismantle an entrenched system when many companies are struggling to survive.
More likely is that the virus will accelerate a change that was already driven by market forces as rising wages and costs in China over the past decade caused an exodus of lower-value manufacturing, much of it to Southeast Asia. That’s despite the desire from some in the Trump administration to start decoupling the world’s biggest economies as the U.S. and China spar over everything from the virus to 5G networks to Hong Kong.
“The rhetoric meets the reality, which is that many firms have supply chains set up the way they do for very sensible reasons,” said Deborah Elms of the Asian Trade Centre, which has seen an increase of companies looking for advice on reorganizing to increase competitiveness. “Coming out of Covid, it’s going to be even harder to move supply chains because your cash flow is low, your staff are working from home or coming slowly back into the office, and the business climate has shifted.”
While the world trade network mostly held up well amid rolling lockdowns as Covid-19 spread, the economic cost fueled calls among politicians for greater self-sufficiency and alternatives to China. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, whose department announced an Economic Security Strategy last year, in April named Australia, New Zealand, Japan, India, and South Korea as countries that the U.S. has been talking to on supply chains.
A key plank of the State Department’s new Economic Security Strategy is expanding and diversifying supply chains that protect “people in the free world,” according to Keith Krach, a State Department official who leads efforts to develop international policies related to economic growth.
Krach said in April a so-called “Economic Prosperity Network” of like-minded allies would be built for critical products.
Industries would include pharmaceuticals, medical devices, semiconductors, automotive, aerospace, textiles and chemicals, among others.
But the idea right now appears to lack any firm foundation. The State Department doesn’t have jurisdiction over trade, and officials in other Asian countries said no formal talks were taking place. A person close to the administration said Krach is prone to pushing grand ideas publicly that haven’t yet become policy.
Still, other governments are moving on their own to shift production away from China -- especially since the Covid disruptions. This includes Taiwan and Japan, which were among the biggest investors in China’s manufacturing capacity in the early days.
“Many companies have already begun adopting a ‘China plus one’ manufacturing hub strategy since the U.S.-China trade war began in 2018, with Vietnam having been a clear beneficiary,” said Anwita Basu, head of Asia country risk research at Fitch Solutions. While the pandemic will give that another push, “shifts away from China will be slow as that country still boasts an annual manufacturing output that is so large that even a group of countries would struggle to absorb a fraction of it.”
In 2019, Taiwanese officials encouraged the island’s firms to build a “non-red supply chain” outside of China, passing a law that promised rent assistance, cheap finance, tax breaks and simplified administration for investments in Taiwan. The move helped the island’s economy weather the trade war last year and led to more than NT$1 trillion ($33.5 billion) pledged or invested domestically, and more overseas.
Japan recently started down the same path, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government budgeting about 220 billion yen ($2 billion) for companies shifting production back home and 23.5 billion yen for those seeking to move production to other countries.
“Everyone agrees we really have to reconsider the sustainability of supply chains,” Hiroaki Nakanishi, chairman of Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Ltd. and head of Japan’s biggest business lobby Keidanren, said on television last month. “It’s unrealistic to suddenly return all production to Japan. But if we are totally reliant on one specific country and they have a lockdown, there will be huge consequences.”
For all that, China retains some key advantages. Last year 38% of Taiwan’s $11 billion of overseas investment still went to the mainland, as did 10% of Japan’s -- despite increased investments in Southeast Asia over the past few decades due to periodic bouts of anti-Japanese rioting in China.
Young Liu, chairman of Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry, whose Foxconn unit manufactures iPhone in plants in China, said in mid-May that it’s difficult to move assembly of mobile devices to the U.S due to the sheer number of workers needed.
“China remains unmatched as a manufacturing site given its numbers of skilled workers, deep supplier networks and the government’s credible public support for manufacturers and provision of reliable infrastructure,” wrote Gavekal analyst Dan Wang in a report in April.
Even if companies find economic alternatives to Chinese factories, or bow to political pressure to increase production in their home markets, there’s another reason why production inside China continues to make sense: the vast and growing Chinese domestic market.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. is now producing cars there for what is now the world’s largest auto market, and last month Chinese Premier Li Keqiang sent Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON). a letter welcoming its new investment in Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus outbreak started. He and other Chinese officials have touted continued economic cooperation with the U.S. and vowed to implement a “phase one” trade deal with the U.S. reached in January.
‘Unrealistic and Insensible’
“The formation and development of global industrial and supply chains are determined by market forces and companies’ choices,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in March. “As such, it is unrealistic and insensible to try to sever them or even trumpet ‘shifting’ or ‘decoupling’ theories as they run counter to economic law.”
For all the talk of dependence on China, the pandemic showed that other nations could quickly adapt to meet the need for critical supplies when China’s lockdown halted deliveries of protective clothing, ventilators and medical supplies. Vietnam rapidly ramped up production of face masks, exporting more than 415 million in four months, while the U.S. pushed automakers and other manufacturers to retool plants to make respirators and other critical supplies.
Over the long term, however, there are questions of whether those models are sustainable -- and who will pay for new plants outside China.
A May 14 executive order from Trump allows the U.S. International Development Finance Corp., America’s development bank for emerging markets, to partner with the Department of Defense in the U.S. to lend money to American companies looking to build out supply chains for critical goods such as ventilators and generic drugs.
Trillions of Dollars
But with governments already having to fund trillions of dollars in bailout packages for existing businesses and companies going bust in droves, finding the extra capital to restructure global supply chains is a tall order. Andrew Hastie, an Australian lawmaker and chair of the nation’s security and intelligence committee, called in a recent essay for “time limited tax incentives” to build national self-reliance in key pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and other critical goods.
In the end, the biggest force diluting China’s position in the global supply chain will likely be the long, slow evolution of global trade, as companies see opportunities that arise from new markets, new technologies and changing patterns of wealth. Why would a firm “say to their staff and their shareholders we have opted for political reasons to change the way that we do things,” said Elms, whose organization helps governments formulate trade policy.
“The numbers have to make sense,” she said. “The structure that you have is based on millions of individual company decisions. It’s not so easy to wave a wand and say: Make it so!”

After decades outsourcing its trade policy to the European Union, Britain is embarking on negotiating free trade deals with countries around the world, and last month launched formal negotiations with the United States. 
Trade deals typically take years to complete. Britain is also hoping to reach a trade agreement with the EU by the end of the year.
Talks will be held via video conference and will be kicked off by British trade minister Liz Truss and Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs   Toshimitsu Motegi on Tuesday.
""This deal will provide more opportunities for businesses and individuals across every region and nation of the UK and help boost our economies following the unprecedented economic challenges posed by coronavirus,"" Truss said in a statement.
Britain said it aimed to reach a deal which builds on Japan's existing agreement with the EU, going further by including areas such as digital trade.
Japan was Britain's fourth-biggest non-EU trading partner in 2019, with total trade between the two countries of 31.4 billion pounds, according to government statistics. 
Britain hopes ultimately to join the 11-member Comprehensive and Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), and sees trade talks with Japan as a step towards that end.

Britain said around 100 negotiators would be involved on its side, with talks led by Graham (NYSE:GHM) Zebedee, a former British ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo, and overseen by Britain's Chief Trade Negotiation Adviser Crawford Falconer.

1412,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 04:35PM ET</span>",It's official: U.S. economy entered recession in February,"By Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - The U.S. economy ended its longest expansion in history in February and entered recession as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the private economics research group that acts as the arbiter for determining U.S. business cycles said on Monday.
The Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research said in a statement its members ""concluded that the unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warrants the designation of this episode as a recession, even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions.""
The designation was expected, but notable for its speed, coming a mere four months after the recession began. The committee has typically waited longer before making a recession call in order to be sure. When the economy started declining in late 2007, for example, the group did not pinpoint the start of the recession until a year later. 
Graphic: The COVID-19 Recession - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvzqarmpw/Pasted%20image%201591635388754.png
But the depth and speed of this collapse left little doubt. 
""In deciding whether to identify a recession, the committee weighs the depth of the contraction, its duration, and whether economic activity declined broadly across the economy. ... The committee recognizes that the pandemic and the public health response have resulted in a downturn with different characteristics and dynamics than prior recessions,"" the committee said in a statement.
U.S. gross domestic product fell at a 4.8% annualized rate in the first three months of the year. The outcome for the April to June period is expected to show an even worse annualized decline of perhaps 20% or more. The unemployment rate rose from a record low of 3.5% in February, hitting 14.7% in April and 13.3% last month.
But growth may well recover from there, possibly making the current downturn not only among the sharpest but also among the shortest on record.
Since World War Two recessions have lasted from six to 18 months, nothing close to the 43-month downturn of the Great Depression that began in 1929.
Though the data that began to accumulate in March rival some of the statistics from the Depression era, economists expect growth to resume this summer and likely continue unless the virus resurges.
“It could very well be that this is the beginning of the trough,"" Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the National Retail Federation, said in an economic outlook seminar organized by the National Association for Business Economics. But ""there are so many moving parts,"" he said. ""If we have a reoccurrence of the pandemic and it comes on stronger, there is the potential of another dip"" in economic growth. 
The speed of the recovery will be important in determining whether the current recession has the same lasting impact as past downturns. The 2007 to 2009 recession, for example, was associated with a permanent loss of several hundred thousand blue-collar manufacturing jobs, sustained long-term unemployment, and years of weak wage growth for middle- and lower-income families.
The U.S. Federal Reserve meets this week, and officials will issue new economic projections that show how quick a recovery they expect.

Ireland is accelerating the cautious unwinding of its coronavirus lockdown with restaurants and hotels set to reopen on June 29 and pubs on June 20 with a pledge to review the social-distancing guidance.
Failte Ireland, the tourism authority, estimated 148,300 of the 260,000 workers in jobs supported by the hospitality sector before the lockdown would return if customers can be kept 1 metre apart, dropping to 63,200 if the 2 metre guidance remains.
Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has suggested a possible halving of the distance if coronavirus cases drop further. Health officials are developing specific guidance on the application of the rule for the hospitality sector during periods of low incidence of the disease.
Health Minister Simon Harris said on Monday the additional guidance will be finalised in the next week or two.
Ireland reported just nine new cases on Monday, the lowest daily tally since March 11, the day before it decided to close schools ahead of a full shutdown at the end of March.
A total of 1,683 people have died from just over 25,000 cases of COVID-19 in Ireland.

Lagarde was facing criticism from conservative lawmakers from the Netherlands and Germany at a hearing in the European Parliament, with one comparing her to the ill-fated French queen Marie Antoinette. 
The ECB's massive purchases of government bonds have already come under fire from Germany's Constitutional Court, which has given it three months to justify them or lose the German Bundesbank as the main buyer in its flagship debt-buying scheme.
Lagarde emphasised that the ECB took into account ""proportionality"" when making decisions and carried out a ""cost-benefit analysis"" -- two keywords from the German verdict.
""Our crisis-related measures are temporary, targeted and proportionate ... to the severe risks to our mandate that we are facing,"" Lagarde told EU lawmakers.
She said the ECB would assist the Bundesbank in addressing the court's concerns.
But Derk Jan Eppink, elected in the Netherlands for the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, said the ECB's massive debt purchases served the purpose of keeping southern countries afloat.
He peppered his remarks with references to Charles Dickens' novel David Copperfield, where a character ends up in prison after running up too much debt, and to Marie Antoinette, who was nicknamed 'Madame Déficit' and guillotined during the French Revolution after a life of opulence and excess.
""Had Charles Dickens lived today, he probably would describe you as 'la Marie Antoinette de la dette' (the Marie Antoinette of debt),"" he said.
The ECB expanded its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) to 1.35 trillion euros ($1.53 trillion ) last week and extended it at least until June 2021.
While the German court ruling refers to a different ECB bond-purchase scheme, Markus Kerber, one of the co-plaintiffs in the case, told Reuters on Friday that PEPP may fall foul of a ban on bankrolling governments.
Lagarde said in her testimony the ECB's policy would ""make sure that higher borrowing needs by fiscal authorities ... (will) not translate into materially higher interest rates for the private sector"".

The ECB gobbled up all of Italy's new debt in April and May but merely managed to keep the country's borrowing costs steady, data showed on Tuesday. Italy, already highly indebted, is among the countries worst-hit by the coronavirus.

The increase needs the approval of parliament.
The deficit had already been raised twice from the original plan of 40 billion crowns due to the economic slump caused by the coronavirus. The central state budget has borne the brunt of a drop in revenue and jump in spending in the public sector.
The 500 billion threshold would mean an overall public budget deficit getting into high single digits relative to gross domestic product, depending on how much nominal GDP falls this year from last year's 5.6 trillion crowns.
Public and private sector analysts polled by the Finance Ministry in May expected a GDP drop of around 7.6% in real terms this year, followed by a 5.8% growth next year.
The central European country had driven government debt down in the past years to 30.8% of GDP in 2019 versus an EU average of 79.3%, giving the government scope to borrow in the market for the time being.
It has sold record volumes of bonds in the past few months to build up a cash reserve.
Finance Minister Alena Schillerova had earlier signalled that a third increase in the 2020 gap would be necessary to keep the economy going.

The source asked not to be named because the restructuring talks are private, and highly sensitive as the country struggles to calm markets while negotiating new terms with bondholders.
Argentina is facing a grim economic picture after defaulting on its sovereign bonds last month.
Gross domestic product is seen shrinking 9.5% in 2020, according to a poll of analysts by the central bank released on Friday, versus an estimated 7% decline in the bank's previous monthly survey, as activity gets walloped by a nationwide lockdown that started March 20 to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
Striking a bond restructuring deal is key for the country to avoid years of legal battles with creditors and a potential shutout from global capital markets, as happened after a major default by the crisis-prone country in 2001.

1419,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 01:15PM ET</span>","Canadian banks' mortgage deferrals, at double the U.S. rate, likely to curb earnings","By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's top six banks have deferred mortgage repayments at nearly double the rate of their U.S. counterparts, setting themselves up for a tough slog to return to their pre-pandemic performance as higher household debt and insolvencies weigh on borrowing.
Even with about 16% of Canadian banks' mortgage books subject to deferrals https://tmsnrt.rs/3h42quj, many investors believe the C$11 billion ($8.2 billion) that lenders have set aside to cover potential loan losses are conservative, based on current economic assumptions.
(GRAPHIC - Canada mortgage deferrals: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/oakveqjwyvr/eikon.png) 
They are concerned, however, that elevated unemployment and an expected souring of many deferred mortgages currently marked as performing loans will cap future lending and hurt earnings growth in the next few years.
""There's going to be limited earnings growth coming through, if any"" until employment returns to about 80% to 90% of pre-coronavirus levels, said Sadiq Adatia, chief investment officer at Sun Life Global Investments.
Canada last week posted a surprise jobs gain in May, but the unemployment rate rose to 13.7%, sharply higher than February's 5.6%.
Despite a nearly six-fold rise in provisions in the April quarter, capital ratios fell by less than 40 basis points from the previous three months, helped by regulators' treatment of deferred mortgages as performing loans. 
That has diminished the risk of dividend cuts and capital increases, Adatia said.
Canadian banks provided six-month deferrals starting in mid-March to help tide customers over the economic crisis sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic. Come September, clients' balances will be adjusted to reflect the deferral amounts, which they will be required to pay over the course of their mortgage.
U.S. mortgage deferrals stood at 8.5% as of May 24, according to Mortgage Bankers' Association data, in part due to higher government unemployment benefits and additional stimulus payments regardless of employment status.
With Canada's household debt-to-GDP ratio rising to 101.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, making it among the highest in the developed world, the Bank of Canada warned last month that stretched consumers could remain frugal when pandemic-driven shutdowns are relaxed. [https:// Consumer insolvencies, which had been growing at the fastest pace since the global financial crisis even before the COVID-19 outbreak, slowed in March. But  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Mike Rizvanovic attributed the declines exclusively to pandemic-driven shutdowns, and predicted a ""sizeable backlog"" will begin to show up from June.  ""The significant deterioration in Canada's economy and labor market will drive insolvencies materially higher over the medium-term,"" weighing on banks' loan growth, he said in a note. Rizvanovic said bank earnings are unlikely to return to fiscal 2019 levels until 2023. Greg Taylor, chief investment officer of Purpose Investments, said banks have made an assumption that the situation will rebound quite quickly. 
If a recovery is slow to materialize and lenders extend deferrals, ""they'd have no choice but to increase provisions,"" he added, which would erode earnings.

1425,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>",World Bank says coronavirus to shrink 2020 global output by 5.2%,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The coronavirus will cause global economic output to contract by 5.2% in 2020, the World Bank said on Monday, warning that its latest forecasts would be revised downward if uncertainty over the pandemic and business lockdowns persist.
In its latest Global Economic Prospects report, the World Bank said that advanced economies are expected to shrink 7.0% in 2020, while emerging market economies will contract 2.5%, their first since aggregate data became available in 1960. On a per-capita GDP basis, the global contraction will be the deepest since 1945-46 as World War Two spending dried up.
The updated forecasts show more damage to the economy than estimates released in April by the International Monetary Fund, which predicted a 3.0% global contraction in 2020.
The IMF plans to update its forecasts on June 24 and Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has said that further cuts are ""very likely.""
World Bank officials said their baseline scenario assumes that social distancing lockdowns and temporary business closures begin to ease at the end of June.
But the report shows a downside scenario in which lockdowns are extended by three months this year. Should that occur, the 2020 contraction would deepen to 8% - 10% in advanced economies and 5% in emerging markets, with far more permanent business closures, a bigger collapse in global trade flows, layoffs and deep cuts in household spending.
""If that scenario materializes, the downside scenario, we are expecting a very sluggish recovery in 2021,"" World Bank Prospects Group Director Ayhan Kose told reporters. ""Global growth barely would begin to recover"" at around 1.3% next year.
The new forecasts also increased the World Bank's estimate of how many people will be pushed back into extreme poverty by the pandemic, to between 70 million and 100 million from a previous estimate of over 60 million.

The World Bank report showed 2020 contractions of 6.1% for the United States and Japan, a 9.1% contraction for the euro zone, 8.0% for Brazil and 3.2% for India. China is expected to maintain growth of 1.0% in 2020, down from a January forecast of 6.0%.

1426,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 11:18AM ET</span>",World Bank Forecasts Worst Recession in Eight Decades on Virus,"(Bloomberg) -- The global economy will contract the most since World War II this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, reducing incomes and sending millions of people into poverty in emerging and developing nations, the World Bank said.
Global gross domestic product will probably shrink 5.2% in 2020, the Washington-based development organization said in its semi-annual Global Economic Prospects report Monday.
That compares with a January projection for a 2.5% expansion and would be the fourth-deepest recession of the past 150 years after 1914, 1930-32 and 1945-46, the World Bank said. Per-capita output will contract in more than 90% of countries, the biggest share since 1870. The economy will rebound in 2021, growing 4.2%, it said.
“This is the first recession since 1870 triggered solely by a pandemic, and it continues to manifest itself,” Ceyla Pazarbazioglu, the World Bank’s vice president of equitable growth, finance and institutions, told reporters by phone. “Given this uncertainty, further downgrades to the outlook are very likely.”
The decline in per-capita income may push 70 million to 100 million people into extreme poverty, she said.
Advanced economies will shrink 7%, led by a 9.1% contraction in the euro area, the lender said. Emerging and developing economies will shrink 2.5%, their worst performance in data that starts in 1960, it said. Those with limited health-care capacity, deeply integrated global value chains, heavy dependence on foreign financing and extensive reliance on international trade, commodity exports and tourism are likely to be the hardest hit.
While the World Bank sees China’s economy eking out 1% growth this year, the lowest rate since 1976, it forecasts India’s will shrink 3.2%. U.S. GDP may contract 6.1%.
Two Scenarios
The World Bank presents two alternative scenarios. In one, where the Covid-19 outbreak persists for longer than expected, requiring the continuation or reintroduction of restrictions on movement, the global economy would shrink almost 8% this year. If control measures can be largely lifted in the near term, the contraction would be 4% -- still more than twice as deep as the global financial crisis of 2009.
“The global recession would be deeper if bringing the pandemic under control took longer than expected, or if financial stress triggered cascading defaults,” the World Bank said.
The International Monetary Fund will update its World Economic Outlook on June 24. In April, the fund forecast a 3% contraction for this year, though chief economist Gita Gopinath has since said that the outlook has worsened. The methodologies are different because IMF aggregate forecasts are based on purchasing-power parity, which gives more weight to developing economies, while the World Bank uses market exchange rates.
Most central banks have cut interest rates to about or below zero to buffer the effect of the coronavirus, with the Federal Reserve starting an unprecedented range of emergency programs providing as much as $2.3 trillion in loans. Fiscal-stimulus packages have varied. The U.S. is providing about 15% of GDP in support and Germany about 4.7%, while Japan’s program is worth about 42% of GDP, according to Bloomberg Economics.

1427,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>","Black, minority Britons hit hardest by COVID job losses, researchers say","LONDON (Reuters) - Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people in Britain have been hit harder by job losses during the coronavirus crisis than the population as a whole, researchers have found.
The share of BAME people in employment fell to 67.4% in April from 72.0% in February, researchers from the University of Essex and other academic centres said.
That was a bigger drop than a decline to 79.4% from 81.1% for non-BAME people, they said, using data from the long-running Understanding Society survey led by the University of Essex.
People from ethnic minorities also face higher health risks from COVID-19, previously published research has shown. Black and Asian people in England are up to 50% more likely to die after being infected, an official study said last week.
The report comes as the global protests at the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis have put renewed focus on the wider economic inequalities facing non-white people.
The research, which was first published on June 1, showed that fewer BAME people who reported a decline in hours worked had been put on the government's coronavirus job retention scheme than non-BAME people in the same situation.
That scheme provides 80% of the wages of employees who are temporarily laid off.
""The BAME group is very heterogeneous and many questions remain unanswered,"" Paul Fisher, one of the academics who worked on the report, said.
""Which communities are being hardest hit? Can the different types of jobs done by different workers explain the pattern? These are questions which urgently need answering and further research is needed.""
U.S. data published last week showed joblessness among African Americans and Asians rose even as the overall unemployment rate dropped unexpectedly in May.
The study showed bigger increases of BAME people who were in arrears on their bills after seeing their incomes fall, and they were also more likely to have borrowed money as a way to mitigate their earnings losses.

The research showed that people with less education also suffered a bigger fall in employment than people with more qualifications. But the difference was not as marked as between BAME and non-BAME people.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's economy may shrink less than feared this year, but the recession will nevertheless be about three times as bad as the record contraction of 2009 at the height of the global financial crisis, the central bank said on Monday.
The economy could contract by 9% to 11.6% in 2020 as the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic hits the tourism-dependent country more than others in Europe, the central bank said regarding what it sees as the most likely case.
The Bank of Spain's previous central scenario was for a 9.5% to 12.4% contraction. Spain's economy shrank by 3.7% in 2009.
The impact of a lockdown that started in mid-March will be fully felt in the second quarter, with a contraction likely around 16% to 21.8%, the central bank said.
The first quarter's 5.2% contraction was already the sharpest drop since the historical series began in 1970 and twice as much as the worst quarter of 2009.
""In the short term, the Spanish economy is going to contract further. It will take a little longer to recover the economic dynamism, but in 2021 the recovery will be a little more intense than in the euro zone average,"" Oscar Arce, the Bank of Spain's director general for economics, told a news briefing. 
The central bank sees the economy starting to recover in the second part of the year, with GDP likely to bounce back in 2021 and grow by 7.7% to 9.1% from a previous estimate by the central bank of 6.1% to 8.5%. 
The economic projections come a few days after the European Central Bank said it expected the euro zone to shrink by 8.7% this year in a baseline scenario.
The Spanish central bank also included a more severe and less-likely horizon where the economy could fall by up to 15.1% in 2020 as it cannot rule ""more adverse scenarios"" due to uncertainty over a hypothetical new wave of coronavirus.
As the world economies are taking on more debt to fight off the consequences from the COVID-19 fallout, both public debt and deficit figures are rising.
The Bank of Spain expected the country's debt-to-GDP ratio to rise up to 119.3% in 2020 and the deficit to grow up to 11.2% this year from 2.8% in 2019.

LONDON (Reuters) - More than a third of the fish stocks around the world are being overfished and the problem is particularly acute in developing countries, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in a report on Monday.
The FAO said in a biennial report that tackling the issue would require several measures including stronger political will and improved monitoring as fish stocks in areas with less-developed management were in poor shape.
""While developed countries are improving the way they manage their fisheries, developing countries face a worsening situation,"" the FAO said.
In 2017, 34.2% of the fish stocks of the world's marine fisheries were classified as overfished, a ""continuous increasing trend"" since 1974 when it stood at just 10%.
Overfishing depletes stocks at a rate that the species cannot replenish and so leads to lower fish populations and reduced future production.
The FAO said less intense management was common in many developing nations and was fuelled partly by limited management and governance capacities.
""We notice that sustainability is particularly difficult in places where hunger, poverty and conflict exist, but there is no alternative to sustainable solutions,"" the agency said.
Worldwide per capita fish consumption set a new record of 20.5 kg per year in 2018 and has risen by an average rate of 3.1% since 1961, outpacing all other animal proteins.
Fish consumption accounts for a sixth of the global population's intake of animal proteins, and more than half in countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, the Gambia, Ghana, Indonesia, Sierra Leone and Sri Lanka.
The FAO projected global per capita consumption would climb to 21.5 kg by 2030, a slowdown in the average annual growth rate to 0.4%, with a decline expected in Africa.
""The main reason for this decline is the growth of Africa's population outpacing the growth in supply. Increasing domestic production and higher fish imports will not be sufficient to meet the region's growing demand,"" the FAO said.

The report is based on information gathered before the COVID-19 outbreak which has led to a decline in global fishing activity as a result of restrictions and labour shortages due to the health emergency, the FAO said. [L8N2CT6Q8]

1443,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Dutch economy set to shrink at record pace in 2020: central bank,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Dutch economy in 2020 is expected to shrink at the fastest rate recorded in peacetime as lockdowns have crippled production and exports and are set to send unemployment to the highest level in years, the Dutch central bank said on Monday.
The euro zone's fifth largest economy would shrink an unprecedented 6.4% this year, even if the gradual easing of measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak continues in the coming months, the DNB said.
Growth is expected to resume at 2.9% and 2.4% respectively in 2021 and 2022, still leaving the economy slightly smaller than before the pandemic erupted.
But any second wave of coronavirus infections and a renewed shutdown of major parts of the economy, either in the Netherlands or abroad, could easily lead to a much bleaker scenario, the DNB said.
""A 6.4% contraction is already twice as much as we saw during the financial crisis,"" DNB director Olaf Sleijpen told reporters in a video conference. 
""But there is much uncertainty. The depth of the recession and the strength of the comeback depend on developments which are hard to estimate right now. Downside risks prevail.""
In its bleakest scenario, the DNB said the Dutch economy would shrink 11.8% this year and would remain far from its pre-coronavirus levels until at least well into 2023, adding that even this estimate could turn out to be too rosy.
In every scenario unemployment, historically low until recently, is set to rise rapidly throughout this year and next, peaking between 6% and 9% in 2021.

Lockdown measures in the Netherlands have gradually been relaxed in recent weeks, after a mid-March shutdown of all schools, restaurants, bars, museums and other public places.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico is facing its deepest recession in decades and prominent investors believe it could soon follow state oil company Pemex in seeing its credit rating relegated to ""junk"" territory as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on.
Losing the investment-grade rating that Latin America's second-largest economy has held for almost two decades would be a bitter blow for leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
His fiscally conservative approach to finance and debt is guided by memories of Mexico's humiliating payments crises and bailouts in the 1980s and 1990s.
""Losing the investment grade rating is a real risk and now something investors increasingly think about,"" said Luis Gonzali, a portfolio manager at asset manager Franklin Templeton. 
""It could be the event that defines the presidency of Lopez Obrador and leads to investors fleeing Mexico fast, and at a large scale."" 
Analysts at JP Morgan said Mexico's big presence in major investment grade bond indices would exacerbate the scale of forced selling if it becomes a ""fallen angel,"" a company or country whose ratings have been cut to below investment-grade.
All three ratings agencies have already downgraded Mexico this year. 
Fitch Ratings has its sovereign bonds at BBB-, with a stable outlook; Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Services has them at Baa1 and S&P Global Ratings at BBB, both with negative outlooks, signaling further downgrades. 
Two would have to rate Mexico speculative grade, or junk, for it to become official. 
JP Morgan analysts wrote in a research note that an estimated $44.3 billion of Mexican bonds are at risk of forced selling in the event of a cut to junk.
About $4.5 billion of that total is corporate debt, they said, noting that a sovereign downgrade makes it harder for companies to hold an investment grade rating.
Gonzali estimated the junk label could initially push up borrowing costs for the Mexican government by as much as 300 basis points before settling at around 100 basis points higher than now.
FRUGAL WAYS
Mexico was long a darling of investors as it reduced the role of the state and appointed U.S-trained technocrats attuned to Wall Street's preferences to reduce the state's role in the economy. 
But its star was fading even before Lopez Obrador's 2018 election win.
Despite his frugal ways since taking office, policy decisions including cancellations of billions of dollars of infrastructure projects and the renegotiation of energy contracts have further eroded trust.
Concerns are also growing within the finance ministry, where one official said further downgrades were likely with a cut to junk possible as early as next year.
""The outlook for Mexico's sovereign debt is very negative,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""The problem is that there's now a confidence crisis in the politics of the government.""
JP Morgan's analysts agreed that a downgrade to speculative grade could happen late next year or in early 2022. 
They cited low growth and the state's crowding out of investors in the energy sector among factors undermining Mexico's coveted investment grade. They also cited slow progress in diversifying the tax base, and a weak response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Investors already rate Mexican sovereign bonds similar to junk, with spreads to U.S. Treasuries climbing.
(GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/373EN08)
The spread has moved ""into the pricing range of a security on the cusp of downgrade to high yield,"" said Andrew Stanners, an investment director at asset manager Aberdeen Standard.
Carlos Serrano, an economist at BBVA (MC:BBVA), the country's largest bank, noted the market priced Mexico's last sovereign bond issue at a level similar to that of junk-rated Paraguay.
Mexico issued $2.5 billion in April at a yield to maturity of 5%, Serrano said, while Paraguay issued $2 billion the same month, and with a similar maturity, at a yield to maturity of 4.95%.
Not all feel a downgrade to junk is inevitable, however. 
""The decision not to be fiscally expansive could pay off if we get a very quick recovery,"" said Stanners, referring to the lack of government spending to offset the pandemic's economic impact.

""It'll mean that the fiscal position has not been eroded as harshly as other countries and could prevent rating downgrades to high yield.""

Le Pen's heavily indebted party took out the 9 million euro loan at the First Czech Russian Bank six years ago as it sought to raise financing in preparation for her 2017 presidential run. Western banks were rebuffing the party's approaches, she said at the time.
The First Czech Russian Bank has since had its operating licence revoked because it held insufficient capital. 
A Russian company called Aviazapchast, which specialises in the sale of aircraft parts, had acquired the claim to the National Rally loan, according to court documents. Aviazapchast filed a lawsuit against Le Pen's party in December last year.
Documents published by the Moscow Arbitration Court on Sunday showed that the two parties reached a voluntary settlement agreement last week. 
The court's decision said Aviazapchast was withdrawing its demand for the early repayment of the entire loan, as well as some penalties imposed against the French party. 
The court decision also outlined a timeline for the repayment of the debt in instalments until 2028.
Two French banks closed accounts belonging to Le Pen and her party six months after her election defeat to Emmanuel Macron. The banks said they had acted within regulatory requirements. 
During her 2017 campaign, Le Pen, who has said she is an admirer of President Vladimir Putin, promised a softer line on Russia, urging the West to drop economic sanctions on Moscow.

Investing.com -- ECB head Christine Lagarde will face a grilling about the latest largess from the central bank, while Wall Street is set to open higher, continuing the recent positive trend. Crude oil posted more gains as major producers agreed to limit output for another month, while speculation has emerged about a huge meger in the healthcare sector. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, June 8th.
1. ECB head Lagarde faces questions
All eyes will be on European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde later Monday as she testifies, via satellite link, before the European Parliament Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.
Lawmakers will have the opportunity to ask questions about the reasons behind the ECB’s larger-than-expected increase in its emergency bond buying stimulus program. Investors will be looking for clues on whether the ECB plans to ease monetary policy even further.
The ECB padded its emergency bond-buying fund by another 600 billion euros ($680 billion) at its meeting last Thursday, and it’s easy to see why given the depth of the region’s slowdown illustrated by the almost 18% slump in Germany’s industrial production data in April.
However, she could face some tricky questions over this additional stimulus after the German top court ruling that the European Central Bank abused its power in earlier bond purchases.
2. Talk of mega-healthcare merger
AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), the British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, approached U.S. rival Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) about a potential tie-up last month, according to a report by Bloomberg over the weekend.
Such a deal would result in the biggest healthcare merger to date, creating a partnership worth around 200 billion pounds ($250 billion).
The two companies are among a host of firms racing to develop a vaccine for Covid-19, while Gilead’s antiviral drug Remdesivir is seen as a leading treatment for patients suffering from the effects of the virus.
Both companies have declined to comment on the report, but doubts exist as to the likelihood of this tie-up now as AstraZeneca’s valuation could soar given its collaboration with researchers at Oxford University put it at the forefront of the search for a vaccine.
3. OPEC+ agrees extension to record production cuts
Crude oil prices pushed higher Monday after a group of major producers agreed to extend a deal on record output cuts to the end of July.
Sentiment in the oil market has changed sharply since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia - collectively known as OPEC+ - agreed in April to cut supply by 9.7 million barrels per day during May-June to prop up prices that collapsed due to the coronavirus crisis.
On Saturday, the group agreed to extend the deal by a third month to the end of July. 
The extension had been delayed by the worries of some of the bigger producers, namely Saudi Arabia and Russia, that other countries were playing fast and loose with compliance.
Iraq and Nigeria exceeded production quotas in May and June, but they have agreed to slightly deeper cuts to compensate for their failure to the original agreement.
Investor sentiment also got a boost from Sunday’s Chinese customs data which indicated that the country’s crude imports soared to 11.34 barrels a day, 15% more than April, a positive indication of China’s recovery from the Covid-19 virus.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 0.8% at $39.68 a barrel, while the global benchmark Brent was up 1.2% at $42.82 a barrel.
4. Stocks set to open higher, continuing recent gains 
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher, continuing to push higher as optimism grows about the rebounding of the economy from the shutdown needed to combat the Covid-19  virus.
By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 futures contract was up 141 points or 0.5%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was up 0.4% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.1%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 cash indices are now trading at 3.5 month highs, having posted gains for three straight weeks, while the NASDAQ Composite posted an all-time intraday high on Friday.
Friday’s shock gain in payrolls has boosted hope of a V-shaped economic recovery. Adding to the positive news is that New York City, seen as the epicenter of the virus outbreak in the U.S., is to begin its phase one reopening  Monday.
This all puts the spotlight on the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy announcement on Wednesday. 
5. Musk doubles down on SpaceX
Elon Musk is in the spotlight again. 
Fresh from his SpaceX company launching astronauts for the first time just a few days ago, Musk has urged his SpaceX employees to accelerate progress on its next-generation Starship rocket “dramatically and immediately,” in a company-wide email seen by CNBC.
Musk’s goal is to make Starship fully reusable, becoming more like a commercial airplane with short turnaround times between flights, making it more commercially viable.
This is all very exciting, but is there a danger Musk loses focus regarding his Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) electric car company?

Local governments are asked to step up management of their debts, the meeting said, according to a statement on the finance ministry's website.

1449,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>",U.S. Fed's Main Street lending facility likely to start with a whimper,"By Jonnelle Marte and Michelle Price
(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's most ambitious and complicated crisis relief program is set to launch in coming days but it is far from certain that the small and mid-sized businesses the $600 billion ""Main Street Lending Facility"" is meant to help will come clamoring for loans. 
Two months into the economic crisis spurred by the novel coronavirus pandemic, some lobbyists, bankers and small business consultants say the loans may be too large to help many struggling businesses and some borrowers are worried about coming under public scrutiny. 
Some lenders also say they are concerned about the balance sheet risks they could face by participating. 
""From our lenders, I'm seeing very limited interest because of the large minimum loan size of a half million,"" said Paul Merski, an executive vice president at the Independent Community Bankers (NASDAQ:ESXB) of America.
The program aims to provide credit to businesses that are too large for the Paycheck Protection Program, which targets companies with fewer than 500 employees, and too small to directly benefit from the Fed's corporate bond buying programs. 
As with the PPP, the Main Street facility loans will be distributed via participating banks, but unlike the PPP those loans are not forgivable and will have to be repaid.
The program, which is being administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, will lend to U.S. businesses with up to 15,000 employees or revenues capped at $5 billion. Loans can range in size from $500,000 to $200 million. Borrowers have four years to repay the loans, with no payments due the first year and no penalty on prepayment.
The Main Street program is part of the federal government's unprecedented effort to shore-up the U.S. economy and help companies retain workers after the coronavirus shutdown put more than 20 million Americans out of work.
Data from the 2017 Census business survey suggests more than 38,000 companies employing about 30.2 million people could make use of the program, including more than half of the S&P 500. 
""It is far and away the biggest challenge of any of the 11 facilities that we've set up,"" Fed chair Jerome Powell said last month during a Princeton University webcast in which he also said the central bank is open to adjusting the program.
UNWELCOME SCRUTINY
With Congress ramping up scrutiny of bailout funds, the Main Street program has already attracted controversy. In April, lawmakers accused the Fed of bowing to the oil and gas lobby after the central bank changed the facility's terms to better accommodate highly indebted industries.
Since then, many companies have grown wary of the scrutiny that comes with tapping federal aid, especially after many publicly-listed companies were widely criticized for taking PPP loans, according to bankers and lobbyists.
The Fed plans to publish the names of lenders and borrowers, the amounts borrowed and interest rates charged, along with other details.
""There's the potential for future scrutiny with hindsight that we don't have today,"" said Matt Kulkin, co-chair of the financial services group at Steptoe & Johnson. 
He added that some businesses may also hold off from applying until they get clarity on the conditions the Fed will impose on borrowers, in particular a requirement that companies make ""a reasonable effort"" to retain workers. 
Other limits on executive compensation, dividends or stock buybacks will also put some companies off, said Kulkin.
LOAN SIZES TOO LARGE
The Fed expanded the program in April after receiving more than 2,200 comment letters by lowering the minimum loan amount to $500,000 from $1 million and by raising the cap on employees and revenue. But some small banks say they are likely to sit the program out because its loan sizes are still too large. 
The ICBA and American Bankers Association had pushed for the minimum loan size to be no more than $100,000. 
""I still don't understand why a minimum is even needed,"" tweeted Jill Castilla, President and CEO of Citizens Bank of Edmond in Oklahoma last month regarding the facility. 
Large and small banks are also worried about the risks they could face. The Fed will purchase 85% or 95% of qualifying loans, depending on the type, and the bank will keep the rest of the loan on its balance sheet. 
Because they are taking on some of the risk, banks can set their own underwriting standards but even holding 5%-15% of a loan in a troubled business may be too much, said bankers and lobbyists.

""It may be something that the largest banks and businesses will take up but really the loan terms may need to be adjusted for a more robust participation,"" said Merski.

1450,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 06:11AM ET</span>","Fed says beating pandemic is key, but how will it know things are better?","By Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With a full three months of responding to a global pandemic under their belt, U.S. Federal Reserve officials have united around one point: lasting progress on the economic front will be dictated by success in containing the spread of the coronavirus.
But agreement beyond that may be elusive as Fed policymakers meet this week to balance fresh signs the United States may be over the worst of the economic fallout from the pandemic against evidence the virus is not yet under control.
A surprise gain of more than 2.5 million U.S. jobs last month will factor into their debate, as will any hint the surge in employment and other activity more broadly is accompanied by more transmission of the novel coronavirus.
Where they end up could shape decisions about whether to expand or create new emergency programs in anticipation of a more extended economic crisis, or about how to best support companies and households if in fact the pandemic is easing.
The U.S. central bank has ongoing debates on each front, both about the long-run commitments it might make to anchor interest rates at a low level for the recovery, and the continued hunt, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell put it last week, for companies with substantial numbers of employees that have not been covered in any of the crisis programs launched so far.
The stunning May payrolls data released by the Labor Department on Friday could temper some of the urgency that has accompanied Fed meetings since March. [nL1N2DH2GS]
After having cut interest rates to near zero and launched a bevy of credit programs in a frenzy of emergency meetings in March, no major policy decisions are expected on Wednesday when the Federal Open Market Committee ends its latest two-day meeting. It is scheduled to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday and Powell is due to hold a news conference shortly after. 
Policymakers, however, will issue economic projections for the first time since December, before a decade-long economic expansion was snuffed out by a massive wave of unemployment that followed widespread lockdowns to stop the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus.
Projections due in March were shelved because there was so much fog around the collapsing economy that policymakers felt it pointless to guess where unemployment, inflation and economic growth were headed.
Three months of data since have verified the scope of the crisis - unemployment may have fallen in May but remains at a Great Depression-like 13.3%. And while it does appear the worst in terms of joblessness may have been reached, Oxford Economics economist Bob Schwartz cautioned on Friday that ""the remarkable turnaround last month reflected the easy-lifting part of the healing process.""
Furthermore, what remains unknown is perhaps what matters most - the extent to which durable progress has been made in containing a health crisis in which more than 110,000 Americans have died.
Deaths and the rise in new cases, which had been declining on a moving average basis, have recently risen. The easing of restrictions on business and social gatherings, meanwhile, has led to concerns about a possible wave of new infections. Such fears were heightened late last month as Americans flocked to beaches and lakes to celebrate the Memorial Day long weekend.
Two weeks of protests across the nation over the death of George Floyd, an African-American man who died in police custody in Minneapolis, have added even more uncertainty in major cities, including some that seemingly had the virus under control.
For the Fed, how to make sense of it all has become an impressionistic test, with policymakers looking at the same set of information and seeing different trajectories.
Asked about the scenes of Memorial Day revelers at one Missouri lake resort, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he thought the risk of a second large wave of infections was low because of an expected quick response by health authorities. 
""This is not occurring in a vacuum,"" he told journalists on the Wednesday after the holiday weekend.
That same day, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he was paying particular heed ""to congregations happening in ways that ... will potentially lead to a second wave that induces another shutdown. If that happens I think there are significant concerns"" about the economic recovery.
CLARITY SLOW IN COMING
The economic projections released on Wednesday will offer a key insight into how Fed officials see the pandemic's trajectory and whether they think the economy has hit bottom.
The Fed has not tried to establish its own central system for monitoring or recreating health data, but pulled extensively from the publicly available information, consultations with outside experts, and a massive amount of background reading.
""We are not experts on epidemiology, the spread of pandemics or anything like that,"" Powell said in an online event in late May. ""We talk to experts, and the main answer they give you is things are highly uncertain.""
Even experts are struggling over measuring the fight against the pandemic with testing levels still insufficient to fully describe how the health crisis is evolving.
In a recent paper, Jeffrey Harris, a physician and economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, noted the main methods for tracking progress against the virus had all failed in one jurisdiction or another.
""We will have more than a few problems trying to determine whether various state governments' efforts to rekindle economic and social activity have been working or failing,"" Harris wrote. ""Imagine trying to bring a plane to a soft landing when you don't really know its altitude or velocity.""
The pace for lifting restrictions isn't up to the Fed, and policymakers say the strength of a recovery will depend on whether people feel safe again in stores and offices. 
A second wave of infections could wreck that process.
The Fed may not know for sure if it's coming, but Powell said late last month that it would respond if it does.

""There is clearly a risk of a second outbreak, and that would be challenging,"" Powell said. ""We, of course, would continue to react ... We are not close to any limits.""

1451,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>",Scarred and scared: post-Covid consumers not their old selves,"By Mark John
LONDON (Reuters) - Michael Clark of Amy's Housewares has one big fear as its London stores prepare to reopen on June 15 along with other retailers around Britain: ""Customers not spending, having no trust in the economy.""
His concern, captured in a survey by the British Independent Retailers Association (BIRA) before a nationwide easing of social distancing measures, may be well founded.
Across the world, consumers are emerging from lockdowns warier and more thrift-conscious than before. That will drag on any recovery and could encourage governments and central bankers to follow up on coronavirus handouts with more costly stimulus.
The new thrift is showing up in various ways: some households are hoarding the cash they saved during lockdowns; some are flocking to cheaper brands or sticking with essentials. 
GRAPHIC: Savings rates in Europe rise Savings rates in Europe rise - https://graphics.reuters.com/ECONOMY-EU/SAVINGS/yxmvjkqlnpr/chart.png 
Other risks to consumer demand include the outright collapse of purchasing power among those whose livelihoods were ruined by the pandemic and even imponderables such as what happens to spending patterns if more people continue to work from home.
In China, shopping malls began to fill up again from April after lockdown eased. Online sales have surged in some categories, often helped by discounts and state coupons.
But a lingering wariness about items deemed non-essential means consumers may still not emerge as the pillar of growth which Beijing hopes they will be.
""Consumers are placing a greater focus on essential spending categories,"" Fitch Solutions said in a June 4 report, predicting a fall in Chinese household spending this year and slashing its 2020 growth forecast to just 1.1% from 5.6% before the pandemic.
DOLLAR STORE CLIENTELE GROWS
In the United States, commonplace brands such as chocolate giant Hershey or toothpaste-maker Colgate say consumers have traded down. Dollar stores, meanwhile, expect to open their doors to a new set of customers as they did after the 2008-09 Great Recession.
""In 2008, folks lost jobs ... and they found us. And I think that's some of what we're planning for as we take a look into our crystal ball at back half of the year and 2021,"" Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) Chief Executive Gary Philbin said on May 28.
Much hangs now on what happens to the mountain of savings built up by those U.S. households which weathered the worst of the lockdown fall-out and have pushed the overall U.S. savings rate to a record 33% of income.
GRAPHIC: Savings rates in the U.S. rise - https://graphics.reuters.com/ECONOMY-USA/SAVINGS/nmovakbjdva/chart.png 
While that rate will fall, those who expect cash to flood back into the economy may be disappointed. A 2012 paper by IMF researchers found that lingering uncertainty after the onset of the 2008-09 recession boosted saving rates durably, leading to lower consumption and growth in the wider economy.
Moreover many U.S. households are about to suffer ""income cliffs"" with one-off tax rebates expiring in May and pandemic unemployment compensation ending in July, Oxford Economics said, forecasting lower household income through the rest of the year.
""This will likely act as a constraint on the consumer spending recovery well into 2021,"" it said in a June 3 note. 
Such a scenario could force policy makers across the world to encourage savers to spend by speeding up moves to ease lockdowns, offering more economic support or pushing interest rates further towards, and even into, negative territory.
The same dilemma exists in Europe. The European Central Bank expects household savings to rise six points to 19% of income this year and remain high next year due to what economists call ""scarring"", when an event leaves a durable impact on behaviour.
Citing the risk of cash-hoarding, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called for direct incentives to boost demand. The budget he will present next week will forecast a drop in consumer spending of 10% this year as households amass savings.
Germany has announced a cut in valued-added tax for the second half of the year to drive consumption, coupling that with cash handouts to parents.
Presenting hefty downgrades of the bank's eurozone growth protections on Thursday, ECB President Christine Lagarde said the depth of scarring of domestic demand was one big factor that will determine the size of the contraction and recovery to come.

She warned: ""Overall, the (ECB) Governing Council sees the balance of risks ... to the downside.""

1452,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>","China's new yuan loans expected to fall in May, policy support intact: Reuters poll","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's new bank loans are expected to decline in May from the previous month, but are still expected to be higher than a year earlier amid continued policy support to bolster the economy against the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Chinese banks are estimated to have issued 1.50 trillion yuan ($211.84 billion) in net new yuan loans in May, compared with 1.70 trillion yuan in April, according to the median estimate in a Reuters survey of 33 economists.
That would be higher than 1.18 trillion yuan in new loans a year earlier. 
Pan Gongsheng, Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China (OTC:BACHY), said last week that the economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic was bigger than first expected and that more monetary and credit policy support was needed.
China made no annual growth target this year for the first time since 2002 and pledged more government spending as the COVID-19 pandemic hammers the world's second-biggest economy.
Premier Li Keqiang told parliament last month that d monetary policy would be more flexible, and growth of M2 - a broad gauge of money supply - and total social financing would be significantly higher this year.
Broad M2 money supply growth in May was seen at 11.3%, versus 11.1% growth in the previous month.
From June 1, the central bank started buying 400 billion yuan of loans made by local lenders to small firms to encourage banks to lend as much as 1 trillion yuan. It will also provide 40 billion yuan in funds to help banks extend loans with a principal value of about 3.7 trillion yuan.
Li said last month the government would extend loan payments for small and micro-sized business until the end of March next year. 
The central bank has rolled out easing steps since early February including cuts in reserve requirements and lending rates and targeted lending support for firms hit hard by the impact of the pandemic.
Beijing has been leaning more heavily on fiscal stimulus to weather the downturn, cutting taxes and issuing local government bonds to fund infrastructure projects. 
The government has set a 2020 budget deficit of at least 3.6% of GDP, up from last year's 2.8%, and fixed the quota on local government special bond issuance at 3.75 trillion yuan, up from 2.15 trillion yuan.
The government will also issue 1 trillion yuan in special treasury bonds this year. 
Local governments issued 2.15 trillion yuan in special bonds in the first five months of this year, the finance ministry has said. 
Any acceleration in bond issuance could help boost total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity.
TSF is expected to fall slightly to 3.00 trillion yuan in May from 3.09 trillion yuan in April.
Annual outstanding yuan loans are expected to grow 13.2% for May, faster than 13.1% growth for April.

1453,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 04:25AM ET</span>",HK residents rush for offshore bank accounts on China law worries: sources,"By Clare Jim and Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Banks including HSBC,  Standard Chartered  (OTC:SCBFF) and  Citigroup  have seen a spike in enquiries from Hong Kong residents about opening offshore accounts amid concerns stemming from China's decision to impose a national security law on the city, five people said.
HSBC (L:HSBA) and Standard Chartered (L:STAN) have each seen a 25-30% jump in enquiries, two of the people said. All five have direct knowledge about the rise in interest but did not want to be named as they were not authorized to speak to media. 
The queries add to concerns about capital flight from the Asian financial hub, which has been roiled by pro-democracy protests in the past year, and underline worries about the liquidity of assets as the new law inflames Sino-U.S. tensions.
President Donald Trump has said he will strip Hong Kong of its special status under U.S. law if China moves ahead with the law that aims to curb sedition, secession, terrorism and foreign interference.
""What I'm worried about the most is I might not be able to freely exchange Hong Kong dollar anymore if the U.S. decided to sanction Hong Kong,"" said 39-year-old May Chan, who recently asked HSBC about opening an offshore account.
The city's de facto central bank has sought to allay concerns, saying it has all the means necessary to defend the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the greenback.
None of the leading global retail banks with operations in the Chinese-ruled city have seen large outflow of deposits in the last two weeks, said two of the sources, noting it can take at least a month to open an offshore account.
But the rise in enquiries has been strong enough to slow banks' response times, the sources said, adding places including Singapore, Britain, Sydney and Taiwan, are popular destinations. 
Chan was told by HSBC she would have to wait a month just to get information about opening an offshore account.
She has already changed 70% of her savings into foreign currencies including U.S. dollar and British pound. 
""If things get messy here I might not even be able to transfer my money out in the worst-case scenario, so it's good to diversify risks.""
NO NOTICEABLE CAPITAL OUTFLOWS
While authorities insist the legislation will target only a small number of ""troublemakers"", critics say it could erode the high degree of autonomy of the former British colony.
Many Hong Kong residents are renewing their British National Overseas passport, after the proposed new law prompted Britain to offer a potential refuge to the almost 3 million eligible for it. 
""Now is the second wave of opening offshore accounts; the first wave was after June last year during the protests,"" said one of the sources, referring to the sometimes violent unrest against a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed people to be extradited to the mainland.
HSBC declined to comment on offshore account enquiries, but a spokeswoman said the bank ""had not seen any signs of significant outflows.""
A Standard Chartered spokeswoman said there had been enquiries about offshore accounts, but it had ""not seen any noticeable capital outflows"".
A Citigroup (N:C) spokesman said the bank had seen a pick up in local account openings as Hong Kong lifted coronavirus-related curbs, but it had not seen capital outflows or a rise in offshore account openings.

1454,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 03:55AM ET</span>",Jobs come first in South Korea's ambitious 'Green New Deal' climate plan,"By Josh Smith and Sangmi Cha
SEOUL (Reuters) - The first stages of a South Korean government “Green New Deal” aiming to retool one of the world’s most fossil fuel-reliant economies is focused instead on protecting jobs as the country seeks to stimulate a virus-ravaged economy, activists say.
First proposed by President Moon Jae-in's ruling party ahead of the April parliamentary election, the Green New Deal set ambitious goals of net-zero emissions by 2050, an end to financing of overseas coal plants, and the introduction of a carbon tax.
But activists say that government plans announced since then do not directly address Moon's pledge to reach net-zero emissions, or to end to coal financing.
An initial parliamentary proposal calls for an investment of 12.9 trillion won ($10.5 billion) over the next two years, with the focus on the creation of 133,000 jobs.
The plan includes remodelling public buildings, creating urban forests, recycling, establishing a foundation for new and renewable energy, and creating low-carbon energy industrial complexes to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. 
Those proposals look ""like a repackaging of already existing plans and policies,"" Kim Joo-jin, managing director of Solutions For Our Climate (SFOC), a Seoul-based non-profit organisation, said in a statement.
""There is quite a large gap between international praise of Korea's Green New Deal and the reality on the ground,"" he said.
Lee So-young, who was elected to parliament this year on a platform of environmental reform, acknowledged the concerns but said lawmakers are seeking to draft more detailed laws that will not only not boost the economy after the coronavirus crisis, but also transform the economy and society in more sustainable ways.
The jobs-heavy proposals are a first, short-term phase designed to help shore up the economy after the coronavirus crisis, she told Reuters.""Green New Deal legislation is not simply a matter of injecting funding in certain projects, but rather addressing what kind of procedure, governance and regulations we will use to remodel the entire society by 2050 to prevent climate change,"" Lee said.
DIFFICULT TRANSITIONS
Lee vowed that in the long run, the New Green Deal won't simply be old policies that have been ""green washed.""
A more long-term plan will need to be drafted to regulate and end financing for coal plants, impose phased carbon taxes, increase ""energy welfare"" for people suffering from the effects of climate change, and to reduce overall air pollution, she said.
In 2017, the last year for which data was available, South Korea was the 7th largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
Coal power is the bedrock of South Korea's electricity supply, accounting for about 40% of the country's total energy mix, with renewable power accounting for less than 6%. 
With the economic woes that are being exacerbated by the COVID-19 crisis, Moon's administration has continued to subsidize and bail out companies like Doosan Heavy, which builds power stations in South Korea and overseas.
But the wide victory margins for Moon's party in the April parliamentary election, and an appetite for progress on climate, reinforces that view that voters in Asia’s developed economies and regions now equate environmental performance with government competence, said Melissa Brown, director of Asia Energy Policy Studies at the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

""Voters want their children to have clean air and water,"" she said. ""They associate environmental problems with corruption and lazy politicians.""

1456,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 02:21AM ET</span>",Coronavirus widens the cracks in Egypt's cement industry,"CAIRO (Reuters) - The coronavirus is putting Egypt's private cement industry under even more pressure.
Already scrambling to respond to competition from a vast new factory owned by the military, the pandemic has stymied a nascent rebound in sales, raising the possibility of plant closures, industry executives and analysts say.
Demand for cement in Egypt was on the decline when the military opened a $1 billion factory in 2018 that added 13 million tonnes of annual capacity, on top of the country's existing 79 million tonnes. 
The plant in Beni Suef, 200 km (125 miles) south of Cairo, has compounded a difficult market for foreign firms that spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying cement factories during a wave of privatisations in the late 1990s and early 2000s. 
The pandemic, however, has made the economics even worse and could lead to four or five closures among the country's roughly two dozen plants in the coming months, according to one senior company official, who declined to be named because he was not authorised to talk to the media.
Foreign cement firms in Egypt include Germany's HeidelbergCement (DE:HEIG), France's  Vicat  (PA:VCTP), Switzerland's LafargeHolcim (S:LHN), Greece's Titan Cement (BR:TITC) and Mexico's CEMEX (MX:CEMEXCPO).
LafargeHolcim, Vicat and CEMEX did not respond to requests for comment. Titan said it was happy with its Egyptian investment and it saw a 5% increase in volume in the first quarter despite the coronavirus lockdown measures.
Lorenz Naeger, the chief financial officer of HeidelbergCement told the company's annual meeting last week that sales in Egypt had been well below expectations. 
""Several players are in deep distress today as most producers are generating losses at the gross and EBITDA level and balance sheets are in bad shape in some cases,"" said Yousef Husseini, analyst at EFG Hermes.
""There is an expectation that some plants will have to close in the coming years as the economics just don't make sense.""
Overall demand for cement rose 8% in January and 9% in February 2020 from a year earlier but then fell 3% in March and 8% in April as the coronavirus crisis kicked in, said a second company official, citing government figures. 
Official data for March and April have yet to be released.
The state press centre and the military did not respond to a request for comment about the impact of the virus and the military-owned plant on the cement industry.
Of the seven cement companies listed on the local stock market, only two eked out a profit in 2019, in both cases much reduced from 2018.
A government official didn't rule out support for faltering companies. 
""This matter is being carefully studied by officials at the ministry in full coordination with the private sector,"" an official at the Trade and Industry Ministry, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.
TWO SCENARIOS
While military-owned companies have been around for decades in Egypt they have flourished since former armed forces chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi led the military in ousting Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in 2014 and took over a year later.

The military's plant, billed as the biggest cement factory to have been built anywhere in the world at a single time, opened a year after the market began shrinking. 
The plant appears to have been inspired by a government study in the early 2000s that predicted demand would rise to 100 million tonnes a year, the company officials said.
But cement sales in Egypt fell to 43.8 million tonnes in 2019 from 49.5 million in 2017, according to central bank data, a period that coincided with austerity measures under a three-year IMF reform plan. 
The austerity measures, which included higher energy prices and the implementation of a 14% value-added tax, fell particularly hard on smaller builders as people in lower income brackets postponed residential construction.
Between 70% and 80% of all cement made in Egypt is sold in bags to small builders, while the rest goes to property developments and government mega-projects. 
An expansion of big projects over the last three years, including the construction of Egypt's new administrative capital 45 km outside Cairo and tunnels under the Suez Canal, has not absorbed the slack, one cement official said.
Some cement companies are now trying to salvage what they can.
State-owned National Cement Co was liquidated in late 2018 while Tourah Cement (CA:TORA), which is part of HeidelbergCement, auctioned off the equipment at an idle cement plant in December 2019 to boost its cash flow.
Suez Cement, also part of HeidelbergCement, announced last month that because of oversupply and a sustained decrease in demand combined with the COVID-19 crisis it was reducing management salaries by 20% to 30%. 
""There are two scenarios,"" said one of the cement company officials. ""One is that they wait until some companies close. Two is that the government steps in to support companies.""

With the so-called “dot plot” acting as forward guidance, and expected to show no rate hikes through the end of 2022, there is a buying opportunity in medium-term bonds, according to JPMorgan strategists including Matthew Jozoff. The central bank will be on hold “for a long time,” making five-year notes attractive, said TD’s Priya Misra and Gennadiy Goldberg.
“We see the Fed reinforcing its guidance somewhat,” the JPMorgan team wrote Friday. “Given current valuations, we think there is room for intermediate yields to stabilize, and we recommend adding duration in five-year Treasuries.”
Five-year yields were little changed Monday at 0.46%, having risen 16 basis points last week as the U.S. economy continued to re-open and employment data smashed expectations. JPMorgan has a year-end forecast of 0.40% on the securities, while TD’s target for its “strategic” trade recommendation is 0.30%.
Fed Commitment
Fed officials will publish new forecasts this week, and Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to re-affirm the central bank will use its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during the pandemic. Previous meetings where the Fed made adjustments to guidance were genuinely supportive of lower yields, JPMorgan said.
Meanwhile, expectations for the Fed to undertake yield-curve control by the end of the year, and the risk of a second wave of coronavirus infections should also help support Treasuries, according to TD. The strategists suggest investors double down on five-year notes if yields continue to rise.
“We initiate half our risk here and look to add to the position if we get closer to 0.60%,” the TD strategists wrote Friday. “The biggest risk is a much stronger economic rebound and a move higher in longer-term rates.”

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 12:10AM ET</span>",Japan details some spending in controversial $92 billion budget reserves,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan has set aside $92 billion in emergency budget reserves to prepare for a ""protracted war"" against the novel coronavirus, Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Monday, detailing some spending from the massive pool of money seen by some as opaque.
Aso made the remarks as the government presented parliament with the second extra budget for approval to fund a $1.1 trillion stimulus package to combat the pandemic, which featured the 10-trillion-yen ($92 billion) reserves set aside for contingencies.
""While setting eyes on a protracted war, we must take all possible measures and top up emergency reserves in order to flexibly respond to changes in the situation,"" Aso said.
""At least 5 trillion yen is needed in case the second and third wave of infections turn the situation very severe ... Another 5 trillion yen must be secured so that we can swiftly respond to any situation,"" Aso said in a speech in parliament.
Half the 10-trillion-yen reserves would be spent to help firms keep employment and pay rents, and to boost medical care, he added.
It was unprecedented for the government to detail spending from emergency budget reserves.
The rare move followed criticism from the opposition that the government could tap the massive pool of money at their own discretion without parliament checking, which would undermine fiscal discipline and public finances.
Unlike other budget items which require prior scrutiny by lawmakers, the law stipulates emergency reserves can be spent without prescreening, allowing the government to meet spending needs flexibly in the event of disasters and contingencies.
In Japan, the cabinet decides how the reserves will be spent, and needs to report to parliament only after spending.
The 10-trillion-yen emergency reserves account for roughly one-third of direct spending worth 33 trillion yen that funds the stimulus. It stood about 20 times an average amount annually earmarked in the past two decades, finance ministry data shows.
The government used to set aside 350 billion yen for emergency reserves in an initial budget. It then topped up the amount as needed when disasters struck such as the 2009 global financial crisis and the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.
Emergency reserves have totalled 12 trillion yen for the current fiscal year, when taken together with what was earmarked in the initial budget and the first stimulus adopted in April. 
Decades of heavy spending to stimulate a stagnant economy has left Japan with the industrial world's heaviest public debt burden at more than twice the size of its economy.

The WTO post will become vacant at the end of August after incumbent Roberto Azevedo, from Brazil, said he would step down a year early. 
The next director-general will be faced with U.S.-China tensions and rising protectionism exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Seade is currently Mexico's deputy foreign minister for North America and has experience working in China as well as with the United States. Two sources with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters he will be Mexico's candidate to replace Azevedo. 
The news was first reported by Mexico's El Universal newspaper. The president's office and foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Seade was a deputy director general of the WTO when it was created in the early 1990s. When President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador won office in 2018, Seade was brought in to lead negotiations for a new North American trade deal to replace NAFTA. 
Previously, Seade worked at universities in Hong Kong for more than a decade. 
WTO members can nominate their own nationals as candidates from June 8 to July 8. Several names have been cited as possible candidates from Africa and Europe, with some in Europe taking the view that leadership of the trade body should alternate between the developing and developed world.

Deputies in the National Assembly, which nearly always ratifies government proposals, voted by over 94% in favour of the European Union Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA).
The EVFTA, expected to take effect in July, is the European Union's second deal with a member of the Association of Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN) after Singapore, and one of few with a developing country.
Vietnam will have a transition period of up to 10 years for some imports, such as cars.
It will open up Vietnam's services, including post, banking and shipping and public procurement markets, align some standards and protect EU food and drinks, such as French champagne or Greek feta cheese, from imitations in Vietnam.
Critics in Europe have taken issue with Vietnam's record on human and labour rights, although the deal does include commitments in those areas.
The World Bank said in May the EVFTA could boost Vietnam's gross domestic product and exports by 2.4% and 12% respectively by 2030 and lift hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty.
""Such benefits are particularly urgent to lock in positive economic gains as they country responds to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the World Bank said.

The prime minister is said to be pressing for legislation to make it mandatory for companies to report attempted takeovers which could give rise to security risks, backed by the threat of criminal sanctions, according to the newspaper.
Companies that fail to report takeovers or ignore conditions imposed by the UK government after takeovers could see their directors jailed, disqualified or fined, the newspaper said.
The approach, which is being pushed by the prime minister's adviser Dominic Cummings, is said to have the support of finance minister Rishi Sunak and will require businesses to declare when a foreign company tries to buy more than 25% of shares, purchase assets or intellectual property, the Times said.
The prime minister also wants academic partnerships and research projects to be included under the rules, the newspaper added.
The legislation, which The Times said could be tabled within weeks, comes at a time of increased tension between Britain and China, after the country designated Huawei a ""high-risk vendor"" in January and expressed concern over Beijing's handling of the situation in Hong Kong.
Johnson has also come under pressure from the United States and lawmakers from his own party, who have argued that Huawei's equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, which the Chinese telecom giant has repeatedly denied.

Khartoum is in desperate need of financial help to reorganise its economy. Inflation has been running at nearly 100% and the currency tumbling as the government prints money to subsidise bread, fuel and electricity.
The talks mark a thaw in Sudan's relationship with the IMF. Until now it has been unable to tap the IMF or the World Bank for support because it is still listed by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism and has $1.3 billion of IMF arrears.
The U.S. indicated after President Omar al-Bashir was removed from power in April 2019 that it was willing to work to remove Sudan from the terrorism list.
""This week Sudan began negotiations ... to agree on a Staff-Monitored Programme that seeks to open doors for international financing & investment in major development, infrastructure, peacebuilding & job creation projects for youth,"" Elbadawi said on Twitter on Sunday.
Sudanese officials recently said they expect Khartoum will be removed from the terror list soon.
Sudan has debts of around $62 billion, including arrears of around $3 billion to international financial institutions, Elbadawi said in October.
IMF communications director Gerry Rice said on Thursday that Sudan had requested talks, which he expected to be completed by around the fourth week of June.
The programme would be ""a way for Sudan to show a track record of good policy implementation,"" Rice said. ""By showing such a track record, it can help Sudan toward clearing its arrears to the IMF, which in turn, and this is the key, can unlock financing from other sources as well.""

1466,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 07, 2020 10:09AM ET</span>",Fed To Stay Full Throttle With Credit Support Despite Debt Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve may have stoked one of the strongest corporate debt market rallies in decades, but it’s too soon to declare an all-clear for credit with the economy facing a potentially rocky road ahead.
Sure, U.S. investment-grade borrowing costs have retreated to near all-time lows, and companies have sold $1 trillion of bonds at the fastest pace on record -- evidence that merely announcing a plan to pump liquidity into corporate debt markets has helped ease strains before barely a dollar of central bank money was deployed.
But the Fed’s emergency pandemic lending programs are just getting started. Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to repeat that the Fed will deploy its full suite of liquidity backstops when he addresses reporters Wednesday after a two-day policy meeting -- even if there is little need for some at the moment.
There are also worries that the economy could drag as double-digit unemployment punches holes in consumer demand and corporate revenue growth. Even though the labor market performed better than expected in May, unemployment at 13.3% is well above the peak of the last recession.
Central bankers are likely to remain undeterred in both their credit and monetary policy support until the jobless rate gets closer to their full employment estimate of 4.1%. Fed officials will publish new forecasts this week.
Not Time
“What the Fed has done is prevented an economic crisis from becoming a financial crisis,” said Julia Coronado, founding partner of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC and a former Fed economist. “They won’t say it is time to start pulling back. They won’t take it for granted when they see the playbook worked.”
The Fed still has to roll out key components of its corporate credit programs, and officials could stoke the rally further if they announce a decision to ramp up Treasury purchases.
Current Fed government bond buying is to ensure market functioning. But officials could shift purchases toward deliberately stimulating demand in the economy, compressing returns on risk-free Treasuries and sending investors scurrying into higher-yielding debt.
‘Belt and Suspenders’
“The programs are doing a lot of work on the credit spreads, but the total cost of finance includes the spread on the risk-free rate,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. He said the Fed will adopt a “belt and suspenders” approach to continued credit easing policies and announce a program of $80 billion per month in longer-term Treasury purchases sometime over its next two meetings.
The Fed announced two corporate credit facilities March 23 of up to $750 billion, taking a radical step into direct finance of large companies. Since then, investment-grade and high-yield companies have gone on a record-breaking borrowing spree, taking advantage of robust investor demand that the Fed also encouraged.
The Primary Market Corporate Credit facility will buy bonds directly from companies, as well as slices of syndicated loans. That program is expected to launch in the next couple of weeks, according to people familiar with the matter.
ETF Buying
The Secondary Market facility buys exchange-traded funds of investment grade and high-risk, high-yield junk bonds, in addition to bonds already trading in the market. Only the ETF purchases are underway with $4.3 billion in the Fed’s portfolio as of June 2.
“Before they bought a single bond or ETF, the liquidity crisis was over,” said Hans Mikkelsen, head of high-grade credit strategy at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). “The Fed doesn’t need to do more. It’s a done deal.”
One reason other components of the programs have been slower to get off the ground is they are complicated. For example, a company must be able to show that it has significant operations and a majority of its employees based in the U.S. for its bonds to be eligible. To obtain a direct loan, the company must also certify that it couldn’t get “adequate credit” in private markets at a normal rate.
Such requirements could mean modest take-up once the programs are fully operational. Fed officials probably won’t worry: they created the programs as a back-stop, not to replace private sector sources of credit.
Mission Accomplished?
Looking at Fed guidelines for its manager, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., it’s tempting to think the central bank’s work is done. The guidelines note three goals: support for corporate debt markets to facilitate “orderly” pricing of risk; support for primary issuance at costs that reflect normal conditions; and to reduce fire sales.
A spokesman for BlackRock declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for the New York Fed.
Risk premiums on both high-yield and investment-grade debt have essentially been cut in half since the Fed announced the programs. And chalk one up for the next goal, too, when looking at companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). setting record low borrowing costs in its recent bond deal. Granted, others like Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd. are still paying up handsomely to access new funds, a reflection of its fundamental operating stress versus distorted liquidity.
The fire sales may be harder to satisfy. While market liquidity has improved dramatically since mid-March when the pandemic first swept across the U.S., more companies than ever are in distress, and bankruptcy filings are on pace to rival numbers last seen in the Great Recession.
The Fed has made it clear its job is not to bail out bankrupt companies. By sticking to its mission of providing a liquidity backstop for corporate debt, investors question if there’s much work left to be done.
“By coming out so big on corporate credit, investors took over and fixed it for them,” said Elaine Stokes, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles & Co. “They’ve done enough, but there’s no harm for them to say we’re here if you need us.”

1468,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 07, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>",Economic Calendar - Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,"By Noreen Burke
Investing.com - The main focus this week will be on Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting, with investors on the lookout for clues on how much more, if any, stimulus may be needed. The U.S. calendar also features data on CPI, jobless claims and consumer sentiment. Investors will continue to monitor the steepening yield curve amid a selloff in U.S. bonds. In the euro zone, European Central Bank head Christine Lagarde will likely offer more insights into last week’s larger than expected increase in its stimulus program. Concerns over Chinese growth could also be on the radar after weak trade data on Sunday. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
The U.S. central bank's monetary policy announcement on Wednesday will be the first since April when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy could feel the weight of the economic shutdown for more than a year.
Investors will be keen to hear the Fed's views on the economic outlook in the wake of Friday’s U.S. employment report which showed that the economy unexpectedly added jobs in May after suffering record losses in the prior month.
The report offered the clearest signal yet that the worst of the downturn triggered by the coronavirus crisis is probably over, fueling a rally in stocks and a selloff in Treasuries.
Friday’s U.S. jobs report added fuel to a dramatic sell-off in U.S. government bonds from their recent record highs, pushing the yield curve to its steepest level since March.
The steepening -- when longer-dated yields rise faster than short-dated ones -- signals a brighter growth outlook. But too fast a rise in borrowing costs can strangle the economic recovery.
While the Fed could introduce yield-curve control measures to target short-term rates, fund managers say they expect yields will need to rise significantly to justify any intervention in the bulk of the curve. Instead, they are watching for hints that the central bank believes the economic rebound can support the rise in yields.
This week’s calendar also features updates on U.S. jobless claims, a key indicator of the health of the economy, along with consumer price inflation and consumer sentiment.
Claims have declined since hitting a record 6.8 million in late March, falling below 2 million last week for the first time since mid-March. The report suggested the worst is over for the labor market, combined with Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report.
Meanwhile, CPI should continue to ease given the lack of demand in the economy, while the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index should continue to rise amid the re-openings and rally in stock markets.
On Monday, ECB President Christine Lagarde will testify, via satellite link, before the European Parliament Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. Lawmakers will have the opportunity to ask questions about the reasons behind the ECB’s larger-than-expected increase in its emergency bond buying stimulus program.
On the data front, Germany is to release industrial production data for April on Monday followed by France and the wider euro zone later in the week. Germany, the euro area’s largest economy, is facing the prospect of its deepest recession since World War Two as the coronavirus pandemic takes its toll, even though lockdown restrictions are now being eased.
Chinese trade data on Sunday indicated that global demand for goods produced by the world’s second-largest economy remains weak.
Chinese exports contracted in May as global coronavirus lockdowns continued to devastate demand, while a sharper-than-expected fall in imports pointed to mounting pressure on manufacturers as global growth stalls.
The data could reinforce expectations that China may not have any growth this year. Investors will be watching to see how bullish stock markets will react as the unstoppable force of Chinese production runs into an impregnable global downturn.

1469,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>","'Never say never' on ECB buying shares, Holzmann tells newspaper","VIENNA (Reuters) - ""Never say never"" on the European Central Bank one day buying shares rather than government or corporate bonds, but it has not discussed the idea yet, ECB Governing Council member Robert Holzmann said in comments published on Sunday.
The ECB on Thursday announced a bigger-than-expected expansion of its stimulus package to prop up an economy plunged by the coronavirus pandemic into its worst recession since World War Two. 
Holzmann took over as head of the Austrian National Bank just last year but has already been outspoken on various issues, calling for the ECB to lower its often-undershot inflation target and warning against negative rates. He also says he initially suggested that Thursday's decision be put off.
""Never say never. If the need is there, this discussion will definitely have to take place. But currently that discussion does not exist,"" Holzmann told newspaper Die Presse when asked if the ECB could start buying shares.
On lowering the inflation target from just under 2%, Holzmann said he could still change his stance in a discussion that the ECB has pushed back because of the pandemic.
""If it is difficult to get from 1.5% to 1.9%, then in a time of low inflation expectations one can also set oneself a different target, although I myself have not yet formed a final opinion here,"" Holzmann said.
""The fundamental discussion on ECB strategy has been postponed because of the crisis and should be taken up again as of the summer,"" he added.
ECB President Christine Lagarde has made a greater focus on climate change a priority, but Holzmann urged caution.

""There are thoughts about becoming greener. One must, however, be very careful because with these instruments the market is often still very small and illiquid,"" he said, apparently referring to green bonds.

1470,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2020 03:20PM ET</span>",German lawmakers see way out of ECB court ruling conundrum: paper,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A cross-party group of German lawmakers want to work with the European Parliament to resolve a challenge from Germany's top court to the European Central Bank's flagship policy programme, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported. 
The German Constitutional Court last month gave the ECB three months to explain the proportionality of its bond purchases or risk losing Germany's Bundesbank -- one of 19 national central banks that are members of the ECB -- as a participant. It also called on the German parliament and government to challenge the ECB on the matter.
The ruling poses a conundrum for Berlin, which is bound to respect the Karlsruhe court but at the same time does not want to erode the independence of the ECB, whose unprecedented economic stimulus programme has kept the euro zone intact.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung said in an advance release from Sunday's edition that an idea floated by Sven Simon, a member of the European Parliament with Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), was emerging as a potential solution.
Simon has suggested that the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament in Berlin, should demand a statement of clarification from the European Parliament, rather than the ECB. 
Unlike national parliaments, the European Parliament has the right to put questions to the ECB, and the ECB president gives testimony to the European legislature in regular hearings.
Simon has therefore written to the ECB asking it to make its internal deliberations on the effects of its policy action public. If it did so, it would, in Simon's view, make it clear that it had in fact carried out the audit that Karlsruhe requires, the newspaper reported. The bank is obliged to reply.

The CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) support the proposal, along with their Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners, and the opposition Greens and liberal Free Democrats (FDP), the paper added.

1471,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>",Kosovo removes trade barriers on Serbia to allow talks,"By Fatos Bytyci
PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo's newly elected government has removed all trade barriers for goods produced in Serbia, paving the way for a resumption of talks with Belgrade on an agreement that could enable the tiny Balkan country to get United Nations membership.
After just three days in office, Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti said his country had acted in accordance with demands from the United States and the European Union.
""We are ready to immediately sit at the dialogue table,"" Hoti said after a government meeting. ""Now we expect the same thing from the Serb side.""
Hoti said he expected Serbia to stop its campaign against Kosovar independence, which is focused on convincing various countries to withdraw recognition of Kosovo and block its membership of international organisations.
European Union-sponsored talks between Belgrade and Pristina came to a halt in November 2018 when Kosovo introduced a 100% tax on goods produced in Serbia.
The government of Hoti's predecessor, Albin Kurti, removed the tax, but introduced other restrictions on trade, a move that angered the EU and United States - the most vocal international backers of Kosovar independence.
Reacting to the government's decision, Kurti said the move was in ""Serbia's service.""
The United States, Kosovo’s biggest supporter both politically and financially, said it would unfreeze around $50 million in economic aid that had been blocked due to Pristina’s refusal to lift the tariffs.
The aid will come via the Millennium Challenge Corporation or MCC, a U.S. government foreign assistance agency.
Kosovo, where Albanians account for 90% of the population, declared independence from Serbia in 2008, nearly a decade after NATO bombed Serbia to halt the killing and expulsion of Albanians in Kosovo during a two-year counter-insurgency. 
Serbia, together with its traditional ally Russia, has been blocking Kosovo's membership of international organisations, including the United Nations.
A deal on mutual recognition between Kosovo and Serbia is also a pre-condition for Belgrade to join the EU.
Kosovo’s independence is recognised by more than 110 countries, but not by several nations including Russia, China and Serbia, which still considers it part of its territory.

""Whatever agreement we reach it is not going to be favourable for us (Serbia) but we are going to try and find the least unfavourable solution,"" Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic told Belgrade Prva TV on Saturday.

""I have seen a spike in anxiety for my black kid clients because they are having access to the news,"" said Javonte' Bass, a clinical mental health counselor. ""When the parents are watching, they're listening.""
Fear of catching the coronavirus forced families indoors. Fear of dying at the hands of police is keeping kids from going back out, Bass said. One 9-year-old black child even asked Bass, ""Am I going to get shot, too?""
Jones said the CNN event was not meant to be a historical rundown of slavery and colonialism in the United States. It urged parents to teach their children empathy. ""Failing to teach kids about empathy and fairness is always harmful,"" he said.
That applies to views of law enforcement as well, Jones and Bass emphasized. ""Police officers are not saints or superheroes. They're human beings,"" Jones said. ""Some are good. Most are good, but some are bad.""
Education is a theme among the responses from brands for children.
""Our mission is to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow and that includes inspiring them to be tolerant, inclusive, and kind,"" toy company the Lego Group said in a statement. 
In addition to pausing advertising for a week to avoid marketing any of its toys, including police-themed toys, next to images of police violence, the company is committing $4 million to organizations that teach children about racial inequality.
Lego has also encouraged fans to come up with new ideas for inclusive toy sets on its platform Lego Ideas.
One of its previous sets, the Women of NASA, featured astronaut Mae Jemison, the first African-American woman in space. It was inspired by a submission to Lego Ideas. 

MGA Entertainment Inc, which owns toy brands such as L.O.L. Dolls and Little Tikes, announced it is releasing a limited edition Black Lives Matter Bratz Dolls. The company will donate $10 from each doll sold to anti-racism programs and organizations.

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2020 09:40AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Malaysia to double deficit to fund stimulus, says finance minister","By Krishna N. Das and Liz Lee
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia aims to borrow its way out of an economic slump brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, and the finance minister told Reuters it will nearly double its fiscal deficit this year while keeping open the option of raising the public debt ceiling.
Southeast Asia's third-biggest economy has announced incentives worth 295 billion ringgit ($69 billion) to soften the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, with the government vowing to directly inject 45 billion ringgit of that into the economy, mostly raised through domestic borrowings.
Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told Reuters the fiscal deficit would rise to around 6% of annual economic output this year because of the stimulus, and that a direct fiscal injection of 10 billion ringgit announced on Friday would be raised through domestic borrowing.
""There is only so much monetary policy can do,"" Tengku Zafrul said in an interview in his office. ""So you need fiscal policy to come into play, as long as you have the discipline and the commitment in the longer term to go back to where you should be in terms of the deficit.""
Tengku Zafrul, who was chief executive of lender CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (KL:CIMB) before joining the three-month-old government, said the goal was to narrow the fiscal deficit back down to less than 4% of gross domestic product (GDP) over the next three years or so. It was 3.2% last year.
""How bad was it during the (global financial crisis)? It was 6.7%. So we have room if we want to borrow,"" he said, referring to the country's peak annual deficit in 2009.
The region's largest economy, Indonesia, said last month that it expected its budget deficit to swell to 6.27% due to virus-related stimulus.
Tengku Zafrul said Malaysia's outstanding public debt now stands at 52% of GDP but that ""if we need to, then we should increase the ceiling"" beyond the current 55% ""to help the people and the economy"".
He declined to say how high the government might seek to raise the ceiling, a move that would require approval from parliament.
Neighbouring Thailand said in April its latest borrowing plans would increase its public debt to 51.84% of GDP in the current fiscal year and 57.96% in the next one.
Tengku Zafrul, 46, said there was no immediate need for the central bank to cut its benchmark interest rate further from its decade low of 2%, ""given the liquidity in the country and given where the currency is going and where we are we as an economy"".
Bank Negara Malaysia's monetary policy committee next meets on July 7, and some analysts have predicted another cut.

HAVANA (Reuters) - The Trump administration has ordered Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) to wind down hotel operations in Communist-run Cuba, a company spokeswoman told Reuters, extinguishing what had been a symbol of the U.S.-Cuban detente.
Starwood Hotels, now owned by Marriott, four years ago became the first U.S. hotel company to sign a deal with Cuba since the 1959 revolution amid the normalization of relations pursued by former President Barack Obama.
But the administration of President Donald Trump has unraveled that detente, tightening the decades-old U.S. trade embargo on Cuba and saying it wants to pressure the island into democratic reform and to stop supporting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
The approach could help Trump bolster support in the large Cuban-American community in Florida, a state considered vital to his re-election chances in November.
A company spokeswoman said the U.S. Treasury Department had ordered the company to wind down its operation of the Four Points Sheraton in Havana by Aug. 31. It would also not be allowed to open other hotels it had been preparing to run.
A U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson said it could not comment on specific licensing matters, but that the administration aimed to prevent Cuba's military from using revenue from tourism to ""oppress its own people"", 
The Four Points Sheraton in Havana, like swaths of the tourism sector and economy at large, is controlled by the commercial arm of the Cuban military. 
""In 2017, Trump promised he would not disrupt existing contracts U.S. businesses had with Cuba,"" wrote William LeoGrande, a Cuba expert at American University in Washington, on Twitter. ""Promise made, promise broken.""
The news comes two days after the U.S. State Department expanded its list of Cuban entities with which Americans are banned from doing business to include the military-owned financial corporation that handles U.S. remittances to Cuba.
U.S. sanctions have further crippled an economy already struggling with a decline in aid from leftist ally Venezuela and the end of hard-currency generating Cuban medical missions in Brazil and elsewhere.
Philip Peters who runs the FocusCuba business consultancy and has advised Marriott, said no good had come from a lifetime of U.S. sanctions that separated the U.S. and Cuban peoples, harmed Cuba’s economy, and limited American influence in Cuba.

""Marriott .. will hopefully return to do business in Cuba, along with others, to encourage American travel and to help Cuba prosper and integrate into the global economy,"" he said.

1476,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 08:05PM ET</span>",Explainer: May's jobs report stunner: real deal or head fake?,"By Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Dunsmuir
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy unexpectedly added jobs in May, surprising economists and analysts who had forecast millions more losing their livelihoods, and raising hopes of a faster economic recovery than expected.
More than 2.5 million people were newly employed last month, the Labor Department reported on Friday, but that follows a record drop of more than 20 million in April. The unemployment rate fell to roughly 13% compared to almost 15% in the prior month.
Much of the rise in jobs was centered on hardest-hit industries in food services and drinking places, which added 1.4 million jobs and accounted for about half of the employment gains. The leisure and hospitality sector overall added 1.2 million jobs.
But what explains the unexpected jump and should the numbers be taken at face value?
STATES REOPENING
It makes sense that more people would become employed as stay-at-home restrictions eased. More than 95% of Americans were under some form of lockdown order in the month of April. By May 19, all 50 states had begun some partial re-opening of their economies. Healthcare employment increased by 312,000 in May as dentists, doctors and other healthcare providers were able to see patients again. The construction industry also benefited with 464,000 jobs added in May, gaining back almost half of April's drop, while retail added nearly 368,000 jobs. 
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM (PPP)
Some of the jobs gains reported for May could be a reflection of the Paycheck Protection Program, the U.S. government's forgivable loan scheme that provides funding to small businesses that keep workers on payroll, which was launched at the beginning of April. 
It works essentially as an unemployment benefit program funded through businesses rather than the government in order to keep workers attached to their employers during the coronavirus-related disruption.
Roughly 4.5 million businesses have received a total of about $510 billion in paycheck protection loans, data from the Small Business Administration shows. Some 2.9 million of them did not receive their funds until after April 27, according to the data.
Howard Flax is a case in point. He shut his art supply stores in San Francisco and Oakland in mid-March, laying off his 16 employees. He applied to the PPP program in early April but didn't receive a $137,500 loan until mid May. Flax immediately hired back 14 workers, even though revenues are still well short of pre-crisis levels and his business restricted to curbside pickup. 
Under current rules, the payroll subsidy will run out in early July. ""If we are not able to recoup some of these losses during this period, it's all for naught,"" he said.
Vaughan-Bassett Furniture Co., in Galax, Virginia, largely shut down and furloughed 90% of its roughly 500 production workers on March 29. A month later, it brought them back.
Chief Executive Wyatt Bassett said, ""We would not have been able to bring them back without it (the PPP loan), because the demand wasn't there.""
The demand drop flagged by employers like Flax and Bassett raises the prospect that unemployment numbers, especially in the hard-hit leisure and hospitality sectors that showed the largest jump in jobs in May, could rise again in a couple of months' time if no extension to the existing program is put in place.
DATA ERRORS
The Labor Department has been upfront about the limitations in its data gathering for the monthly employment report due to the coronavirus epidemic. For the second month in a row, it said the true unemployment rate would be higher than currently estimated - in May, three percentage points higher - as many unemployed people are probably being misclassified as being employed. There are also those who had been employed but left the labor force when the virus hit but would otherwise have been counted as unemployed if they were actively seeking work.
Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York, was among those putting some of the gains down to wonky math. ""Are the furloughed unemployed or not? It seems too strange to me ... it's bizarre. At face value, April was the low and companies hired massively in May. It's perplexing.""

Other data including the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) private payrolls report and the Institute for Supply Management survey readings on manufacturing and service sector employment all showed employment contracting last month.

The poll came out a day after Latin America's No. 3 economy reported that industrial output crashed 33.5% in April from the same month last year.
The central bank poll of 40 analysts projected that inflation will be 43.3% this year. The grim economic picture comes as Argentina tries to restructure about $65 billion in debt after defaulting on its sovereign bonds last month.
Striking a deal is key for the country to avoid years of legal battles and being locked out of global capital markets, which happened after a major default in 2001.
Argentina's construction sector plummeted 75.6% in April from April 2019, government data showed on Thursday.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's official budget deficit target for this year of 10% of gross domestic product is already looking optimistic, Treasury Secretary Mansueto Almeida said on Friday, a sign of the huge pressure on public finances from the coronavirus crisis.
The government revised its primary deficit forecast, which excludes interest payments, to 10% of GDP only two weeks ago. But Almeida said that tax revenues could be lower than expected and warned against extending emergency spending programs.
""We are going for a primary deficit of 10% of GDP this year. Could it be worse? It could be worse,"" Almeida said in an online debate hosted by Verde Asset Management.
This target is based on postponed tax payments because of the crisis being made in the second half of the year and emergency spending measures not being extended, Almeida said.
Almeida insisted that emergency payments to informal, low-paid workers of 600 reais ($121) a month for three months, which will total around 150 billion reais, cannot be extended.
Making the program permanent would increase the government's primary expenditure by a further 8% of GDP and the tax load would have to rise by 10% of GDP.
""That makes no sense at all,"" he said, noting that even extending it to the end of the year would increase Brazil's debt to more than 100% of GDP.
While the government this year will stick to its spending cap rule, regarded by policymakers as the country's fiscal pillar, Almeida admitted that the situation becomes more difficult in 2021 if revenues and economic growth undershoot expectations.

""This worries us. It's something we'll have to deal with and try to reverse,"" he said, adding that it may be six years before federal revenues return to pre-crisis levels.

The regional government said in a statement on Friday that it had opened an invitation to holders of around $590 million of the 2024 notes, which could see new debt instruments issued. The missed payment is still within a grace period.
The debt revamp is only a small sideshow as the South American country's national government races to seal a deal to restructure around $65 billion in sovereign debt, but underscores how the provinces are also grappling with their own debt crises.
The larger province of Buenos Aires is also looking to restructure around $7 billion in foreign debt.
Argentina has been pummeled by stubborn inflation, sky-high interest rates and a biting recession, which is now being sharpened by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Mendoza's invitation will expire on June 16. The provincial government said it had engaged  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities and AdCap Securities to help manage the invitation process.

Sunak will still announce some limited measures next month, but this would not be a ""Budget or mini-Budget"", an ally of Sunak told the FT.
""We will be taking stock of the economic situation, and looking at if and where further support makes sense ahead of the more significant moments in the autumn,"" the finance ministry said in response to the FT report.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson on May 27 promised that a post-coronavirus recovery package would be put before parliament. Sunak has also talked about the need to focus resources on national recovery.
The Daily Mail newspaper reported that Johnson is drawing up an economic recovery bill with the goal of reducing red tape and reviving the economy from the effects of the virus outbreak.
Ministers have been asked to submit suggestions and Johnson's plans may include reforms to revive infrastructure development that has been halted by the COVID-19 lockdown, the Daily Mail reported, without giving financial details.
Neither the prime minister nor the finance minister have formally set out a timeline, and Sunak has declined to say whether he would bring forward his next budget statement, due in the autumn, to spell out how he will tackle Britain's surging debt.

Britain's emergency public spending surge and tax cuts to soften the coronavirus hit to the economy will cost around 133 billion pounds ($169 billion) in the current financial year, the fiscal watchdog has said, helping to lift the budget deficit to wartime levels.

The agreement, which must be finalized by the Fund's executive board, would safeguard economic gains achieved by Egypt over the past three years and put the country on strong footing for a sustained recovery, the IMF said.
The Fund said the agreement followed virtual meetings with Egyptian authorities from May 19 to June 5.
The agreement comes after the Egyptian pound, which had held steady against the dollar for two months, slipped 2.2% against the dollar this week, its biggest weekly decline since March 2017.
Economists, who said Egypt began negotiating the standby loan before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and after completing a $12 billion, three-year program with the IMF last year, had anticipated that the Fund would be looking for at least a moderate currency devaluation.
The standby arrangement (SBA) comes on top of $2.77 billion in emergency IMF financing for Egypt, where the pandemic has brought tourism to a standstill, triggered major capital flight, and curtailed remittances from Egyptian workers based abroad.
""The SBA ... supports the authorities' efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability amid the COVID-19 shock while continuing to advance key structural reforms,"" IMF official Uma Ramakrishnan, who led the talks with Egypt, said in a statement.
She said the funding would put Egypt on ""a strong footing for sustained recovery as well as higher and more inclusive growth and job creation over the medium term.""
The standby funding would also support health and social spending, improve fiscal transparency and spur private-sector-led growth and job creation, while paving the way for additional bilateral and multilateral financial support, she said.

Powell and Mnuchin conducted 21 phone calls during the month, which now appears to have been the worst period for the economy, the readout of Powell's calendar indicated. 
That was nearly twice the number of meetings or calls with Mnuchin as Powell had in March, when the outbreak first threw the economy into a tailspin and forced the Fed to cut interest rates to near zero and, in concert with the Treasury, roll out nearly a dozen emergency support programs.
In addition, Powell held 14 calls with key U.S. lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in their first discussion since December.
He also met twice with Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), the world's largest asset management company, which the Fed hired to advise on some of its emergency facilities.
For the second month in a row, Powell also met with a health expert. On April 13, he had a 90-minute COVID-19 briefing from unidentified officials with Johns Hopkins University, which has emerged as one of the main U.S. resources for tracking the course of the pandemic.

Powell has repeatedly said any economic recovery will hinge on success in battling a disease that has sickened nearly 1.9 million Americans and killed more than 108,000. Not long after that meeting, optimism among Powell and other Fed officials for a fast recovery faded, although it is not clear that the ""Johns Hopkins COVID briefing"" fed into that change of tone.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump announced on Friday he will open up a 5,000 square mile conservation area in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of New England to commercial fishing.
The move allows commercial fishing to resume in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, a sanctuary created in 2016 during the Obama administration. It also cancels a planned phase out of red crab and lobster fisheries in the area.
Trump signed a proclamation on opening the area during a visit to Maine in his latest move to appeal to working class and blue collar workers in an election year by touting regulatory rollbacks that he says can restore jobs and economic activity. 
""We’re cutting regulations from highways and roadways to fish,"" Trump said at a roundtable event in Bangor.
Trump, who won in Maine's rural 2nd Congressional district in the 2016 election, also announced he would create a task force to identify international markets for U.S. seafood.
Environmental groups and some recreational fishermen warned that allowing commercial fishing in these areas undermines the protections established by the monument designations, putting marine wildlife, including endangered whales and sea turtles, sharks and fragile corals in danger of harm and entanglement in fishing nets.
""These are fragile and vulnerable resources, and I am concerned for their future health,"" said Rip Cunningham, former chair of the New England Fishery Management Council. 
The commercial seafood industry and regional fishery management councils have pressed the Trump administration to restore commercial fishing in federal waters closed off under monument protections, citing the regulatory burden that they say forces fishermen to travel further with increased operational expenses and safety risks.
Kristan Porter, president of the Maine Lobsterman's Association who attended the roundtable, said the monument's restrictions on commercial fishing were done without the industry's input. ""Fishermen needed to have input into this and we didn't,"" he said.
In 2017, then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke had recommended that Trump allow commercial fishing in the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts monument. His recommendations came during a sweeping review of national monuments across the country that had been created by previous presidents under the Antiquities Act.

So far Trump has only proceeded to reduce the size of Utah's Bears Ears and Grand Staircase monuments, while leaving the other monuments intact. The Bears Ears and Grand Staircase decisions are now being challenged in court.

Total employment increased by just 1.1% for women in Canada in May, compared with 2.4% for men, the Statistics Canada agency said. Men were also more likely to have recovered jobs lost in March and April due to temporary COVID-19 shutdowns. 
Canada unexpectedly gained 289,600 jobs in May, with the jobless rate hitting a record 13.7%. [L1N2DI0NB] 
The service-sector, which generally requires face-to-face interaction, is traditionally more female dominated. 
""I think it would be fair, as some economists say, to describe the recession we are currently experiencing as a 'she-cession,'"" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters on Friday.
Freeland said Ottawa is working with the provinces on safely reopening childcare ""because for women, for mothers, without childcare it's impossible for them to go back to work."" 
Among parents with at least one child under the age of 6, men were roughly three times more likely to have returned to work than women, Statistics Canada data showed. Women with children under 18 were also more likely to be working less than half of their usual hours.
Canada's 13 provinces and territories have been gradually reopening their economies in recent weeks, and the Canadian economy is starting to show green shoots after the coronavirus pandemic forced provinces to shut down businesses and caused a record plunge in economic activity.

""Just as women took the brunt of the downturn, they're likely to see the upturn in labor markets arrive more slowly than men, and you see that already,"" said Brett House, deputy chief economist at Scotiabank.

(Reuters) - Investors stopped pricing for the possibility that the Federal Reserve will adopt negative rates, after a surprisingly strong employment report on Friday boosted expectations that the worst of the economic downturn is in the past.
The U.S. economy unexpectedly added jobs in May after suffering record losses in the prior month, offering the clearest signal yet that the downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic was probably over, though the road to recovery could be long.
The Federal Reserve in March slashed the target range for the federal funds rate that it controls to between zero and 0.25% as part of an emergency response to the coronavirus crisis.
Last month, fed funds futures <0#FF:> began pricing for the possibility of negative rates as worries grew that the U.S. central bank would need to take extra steps to stimulate the economy.
Friday's jobs report overturned this expectation, with the contracts now showing no probability of negative rates over the coming three years.
“The market thinks that we’ve reached a turning point. There is an expectation that rates could push higher in the near-term,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York.
Long-dated Treasury yields jumped to more than two-month highs this week as optimism over the economy boosted risk sentiment, and reduced demand for bonds.
Analysts have said that the Fed is unlikely to adopt negative rates on concerns that it would not be effective and would disrupt the large U.S. money markets. Fed officials including Chair Jerome Powell have also pushed back against the prospect.
Investors now appear to have also left the possibility in the rear view mirror.

U.S. unemployment dropped to 13.3% in May from 14.7% in April - defying forecasts for it to approach 20% - as restaurants, bars and other businesses began to reopen and hire back workers let go because of shutdowns meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus. 
Construction, healthcare and retail also added jobs in what proved to be a record monthly employment gain of 2.5 million jobs on the heels of April's record loss of 20.7 million positions.
While it may signal the worst has passed, the data also served up another reminder of U.S. racial inequality at a moment when protests have erupted around the country over police violence against African Americans.
The unemployment rate for black workers edged up to 16.8% in May from 16.7% in April and for Asian workers it rose to 15% from 14.5%. In contrast, unemployment for white workers fell to 12.4% in May from 14.2% in April, a record drop.

The household survey, from which the unemployment rate is derived, showed 3.8 million more Americans at work in May than in April, a 2.9% increase in overall employment. But the gains favored whites over blacks as well, with white employment increasing 3.3% while for African Americans it was rose by just 1.7%.
The statistics are a reminder that employment for black workers tends to rebound more slowly during an economic recovery.
In April, the gap between black and white unemployment widened to 4.4% as the rate dropped for white workers but rose for black workers.

1490,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>","Canada ready to spend C$14 billion to get people back to work safely, PM Trudeau says","By Steve Scherer
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is ready to spend C$14 billion ($10.4 billion) to help people get back to work safely as the coronavirus pandemic restrictions are gradually lifted, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday.
""To really move forward, we need a Canada-wide plan on safely and effectively restarting the economy,"" Trudeau said in his daily news conference. 
The funds are part of a ""safe restart agreement"" with the 13 provinces and territories, which is still being worked on and which will cover the next ""critical six to eight months,"" the prime minister said. 
The Friday announcement signals a shift by the federal government from supporting Canadians and businesses hurt by pandemic closures toward getting the economy rolling again.
The spread of the novel coronavirus in Canada has slowed significantly in the past two weeks, according to public health data, and provinces have been gradually opening back up.
On Friday, coronavirus-related deaths edged up 1.4% from a day earlier to total 7,652, according to official data.
Ottawa is already on track to spend C$300 billion, or 15% of gross domestic product, on wage subsidies, monthly income support for the jobless, and other measures meant to help bridge the crisis. 
Trudeau did not provide a detailed breakdown of how the C$14 billion would be spent. He did say some was for providing personal protective equipment to healthcare workers and to businesses so people can get back to work.
Some money will go to cities and municipalities that have been providing essential services during the pandemic while their revenue has decreased dramatically, Trudeau said, and childcare services would also get some.

It also could help provide sick pay to those who do not now receive it from their employers, and to help seniors and long-term care homes hard hit by the virus.

1491,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>","Pandemic Won’t Alter Supply Chains For Now, Shipping Giant Says","(Bloomberg) -- There will be little change to global supply chains in the aftermath of the coronavirus, at least in the short term, according to the Chief Financial Officer of the world’s third-largest container company.
Marseille-based CMA CGM expects to see a 15% volume contraction in the second quarter, which will be the lowest point of the year, said Michel Sirat in a phone interview on Friday. After that, volumes “should be up in all recovery scenarios.”
“We’re relatively confident about 2020,” he said.
Sirat said that any moves to alter supply chains are likely to be slow and customers will continue to buy goods in China post-pandemic.
The coronavirus revealed weaknesses in global supply networks including a heavy reliance by the auto-parts industry on the Chinese province of Hubei, where the first outbreak occurred. Plant shutdowns there sent global carmakers scrambling for parts, creating havoc within plants around the world.
Sirat was speaking as CMA CGM released first quarter earnings that showed it swung to a net income of $48 million from a $43 million net loss a year earlier. Revenue was $7.19 billion in the first quarter, down 3% compared to the same period of last year, according to a statement. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization jumped 25% to $973 million over the same period, mainly due to cost cutting measures put in place in 2019.
The company recently secured a 1.05 billion euros loan, 70% backed by the French state. The guarantee on the loan came with few conditions apart from a commitment not to issue a dividend this year and to pay suppliers on time, Sirat said.
Early in March, the shipping operator obtained a three-year extension on $535 million of credit lines maturing in 2020.
CMA CGM’s bonds due January 2025 rose 2.4 cents on the euro on Friday, to around 80 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

1492,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>","More State, City Jobs Lost in Two Months Than During Recession","(Bloomberg) -- In the last two months, states and cities have cut more jobs than they did after the last recession.
Even as businesses hired employees back as much of the nation started reopening, the number of workers on state and local government payrolls fell by 571,000 to 18.3 million in May, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday. That pushed the number of job cuts to about 1.5 million over the past two months, roughly twice as many as were ushered in after the last economic contraction over a decade ago.
Many of the job losses may be reversed when idled employees are called back as states reopen schools and their economies. But the steep cuts underscore the deep financial strain on usually slow-to-act states and cities, which are facing massive budget deficits after surging unemployment and business closures decimated their tax collections.
“The main take away is that this is happening because of intense shortfalls on the state and local levels,” said Wesley Tharpe, deputy director of state research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “A lot of the decline we may be seeing may be furloughs, but without additional aid from federal policy makers a lot of those furloughs will become permanent layoffs because states have to balance their budgets.”
Most of the public sector losses where from schools with 373,200 jobs cut last month, which are likely to reverse when students return to classrooms. Outside of education, states cut 20,700 jobs and local governments eliminated 176,900 positions.
Such job cuts, if maintained, could exert a drag on the recovery. States alone are expected to face a $765 billion shortfall over the next three years based on projections by the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities. U.S. cities and towns are projected to lose about $360 billion of revenue through 2022, according to the National League of Cities.
Michigan is requiring state employees to take two days off every two weeks from May 17 to July 25, in order to cut payroll costs by $80 million. The state is expecting a budget gap twice what it suffered during the last recession. New Jersey may have to cut half of its 400,000 state and local employees if the federal government doesn’t help make up a $10.1 billion revenue shortage through June 2021, Governor Phil Murphy said.
Congress hasn’t passed direct aid to states and cities to address their budget shortfalls, with a Democrat-backed plan to provide some $1 trillion stalled.
“It’s going to be a very incomplete recovery, even at the end of 2021, if we don’t deal with the state and local sector,” said Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, in an interview this week.

1493,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>",ECB nemesis Kerber says new scheme may be forbidden aid to debtors,"By Francesco Canepa and Balazs Koranyi
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's new plans to buy massive amounts of government bonds with near total discretion may break a legal ban on bankrolling governments, Markus Kerber, the German academic behind the ECB's biggest court setback, said on Friday.
The ECB on Thursday extended its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) until at least June 2021 and said it would focus its 1.35 trillion euros ($1.53 trillion) firepower on the countries that need it the most to prevent the euro zone's bond market from tearing apart.
This has seen it buy more Italian bonds than Italy's quota would suggest, and ditch a cap on owning more than a third of any one country's bonds. [nL8N2DF498] [nL8N2BJ0QB]
Kerber said the ECB may have crossed a legal red line by easing those two safeguards, which have allowed it to buy 2.2 trillion euros' worth of government bonds since 2015 with the blessing of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). 
""The programme raises a number of questions,"" Kerber said. ""Is this still a temporary programme? Is it compatible with the European Court of Justice’s definition of monetary financing?”
He added the new scheme had ""nothing to do with inflation"" but rather with keeping debt manageable for Italy and other countries.
The ECB is already under legal scrutiny in Germany, whose Constitutional Court has given it three months to justify a separate bond-buying programme, known as Public Sector Purchase Programme (PSPP), or lose the Bundesbank as the main buyer in the scheme. [nL8N2CN2VW]
Kerber, professor of public finance at Berlin's Technical University [nL8N2CN5PH] and one of the plaintiffs behind that case, declined to say if he planned legal action against PEPP.
The ECJ had deemed the PSPP purchases were legal because of the safeguards, which were either relaxed or cut in case of the pandemic purchases, raising the risk that the ECB would lose its biggest legal backers if Kerber or others filed another challenge. 
An ECB spokesman declined to comment. 

""The European Central Bank is subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Justice back in December 2018 has judged that the PSPP – which was also the object of the German constitutional court – was in line with our policy mandate,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said on Thursday.

1494,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>",Ireland speeds up cautious reopening of economy,"By Padraic Halpin and Conor Humphries
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland will accelerate the cautious reopening of its economy, with the fourth and final phase of easing restrictions to start on July 20, three weeks earlier than scheduled, acting Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Friday. 
Facing growing pressure from business to accelerate one of Europe's most conservative reopening plans, Varadkar also confirmed that Ireland would move to phase two next week.
Under the revised schedule, large retailers will be allowed to resume trading from Monday, shopping malls from June 15 and hotels by the end of the month, all ahead of schedule. The final phase, which includes the reopening of pubs that do not serve food, will begin on July 20 instead of Aug. 10.
""Why is now the right time? Because the data is going in the right direction,"" Varadkar told a news conference, referring to consistent falls in the number of cases, hospital admissions and deaths.
Ireland has reported 1,664 deaths related to 25,000 cases of COVID-19, the lung disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
By skipping the queue, hotels join restaurants in reopening from June 29, as Varadkar made a pitch for people to support the ailing domestic tourism sector by ""exploring our country, as if for the first time"".
Anyone entering Ireland is required to self-isolate for 14 days and the government's advice against non-essential overseas travel will remain in place for at least a number of weeks, Varadkar has said.
Ireland's chief medical officer promised to develop specific guidance on social distancing for the hospitality sector in coming days. Customers must currently remain two metres apart.
Data on Friday showed the domestic economy grew at a subdued pace in the first quarter ahead of what Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe expected to be an ""unprecedented contraction"" from April to June.

However, he said up-to-date data points to a gradual recovery. Donohoe extended a wage subsidy scheme till the end of August to help businesses reopen.

Investing.com -- President Donald Trump appeared in the Rose Garden Friday morning to claim victory for an unexpectedly strong May jobs report.
The unemployment rate in May fell to 13.3%, the Labor Department reported on Friday, confounding expectations as hiring rebounded. Economists had predicted the unemployment rate would rise to as much as 20% after reaching 14.7% in April. It is still the highest since the post World War II period, but it sent stocks soaring in early U.S. trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 700 points.
""We're going to be back and we're opening our country,"" he said, adding that he's not sure why some states have lagged behind others in loosening Covid-19 restrictions.
""We're going to be back higher,"" he said. ""The only thing that can stop us is bad policy.""
Employers added 2.5 million jobs last month, contrasting sharply with the loss of 20 million jobs in April amid the Covid-19-related business shutdowns.
“These improvements in the labor market reflected a limited resumption of economic activity that had been curtailed in March and April,” the Labor Department said in a news release.
Trump took to Twitter to celebrate on Friday. ""It's a stupendous number,"" he wrote. ""It's joyous.""


He fired off nine tweets in short order, taking a victory lap for the numbers.


Employment jumped in the sectors that were hardest-hit by the business shutdowns. Leisure and hospitality jobs jumped 1.2 million in May, nearly half the total gain for the month, after jobs in the sector contracted 7.5 million in April. It is not known how much the Paycheck Protection Program, a government assistance program for small businesses meant to encourage employers to keep workers on their payrolls, contributed to the jump in hiring numbers last month."
1496,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>",BA owner considers legal challenge to UK quarantine as relations fray,"By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - The owner of British Airways is considering a legal challenge to Britain's quarantine plan, as relations between airlines and the government are frayed by steps to curb the coronavirus pandemic. 
With planes around the world grounded since late March, airlines had hoped to start flying from July. But Britain's 14-day quarantine, due to be introduced on June 8 for arrivals from abroad, will hamper that recovery, say bosses. 
Willie Walsh, the chief executive of IAG (L:ICAG), said the industry had not been consulted on the quarantine plan and he expected other airlines to consider their legal options too. 
Ryanair (I:RYA) Group CEO Michael O'Leary has described the plan as ""useless"" and a threat to the tourism industry, while Walsh said it would torpedo any return to flying in July.
""We think it is irrational, we think it is disproportionate and we are giving consideration to a legal challenge to this legislation,"" he told Sky News on Friday. 
Britain's big airlines, IAG's British Airways (BA), easyJet (L:EZJ) and Virgin Atlantic, have between them announced almost 20,000 job cuts to prepare for a smaller travel market after the pandemic. 
Relations between BA and the government have come under increasing strain as the crisis has progressed. 
A junior transport minister agreed with a lawmaker on Wednesday who said BA should ""pay a price"" for putting thousands of staff on notice of redundancy while accessing the government's salary support scheme. 
Walsh and the head of BA then declined to attend a meeting with Britain's interior minister on Thursday to discuss quarantine plans.
""Obviously we are disappointed they chose not to attend the meeting,"" a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday.
Walsh wrote to lawmakers on Thursday defending BA's plans to cut up to 12,000 jobs and explaining that, while not flying, BA was burning through about 20 million pounds ($25 million) of cash a day. He said he had not had any contact with transport ministers since March 18. 
Company chiefs and some lawmakers have questioned why the quarantine plan is being brought in now when infection levels across Europe are much lower than they were months ago. 
The government's chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance said on Wednesday that politicians decided the policy, adding quarantines worked best for restricting travel from countries with high infection rates. 
There are hopes that some quarantine requirements could be replaced with air bridges, or bi-lateral agreements between Britain and other countries to allow unrestricted travel. 
IAG shares were up 12% at 1319 GMT, as tourism-related stocks gained on hopes the worst of the crisis is over.

1/CROUCHING TIGER
Have HSBC and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) ""chosen profits over human rights"" in backing China's national security law for Hong Kong, as some suggest? Or does it reflect the tightrope businesses must navigate between Hong Kong's protesters and Beijing? 
U.S. special treatment for Hong Kong is now in doubt as is the city's role as a finance hub. Its position as a major goods trading centre will be threatened if wares become subject to the higher import tariffs paid in mainland China or if U.S. imports no longer enjoy zero rates.
One silver lining may be more IPOs by Chinese firms ditching their New York listings or mainland newcomers debuting in Hong Kong rather than on Nasdaq.
But as Beijing tightens its grip, an American Chamber of Commerce survey showed 30% of respondents were considering moving capital, assets or business operations. Heed Western warnings or stick with Beijing? It's a choice more companies will have to make.

2/STOCK RALLY, YIELDS UP
The U.S. Fed might be watching the steepening Treasury yield curve with trepidation. The steepening -- when longer-dated yields rise faster than short-tenor ones -- signals a brighter growth outlook. But too fast a rise in borrowing costs can strangle economic recovery.
After the June 9-10 FOMC meeting, investors will listen for the Fed's views on the economic outlook; an upbeat tone could further feed the stocks rally and trigger Treasury selling.
That may train more attention on the curve; the 5-year/30-year segment is at the steepest since end-2017, rising around 30 bps in the past month. Few expect Fed action this month but it may well signal additional bond-buying or yield curve control measures ahead

2/TIME FOR EURO BULLS 
If nine straight days of gains for the euro and the tightest Italy/Germany bond spreads in over two months are anything to go by, investors are a whole lot more confident in the euro zone outlook compared with a few weeks ago.
After an initial slow and divided response by politicians and an unfortunate comment on bond spreads from the ECB chief, European authorities suddenly found their feet -- a recovery fund with some form of fiscal burden sharing is taking shape, Germany has agreed more fiscal spending and the ECB has added 600 billion euros to its emergency stimulus.
Further euro gains and tighter bond spreads appear likely, as does a selloff in German bonds as demand for safe havens wanes. The road ahead is long, no doubt. Yet for the first time in years, euro bulls have reason to hope.
(Graphic: A turning point for European markets?, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jznvnbnqgvl/theme0506.png)
4/THE RECKONING
Who's buying? That's the question being asked of China's factories whose output is back to levels seen before the coronavirus crisis shunted or shut down most of the global manufacturing supply chain. 
Sunday's trade data should confirm that global demand for stuff being cranked out by the world's biggest factory remains weak. But any rise in imports, if driven by cheaper oil or raw material purchases, would feed fears of an inventory build-up and worries that manufacturers have been politically pressured to produce.
The coming days might be when investors begin suspecting China will not have any growth this year. That will lead them to gauge how bullish stock markets will react as the unstoppable force of Chinese production runs into an impregnable global downturn.

5/DRY POWDER 
By denting boardroom confidence and ravaging balance sheets, the coronavirus crisis brought a multi-year deal-making boom to a halt; Global M&A activity has plunged 43% this year while global private equity buyouts are down 27%, Refinitiv data shows.
But European M&A activity is bucking the trend with a 12% rise, thanks to some mega-deals such as a 24 billion-pound merger of mobile operators O2 and Virgin Media.
True, the number of announced transactions is 33% below year-ago levels, but bankers see this changing as private equity funds sniff around for troubled businesses in need of cash injections or for resilient listed firms. 
A consortium of KKR, Cinven and Providence has just launched a 2.96 billion-euro bid for Spanish telecoms operator MasMovil -- Europe's first take-private attempt since the crisis struck. CVC Capital Partners is in talks with Italy's Serie A to invest up to 2.2 billion euros into the soccer league's broadcasting rights business, sources say. 
Expect more deals if market confidence continues to build.

1498,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 06:43AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday, June 5th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The U.S. will release its official labor market report for May, and there is a clear risk of an upside surprise after ADP’s better-than-expected numbers on Wednesday (even if that was neutered, in turn, by yesterday’s jobless claims figures). Brent oil futures are back above $41 after reports of a breakthrough in talks with overproducers. The ECB’s latest booster shot of stimulus is driving bond spreads down and stocks up, while underwhelming reports from Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Slack may weigh on tech stocks. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, June 5th.
1. It's payrolls day.
The third of this week’s updates from the U.S. labor market arrives at 8:30 AM ET with the publication of the Labor Department’s monthly report. Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have fallen by 8 million in the month to mid-May, a gentler drop than the 20.5 million seen in April but still a number that points to immeasurable hardship across the country. The jobless rate is expected to rise to a postwar high of 19.7%.
The risk is for an upside surprise – ADP’s assessment of private payrolls on Wednesday suggested a much gentler decline of barely 2 million. However, the  latest instalment of weekly jobless claims numbers on Thursday was a reminder that the trend is turning more slowly than politicians – and stock markets – would like to believe.
2. Euro, Stoxx hit three-month highs after ECB action
European assets are enjoying their moment in the sun, after the European Central Bank padded its emergency bond-buying fund by another 600 billion euros ($680 billion) at its meeting on Thursday.
The euro earlier hit $1.1384, its highest level against the dollar since March 10, but is consolidating now after rallying for 10 days straight since the European Commission announced its own 750 billion program aimed at helping the EU economy recover next year.
Sovereign yield spreads have tightened to their narrowest since March in the wake of the dual initiative by Brussels and Frankfurt, something that is allowing chronically beaten-down bank stocks to lead the current rally.
Earlier Thursday, the German Bundesbank said the stimulus package announced by Berlin on Wednesday would soften the economy’s contraction this year by over 1% of GDP. It still expects a decline of over 7% for 2020, while the ECB sees the euro zone shrinking by 8.7%.
3. OPEC-Russia agrees in principle on deal extension
Crude oil prices jumped again as the so-called OPEC+ group of producers agreed in principle to extend the current level of output restraint by one month, that is, until the end of July.
The group will meet virtually on Saturday to rubber-stamp the agreement, which came after Iraq and Nigeria agreed to improve their compliance with the deal agreed in April at the depths of the collapse in global demand.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 2.2% at $38.24 a barrel, while the global benchmark Brent was up 3.0% at $41.20 a barrel, the first time it’s been above $41 since March 7.
4. Stocks set to open higher on oil news
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher, having turned positive on the back of the news coming out of OPEC. That would cap a remarkably resilient week for stocks, which are now close to recovering pre-pandemic levels as stimulus money continues to find its way into financial assets.
By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 futures contract was up 283 points or 1.1%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was up 0.7% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.3%.
The dollar index, by contrast, appeared to be bottoming out around 96.8 after losing 1.8% over the course of the week, while gold futures were down 1.1% at $1,708.30 a troy ounce.
5. Slack, Broadcom put a question mark over tech valuations
A note of caution could be seen in tech stocks this morning after two disappointing updates from prominent names after the bell on Thursday.
Chipmaker Broadcom warned that it expected the next couple of quarters to be overshadowed by supply chain constraints and a “substantial reset in wireless”, also hinting that it expects the launch of the next generation of iPhones (for which it makes chips) to be delayed.
Separately, messaging service Slack said it had failed to register any acceleration in revenue growth in the last three months, despite perceptions that it was well positioned to profit from the boom in remote working.  Slack’s figures stood in sharp contrast to those released by Zoom Video earlier in the week.
In lighter vein, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) founder Elon Musk called for Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to be broken up after it restricted distribution of a book on the Covid-19 pandemic. "

Without specifying what the measures would be, the Ministry of Commerce issued a statement saying that it opposed moves to make 33 Chinese companies subject to curbs on access to U.S. technology on the grounds that they have ties to the military or are involved in human rights violations.

The U.S. Department of Commerce in May expanded its so-called entities list, which restricts access to American technology and other items, to include 24 Chinese companies and universities it said had ties to the military and another 9 entities it accused of human rights violations in Xinjiang.

1502,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Unfazed by pandemic, Bank of Japan to keep economic recovery view - sources","By Leika Kihara and Takahiko Wada
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is likely to maintain this month its projection that the economy will gradually recover from the damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic in the latter half of this year, sources said.
Such a view would reinforce market expectations that it will forgo bold monetary easing steps at its June rate review, after the BOJ and the government unveiled a slew of support measures for businesses in the last few months.
But it would contrast with the European Central Bank's move on Thursday to offer a bigger-than-expected expansion of its stimulus package to prop up the economy.
The BOJ's optimism reflects its growing conviction that the world's third-largest economy hit bottom in April or May, when lockdown steps kept citizens home and businesses shut, said four sources familiar with the central bank's thinking.
""There aren't enough factors that would force the BOJ to alter its view the economy will emerge from the doldrums in latter half of this year as the pandemic subsides,"" one of the sources said, a view echoed by three other sources.
That stance would reduce the likelihood of interest rate cuts or a massive increase in asset purchases at the BOJ's June 15-16 rate review.
Still, many central bankers warn of risks that could slow the pace of recovery, such as a renewed spike in infections, rising job losses and a bigger-than-expected slump in emerging economies.
""The April-June quarter is probably the bottom for Japan's economy. But the slump in growth may become bigger and the rebound slower than initially thought,"" a second source said.
FUND AID, NOT STIMULUS
The BOJ eased monetary policy for two straight months in April, joining government efforts to cushion the blow from the pandemic on an economy already sliding into deep recession.
Steps so far have focused on easing corporate funding strains, such as increased purchases of corporate debt and the creation of lending facilities to help small firms.
While its U.S. and European counterparts are shifting from crisis response towards steps to reflate growth, the BOJ remains wary of using tools directly aimed at stimulating demand - such as rate cuts - too hastily, the sources said.
That means the BOJ's most likely option, even if it were to act in coming months, would be to expand its lending facility or take new steps to ease stress on companies, they said.
""There's no point trying to stimulate the economy now when the government is still asking people to stay home as much as possible to contain the pandemic,"" a third source said.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced a state of emergency in April requesting citizens to stay home and businesses to close, hammering an economy that was already suffering from the hit from a sales tax hike last year and the U.S.-China trade war.
While Japan lifted lockdown measures in May, analysts expect the economy to contract by an annualised 22% in the current quarter and recover only modestly in the second half of this year.
""Japan's economy will rebound in July-September if there's no renewed spike in infections. Even so, it may take until 2023 or 2024 for the economy to climb back to levels before the pandemic hit,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.

""The BOJ may not need to act now. But if job losses start to spike, it may come under pressure to loosen policy again.""

""Unless we act now, the climate crisis will be tomorrow’s central scenario and, unlike COVID-19, no one will be able to self-isolate from it,"" Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and his French counterpart, François Villeroy de Galhau, wrote in a joint article published in the Guardian newspaper.
They said countries around the world were far from meeting their climate goals and the coronavirus pandemic had shown that reacting to a crisis at its height brought huge costs.
""To address climate breakdown, we can instead take decisions now that reduce emissions in a less disruptive manner. That requires us to be strategic. To build back better,"" they said.
Central banks have increasingly put the risks of climate change into their assessments of the health of the financial services firms that they monitor.
A group representing central bankers and regulators - the Network for Greening the Financial System - will publish climate reference scenarios in the coming weeks which Bailey and Villeroy said would ""raise the bar for the financial sector"".

The article was co-written with Frank Elderson, chair of NGFS who is an executive board member of the central bank of the Netherlands, and with former BoE governor Mark Carney, who is the United Nations' special envoy for climate action and finance.

The European Financial and Economic Crime Centre will be set up within Europol, the EU law enforcement agency, and will employ 65 analysts to gather and share intelligence.
""The fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic has weakened our economy and created new vulnerabilities from which crime can emerge,"" Europol head Catherine De Bolle said, adding the centre would focus on countering money laundering, fraud and corruption, which usually increase in times of economic crisis.
Europol said sectors such as construction, hospitality, travel and tourism are at higher risk of being infiltrated or taken over by criminals during the economic crisis as companies try to survive the downturn. 
It also warned that subsidies offered during the pandemic ""will be targeted by criminals seeking to defraud public funding"". Frauds involving medical equipment are also on the rise.
Europol analysts will help authorities in the 27 EU member states to conduct financial crime investigations and share intelligence.

The unit is also expected to help with the confiscation of criminal profits, just 1% of which are currently seized in Europe, according to Europol estimates.

The euro zone's biggest economy will contract by 7.1% in 2020 based on calendar adjusted figures and 6.8% according to unadjusted data, the Bundesbank said in its biannual projections, days after the government agreed a 130 billion euro stimulus scheme.

(Reuters) - Self-driving technology company Cruise, a unit of General Motors Co’s (N:GM), is trying to poach engineers from struggling rival Zoox Inc, according to an email sent to Zoox engineers by the founder of Cruise this week.
The move comes as the Wall Street Journal reported last week that e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) is in advanced talks to buy Zoox, a company founded six years ago and based in Silicon Valley. 
""Cruise is willing to recognize the full value of the rewards you’ve earned at Zoox - something that is very unlikely to occur via an acquisition in this environment,” said the email from Cruise founder Kyle Vogt sent in the past two days, according to a person who has seen the email. Reuters has not seen a copy of it.
Cruise on Thursday confirmed the email was sent. ""We're going after the best talent in the world, wherever they may be working and whatever else they might be working on,” said Cruise Chief Communications Officer Kristine Boyden by email.
The person who has seen the email said there was no mention of Amazon in the letter, but that it kicked off by saying: “Writing because your company is potentially about to go through a major transition.” 
Zoox didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Cruise letter to its employees. As of May 12, Zoox had around 1,100 employees, according to data company PitchBook.
California Employment Development Department records show Zoox laid off 87 employees in April.
The source said Cruise has been doubling down on recruiting talent for its core technology and that layoffs in May that impacted over 140 employees was a move to “right size” the organization. The layoffs included staff at an engineering team in Pasadena, California, that worked on lidar, a sensor technology that uses pulsed laser light to sense objects.
Still, Cruise in April acquired a German radar company Astyx that has about 60 employees, the company confirmed on Thursday.
Cruise has also hired many engineers this year from self-driving truck firm Starsky Robotics which shut down in March, according to two former Starsky engineers and information posted by engineers on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).

""I think the business case for doing it is very strong,"" Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said on a tourism industry webcast. 
""The aircraft are not going anywhere,"" he added. ""When we are comfortable in doing it and have the financial strength to do it, we will be doing it.""
Before the coronavirus pandemic, the airline had planned this year to order up to 12 Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A350-1000 planes to allow Sydney-London and Sydney-New York flights by 2023. 
The airline has since grounded 220 planes and halted all international flying with the exception of government repatriation charters and cargo flights.
Qantas on Thursday said it would triple domestic capacity to 15% of normal levels by the end of the month, with the potential to rise to 40% of normal in July if state border restrictions ease.
Joyce said the outlook for international travel was less clear and would depend on countries' getting COVID-19 under control or a vaccine being developed.
Australia, which has few COVID-19 cases, has barred its citizens from almost all outbound travel. 
Joyce said that was likely to boost demand for holidays in domestic destinations like Cairns and Broome, and that Qantas would offer low fares to help stimulate demand and reduce the A$40 million ($27.76 million) monthly cash burn from planes sitting on the ground.

1514,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 08:45PM ET</span>",Mega Rally in Philippine Bonds Has Room to Run Along With Peso,"(Bloomberg) -- Philippine bonds are hitting a sweet spot.
After turning out to be the stars of emerging Asia this year, a strengthening peso, proactive central bank and demand from local lenders is putting them on course for more gains.
The nation’s sovereign debt has returned 10% since the start of January, while joint second-place holders Taiwan and India have only risen 2%. This year’s rally in peso bonds follows a 27% gain in 2019, versus 7% for emerging-Asian bonds as a whole.
A key driver for further gains is likely to be demand from local banks deploying funds freed up by a lower reserve requirement ratio. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas trimmed the measure by 2 percentage points in March to cushion the economy from the impact of the coronavirus. The central bank has already signaled another similar-sized reduction by year-end, and has plenty of room to ease further as the ratio of 12% remains the highest in Southeast Asia.
Policy makers also have room to keep yields suppressed by further direct bond purchases. The central bank snapped up 300 billion pesos ($6 billion) of government debt in March under a repurchase agreement, but still has scope to buy another 240 billion pesos until it reaches the maximum allowed under current law. There’s even a proposal to increase the threshold for purchases to 30% of the government’s average revenue from 20%, Governor Benjamin Diokno said this week.
Analysts say the central bank has also been actively buying government bonds in the secondary market, as Diokno flagged in comments in April.
READ: Philippine Central Bank Reassures Investors Over Bond Buying
The shrinking economy may help deliver another boost to bonds as it puts pressure on the central bank to keep easing policy. Policy makers are predicted to trim their benchmark by another 25 basis points this year, building on the 125 basis points of cuts they have already made since January, according to a Bloomberg survey.
The nation’s sovereign debt should also benefit from the prospect of a strengthening local currency.
The peso is likely to rise by year-end due to a weaker dollar and the fact it’s relatively sheltered from yuan weakness arising from U.S.-China tensions, said Terence Wu, a currency strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore.
“Even though the Philippine economy is seeing headwinds in line with the Covid-19 situation, the fundamentals in the form of FX reserves are still improving and this should provide increasing support for the peso,” he said. OCBC, which has been the second-highest ranked peso forecaster for the past two quarters in Bloomberg rankings, predicts the currency will end the year at 49.8 per dollar.
What To Watch

1515,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 08:09PM ET</span>",Europe Unites in Stimulus Zeal Led by Lagarde-Merkel Double Act,"(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s monetary and fiscal titans are finally moving in lockstep as a wave of German stimulus buttressing additional central-bank easing heralds the prospect of a new era of policy making in the region.
Those measures to aid the economic pickup from the coronavirus crisis, announced within half a day of each other in Berlin and Frankfurt, followed a groundbreaking shift toward creating a European recovery fund in Brussels supported by joint borrowing.
Each initiative is already substantial, but combined they’re quite the show of force. They also suggest that Europe, which has long struggled to find common ground over economic policy, is more than ever exhibiting a sense of collective purpose.
“The shift in policy making at the European level has been tremendously significant,” said Neville Hill, chief European economist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in London. “It’s not only capable of allowing the euro-area economy to recover well from the near-term crisis, but it does raise the prospect of a better, and a better-balanced, policy framework in the European Union once it’s recovered.”
At the center are two women who can draw on unique experience of prior financial market turmoil. Germany’s long-serving Chancellor Angela Merkel oversaw two days of bargaining to clinch her latest 130 billion-euro ($147 billion) stimulus push, after bringing her government round to sharing its fiscal might to back the EU’s new borrowing tool.
Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, a former French finance minister and International Monetary Fund chief, has kept her institution at the forefront of crisis firefighting, while bluntly telling governments that it can’t do the job alone. Policy makers expanded bond purchases by 600 billion euros on Thursday, and could still add to that in future.
“The ECB is acting much more aggressively than it has ever done before, and so is the German government,” said Nick Kounis, an economist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam. “The policy response has been much more rapid and coordinated and focused compared to the global financial crisis.”
Some of the debt the ECB will buy will be German -- conveniently issued to pay for the country’s new stimulus. That fiscal-monetary connection is already well underway in countries such as the U.K., where the central bank and government have emphasized their coordination.
A mark of success for euro-area officials came in the form of Italian 10-year bond yields, which dropped to the lowest level in two months on Thursday. That narrowed the spread over German debt that’s long been a warning signal for officials. It had spiked in March, when Lagarde mistakenly suggested the ECB wasn’t interested in keeping it in check.
The emergency that has provoked Europe’s economic actors into changing their ways remains pressing. Lagarde said on Thursday that the region’s contraction in the second quarter will be “unprecedented” -- leading to a near 9% slump this year.
“An ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical,” she added.
57 Measures
Germany -- the region’s biggest economy -- is set to weather that better than partners such as Italy, though officials in Berlin still anticipate the worst loss of output since the aftermath of World War II.
With that in mind, Merkel’s stimulus exceeded expectations. The package, including 57 measures from a sales-tax cut to a bonus for parents, was tailored to ensure as wide a reach as possible.
Such German efforts are turning a page for the country after years of balanced budgets, driven by an orthodoxy of fiscal rectitude. They also mark a faster response than in 2009.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“With the pandemic under control and substantial fiscal support in place, Germany looks well-placed to bounce back in the second half.”
-Jamie Rush. See his GERMANY INSIGHT
Similarly, the ECB has acted swiftly and boldly, in contrast to the slow-motion reaction, punctuated by years of policy wrangling, that followed the financial crisis and subsequent debt turmoil in the region.
Europe’s next frontier for policy making is likely to focus on the EU recovery fund, which will pool borrowing powers with a view to distributing aid as needed.
It’s yet to be endorsed by all governments and could be watered down. But if it takes shape, it will begin to redress an imbalance in the design of the euro, which fused monetary policies without symmetry on the fiscal side.
With “the combination of German fiscal expansion and the EU recovery fund -- as well as nobody talking about austerity despite the big fiscal slippage due to the coronavirus -- finally a joint Europe is coming together,” said Jens Peter Sorensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank A/S.

AfDB President Akinwumi Adesina has been accused of abuse of office by a whistleblower at the bank, including favouritism in hiring. He has denied the allegations and a report by the bank's ethics board cleared him of wrongdoing.
The United States, AfDB's second-largest shareholder, has demanded a new independent probe into the allegations, rejecting the bank's investigation over reservations about the integrity of the bank's process. Meanwhile, top shareholder Nigeria has voiced its support for Adesina.
In a statement, AfDB's board of governors said it believed the bank's ethics committee, which produced the report, had carried out its role correctly. But the board has nevertheless agreed to authorise a review.
""The independent review shall be conducted by a neutral high caliber individual with unquestionable experience, high international reputation and integrity,"" it said.
On Tuesday, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari gave his backing to Adesina in his bid for a second term as AfDB president despite the allegations.
Adesina later this year plans to pursue a second term as the head of the multilateral lender, which is headquartered in Ivory Coast's commercial capital Abidjan.
The board said the review of the investigation would take no more than four weeks and not interfere with the bank's electoral calendar.

The bank's whistle-blowing and complaints handling policy will also be reviewed at a later date to ensure it is being properly implemented, it said.

The International Alliance for Responsible Drinking (IARD), made up of 12 major alcoholic beverage companies, said its survey of 11,000 people found that 30% were drinking less than before, and 11% were drinking more.
The global numbers were skewed by figures from South Africa, which banned alcohol during the pandemic, and Mexico, which imposed tight restrictions on it. In both those countries most people are drinking less and only a tiny fraction drinking more.
But even in other countries, more people said they had cut back on alcohol than increased it.
In France, 29% of people are drinking less and only 10% drinking more. Similar effects, if less pronounced, were observed in Germany, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and, to a lesser extent, the United States.
Britain was the exception, where the figures were almost the same: 21% drinking less and 19% drinking more, despite the total shutdown of pubs and bars.
When shutdowns began, consumers in many countries stockpiled alcohol along with other goods.
Alcohol sales at U.S. retailers shot up by 54% in the week after the country entered a state of national emergency. They subsided a bit, but still remained higher than before: market research firm Nielsen said the overall sales increase for the 12 weeks to May 23 was 27%.

The study by the IARD, whose members include brewer  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) and sprits specialists  Diageo  (L:DGE) and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), was carried out on May 13-21. Non-drinkers were excluded from the figures.

1520,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 06:10PM ET</span>","As New Zealand prepares for negative rates, kiwi acquires yen's stripes","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - New Zealand once boasted one of the world's highest-yielding currencies, making it a favourite for investors chasing income - now, growing prospects of negative interest rates at home have lumped the kiwi with Japan's safe and boring yen.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's policy rates have already plunged from 8.25% before the 2008 financial crisis to a mere 0.25% now.
The central bank seems set to take them negative, to lower borrowing costs for banks and businesses and stimulate an economy reeling from the coronavirus.
That spells a sharp turnaround for the kiwi and the investment-grade New Zealand bond market, both of which have been classic ""carry"" trades,"" where investors borrow in low-yielding currencies such as the yen or the euro for riskier yet higher yielding assets.
Frank Jasper, who manages investments for New Zealand-based Fisher Funds, is now looking to rebalance his portfolio as kiwi-denominated assets lose their lustre.
""For the first time in my life, gold could have a role to play in our portfolios,"" he added.
Although traditionally an asset sought during times of crisis and downturns, the precious metal has risen 12% so far this year, even as riskier assets have rallied.
Investors such as Jasper are already diversifying significantly, he said, pouring money into emerging market debt and currencies.
""Most clients will have to take some additional risk in their portfolios,"" Jasper told Reuters. ""We have had to pivot away from heavily weighing on government bonds, like we usually do, towards having relatively high grade corporate bonds.""
If the RBNZ does adopt negative rates, New Zealand would join Japan, Sweden, Denmark and other European countries that have done the same, removing a lucrative market for yield-hungry investors.
The U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England are also seen toying with the idea. 
Japanese investors, who traditionally invest in Australia and New Zealand for their high yields, say they may have to buy longer-term kiwi bonds, if at all, to get any income.
""The New Zealand yield curve will end up looking like the Japanese yield curve. This means we can’t make that much money, but we won’t be losing money either,"" said Akira Takei, a global fixed income fund manager at Asset Management One in Tokyo.

RISK ON, RISK OFF
The kiwi has traditionally been a proxy for economic growth, one that would appreciate when the macro backdrop was positive and encouraged risk-taking or yield-hunting.
Under negative rates, it might behave more like the yen, becoming a currency that's backed by an extremely dovish central bank. 
""Under normal circumstances we would call for the kiwi to strengthen during periods of market optimism. However, the ultra-dovish stance of the RBNZ may prevent it from performing well,"" said Charalambos Pissourous, Cyprus-based senior market analyst at JFD Group.
""It may be the only risk-linked currency that could underperform even during risk-on periods.""
Already, the kiwi has underperformed its Australian cousin (AUDNZD=R), slipping more than than 8.0% between mid-March and mid-May, led by central bank policy divergence between the two countries with Australia ruling out negative rates as a policy option.
These factors could also hit liquidity. Although New Zealand's economy is nominally ranked around the world's 50th largest, its free-floating currency is the 10th most traded, thanks to its historic yield advantage and its financial markets being among the first to open in Asia.
Fergus McDonald, Head of Bonds and Currency at Nikko AM NZ, believes negative rates, if they happen, would support some local assets but also drive some funds offshore.

""Equity and property markets should also move higher,"" he told Reuters. ""We would expect an ongoing rotation out of bond and cash assets to areas that have a higher earning capacity.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday rejected Bernard Madoff's request to be released early from prison because he was dying of kidney failure, saying the swindler has never fully accepted responsibility for his massive, decades-long Ponzi scheme.
Circuit Judge Denny Chin, who called Madoff's crimes ""extraordinarily evil"" when imposing a 150-year sentence in June 2009, wrote that while Madoff's failing health was ""most unfortunate,"" compassionate release was unwarranted.
""When I sentenced Mr. Madoff in 2009, it was fully my intent that he live out the rest of his life in prison,"" Chin wrote. ""Nothing has happened in the 11 years since to change my thinking.""
The judge called Madoff's fraud ""one of the egregious financial crimes of our time.""
Madoff's lawyer, Brandon Sample, expressed disappointment that Chin found Madoff ""beyond redemption,"" and said his client's last hope was for President Donald Trump to commute his sentence.
Sample has said Madoff, 82, used a wheelchair and had fewer than 18 months to live. The U.S. government opposed early release.
Prosecutors said Madoff used his firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, to swindle thousands of individuals, charities, pension funds and hedge funds, including many with ties to the Jewish community.
A court-appointed trustee estimated Madoff's customers lost $17.5 billion, of which $14.3 billion has been recovered.
Madoff was arrested in December 2008 after admitting his fraud to his sons, and pleaded guilty to 11 criminal counts.
About 500 of the 520 victims who wrote to Chin opposed early release, and the judge said Madoff has appeared in public comments to blame them.

AMMAN (Reuters) - The Syrian pound hit a record low on Thursday over fears of the impact of tougher U.S. sanctions this month and the repercussions of a seizure of assets of a leading tycoon on the war-battered economy, dealers, traders and businessmen said. 
Traders said it cost as much as 2,050 Syrian pounds to buy one dollar on the street on Thursday. The pound closed slightly higher at 1,900 on Wednesday after rapid declines this week. It fluctuated around 1,500 pounds to the dollar just a week ago.
The pound had traded at 47 to the dollar before protests against President Bashar al-Assad's authoritarian rule erupted in March 2011.
Dealers said panic selling of pounds was sparked by fears of how the new wave of U.S. sanctions might affect the economy. The Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Law, which takes effect this month, penalises foreign companies dealing with Syrian firms associated with Assad's government.
Sentiment has also been hurt by Syria's recent seizure of assets - including hotels, banks and mobile operator Syriatel - belonging to Assad's cousin, Rami Makhlouf, one of the country's richest men.
The pound's fall has paralysed business activity, with many merchants and trading firms now reluctant to sell or buy in a market where the currency was declining by 5-10% daily, according to investors contacted by phone from Damascus.
The collapse of the currency has driven up inflation and aggravated hardship as Syrians struggle to afford food, power and other basics.

The pound’s decline has accelerated since mid-October when the financial crisis in neighboring Lebanon choked off a main source of foreign currency inflows.International sanctions against Syria, damage to the country’s industry from the fighting, and an exodus of money by panicked Syrians had pushed the currency sharply lower during the conflict, now in its ninth year.

The country had seen some of its strongest growth streaks in the past few years after leaving behind the 2010-13 economic and debt crisis, and the recession predicted by the government is still slightly less steep than the 7.7% decline for all of the euro zone forecasted by the European Commission last month.
Last year, Portugal's gross domestic product grew 2.2% while unemployment was 6.5%, near record lows. The economy is heavily dependent on tourism, which accounts for up to 15% of GDP and has suffered from the coronavirus lockdowns in Portugal and abroad.
Costa said that in the three months since the start of the epidemic and subsequent restrictions, about 100,000 Portuguese lost their jobs and 800,000 were furloughed.
""The only way to recover from this crisis is by resuming economic activity,"" Costa told a news briefing after a cabinet meeting that approved, among other measures, a six-month extension of a moratorium on banking loan repayments until March 2021, and more state-guaranteed loans for companies.
The suspension, in place since March, can be applied on bank loans to companies and individuals, including on household mortgages and is designed to avoid jeopardising the banking system with a jump in bad loans.

The government will also double state-guaranteed credit lines for companies to 13 billion euros ($14.73 billion).

(Reuters) - U.S. trade credit insurers have approached the U.S. Treasury Department and Federal Reserve seeking financial backing for claims payments to support business supply chains hit by the novel coronavirus pandemic, three people familiar with the matter said.
Trade credit insurance, which covers $600 billion in U.S. business transactions annually, protects businesses selling goods and services from the risk that insolvent buyers will not pay them. Washington lobbyist David Ross spoke with Steven Seitz, director of the Treasury's Federal Insurance Office on a May 27 call about support for the niche industry, James Daly, chief executive officer of Euler Hermes Americas, an Allianz SE unit (DE:ALVG), told Reuters.
Trade credit insurers want about $60 billion in government support, as shared claims payouts, Daly said. Policyholders would pay additional premiums for the backing.
Ross, a lawyer with WilmerHale, also had a May 26 call with the Fed about support, Daly said.
Two additional sources confirmed the meetings.
Ross did not respond to requests for comment.
Trade credit insurers are the latest industry to seek federal backing for losses related to pandemic lockdowns that have sparked mass unemployment and bankruptcies.
Small and mid-sized businesses comprise 60% of U.S. customers for the industry, which also has sought government backing from other nations. The insurers hope to avoid rate hikes and trimming coverage as rising bankruptcies make non-payment risks dicier to insure. 
U.S. insurers have reduced coverage they offer by 10% to 15%, figures that could reach 20% to 25% percent, Daly said. Rates have increased on average by 10%.
""We're not looking for a bailout,"" Daly said. ""What's good for the economy is to maintain the coverage in the supply chain, just like banks need help to continue lending.""
France, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain are among the countries backing trade credit insurers.

“On the structural changes, China has done a pretty good job,” Lighthizer said Thursday during a virtual event held by the Economic Club of New York. “And we’ve seen significant purchases over the course of the last many weeks.”
On Monday and Tuesday of this week, China bought $185 million worth of U.S. soybeans, he said, refuting a report that Beijing wasn’t living up to its commitments on the commodity purchases.
His comments come as tensions between the U.S. and China have escalated in recent weeks, throwing into question the stability of the initial trade agreement. President Donald Trump has blamed the Asian nation for misleading the world about the scale and risk of the coronavirus outbreak and Beijing’s crackdown on Hong Kong has further deteriorated relations.
Industrial Policy
The pandemic shows why the U.S. should have an industrial policy, Lighthizer said, to ensure that America can manufacture domestically the supplies it needs including medical equipment and protective gear.
He said the coronavirus crisis will change the trade relationship between the U.S. and China, India and other countries, as the Trump administration is seeking to reshore supply chains, particularly in the medical space.
“After the crisis is over we have to have an industrial policy that assures the United States has in any future crisis the ability to manufacture at home all the things that we need,” he said. “We need a policy, be it subsidies, or tariffs, or whatever it takes. We have to have an industrial policy so we never find ourselves in this position again.”
Separately, he said he’s not in favor of the U.S. pulling out of the World Trade Organization, which has become a court for disputes instead of a venue for negotiations. The WTO has also become a lightning rod of criticism for the Trump administration, which argues that China has not fulfilled its 2001 commitments to embrace a more market-oriented economy.
U.S. trade in goods and services plunged in April to the lowest level in almost a decade as the Covid-19 pandemic stifled demand and hindered logistics. Foreign trade was already easing prior to the virus outbreak and has worsened as businesses shuttered around the world to stem the spread and supply-chains were disrupted.
Even so, Lighthizer remained optimistic.
“One thing I can promise,” he said. “Trade will come back.”

Almost two-thirds of households in the greater Los Angeles area experienced earnings declines over the past two months compared with 43% in Washington, D.C., where federal-government jobs have been largely protected, according to a new report by the U.S. Census Bureau. In New York City, more than half of residents suffered a drop in income.
Income Losses
Here’s a look at how Americas largest 10 metros have varied:
The pandemic has affected people with lower incomes to a much greater degree than top earners. Generally, those able to work from home have held onto jobs during the sheltering-in-place orders -- a feat not possible for most lower-paying service, retail and blue-collar positions.
Hispanic households experienced the largest income drops in seven of the largest 10 metros, followed by African Americans who saw earnings declines of more than 60% in half of the 10 largest metros.
In all 10 of the largest metros, a larger share of those with more education were able to sustain their incomes. But, the differences vary. In Dallas 67.8% of households with only a high-school education saw earnings fall compared to 45.4% in Houston.
Most people with at least a college degree were able to maintain their salaries in all 10 metros. And less than of third of such households saw incomes fall in Boston, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.
As school buildings shut down, many parents had to spent more time caring for children and less time working. In all 10 metros, households with kids fared worse in maintaining income levels compared with childless homes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is set warn American investors on Thursday against 'fraudulent' accounting practices of China-based companies and will suggest the Nasdaq's recent decision to tighten listing rules for such players should be a model for all other exchanges around the world.
His remarks on the issue, expected to be delivered later on Thursday and reviewed by Reuters, illustrate the Trump administration's desire to make it harder for some Chinese companies to trade on exchanges outside of China.
It also represents the latest flashpoint in the relationship between Washington and Beijing at a time of escalating tensions between the world's two largest economies over trade, the handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as a spat over Hong Kong.
President Donald Trump on Friday said his administration would begin the process of eliminating special U.S. treatment for Hong Kong to punish China, saying Beijing's move to impose new national security legislation meant the territory no longer warranted U.S. economic privileges.
Many U.S.-listed Chinese firms will likely list on the Hong Kong exchange this year in part because of U.S. political pressure, the head of that exchange said Thursday.
Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) took action last month and tightened listing rules, in a bid to curb initial public offerings of Chinese companies closely held by insiders and with opaque accounting.
Nasdaq declined to comment on Thursday.
The tightening of listing standards came after Chinese coffeehouse chain  Luckin Coffee  Inc (O:LK), which had a U.S. IPO in early 2019, announced that an internal investigation showed its chief operating officer and other employees fabricated sales deals.
""The real issue is the lack of transparency and the lack of disclosure to the American investors,"" Keith Krach, undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment at the U.S. State Department, told Reuters on Wednesday.
""No country should be allowed to lie to the American investors to create an unfair advantage, especially when operating in American markets,"" Krach said, adding that there was a push within the administration to make U.S. investors more aware about China's opaque accounting practices.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been locked in a decade-long struggle with the Chinese government to inspect audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies. The regulator’s accounting oversight arm, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), is still unable to access those critical records, it has said.
In April, the head of the SEC, Jay Clayton, warned investors against putting money into Chinese companies due to ongoing problems with those companies’ disclosures. 
A senior U.S. official said he hoped the SEC would review a 2013 memorandum of understanding signed with China to allow Chinese companies to not share information if their local laws forbid them from doing so.

""That waiver should probably be reviewed at this point in time as to whether it is still appropriate and if not be rescinded,"" he said, adding that the decision was up to the SEC.

PARIS (Reuters) - France will spend an extra billion euros on a programme to boost apprenticeships in French companies as part of new measures to soften the impact of the coronavirus crisis on employment. 
The extra state support for the apprentice scheme -- one of the government's unsung successes before the crisis hit -- was announced after President Emmanuel Macron met with trade unions and employers at the Elysee palace.
""We had historic growth in apprenticeships. We can't sacrifice the young generation,"" Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud said after the talks.
State support for hiring apprentices under 18 years of age will be raised to 5,000 euros from 4,125 euros and for apprentices 18 years or over to 8,000 euros from 5,125 euros.
France is keen to avoid a wave of layoffs and is also betting on a German-inspired scheme to financially encourage firms to keep workers on their books, reducing their hours instead of cutting jobs.
""What's at stake is to save jobs and skills,"" Penicaud said, adding that the terms of the new scheme will be unveiled within two weeks.
Keeping workers in their jobs, even with reduced hours, would help preserve skills and allow for a quicker rebound once demand for French products picks up again, presidential advisers say. 
Macron moved quickly to transform the job market in the first years of his presidency, making it easier to hire and fire workers in a bid to cut an unemployment rate that had historically remained high even in good times. 
His aim, before the coronavirus crisis, was to bring it down to 7% by the end of his mandate in 2022. Containing the rise in unemployment will however be a key factor in Macron's possible re-election bid.

1531,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 01:55PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Bond investors look for Fed to justify steepening yield curve,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Expectations that the global economy has dodged the worst-case scenarios for the coronavirus pandemic have led to a dramatic selloff in U.S. government bonds from their record highs, pushing the yield curve to its steepest level since March. 
Investors will get a chance next week to see whether the U.S. Federal Reserve agrees with their optimism. The U.S. central bank is expected to hold a two-day meeting that will conclude Wednesday, the first since a meeting in April in which Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the U.S. economy could feel the weight of the economic shutdown for more than a year. 
While the Fed could introduce additional bond-buying programs known as quantitative easing or yield-curve control measures to target short-term rates, some fund managers say they expect that yields would need to rise significantly from here to justify any intervention in the bulk of the curve. Instead, they are watching for hints that the central bank believes the worst part of the coronavirus crisis has passed. 
""They are really in this transition phase,"" said Eric Stein, co-director of global income and portfolio manager at  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV). ""Markets are functioning, if not all the way back to pre-shock levels, with very strong debt issuance and market improvement, even though the real economy is incredibly weak.""
As a result, Stein is looking for signs the Fed believes the economic rebound can support the rise in yields. 
""The Fed will be okay with a slow creep higher, particularly with a backdrop of a recovery, but if it moves too much and destabilizes the recovery, there's a reason for concern,"" he said. 
Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, expects the Fed to focus on its newly announced Main Street Lending Program, meant to support small- and medium-sized businesses facing financial strain because of the pandemic, as opposed to introducing significant new stimulus measures.
""The Fed is likely to communicate that there is more scope for fiscal measures but that is a very uncomfortable spot to be in,"" he said. ""We won't have a clear sense of direction of the economy until well into the fourth quarter because all the sequential data now is massively positive."" 
The manufacturing ISM index rose to 43.1 in May from 41.5 in April, while weekly jobless claims fell to 1.877 million from 2.126 million the week before. 
""Recent economic reports in the U.S. have been uniformly weak, though not any worse than expected,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI),senior U.S. economist at NatWest Markets. 
Eddy Vataru, lead portfolio manager at Osterweis Capital Management, said the larger risk for the Fed is that rates remain too low, making it unlikely that there will be a significant push for yield curve-control measures. 
""We can now discredit the worst outcomes of the virus. The sentiment around the risks around the virus have really changed,"" he said, pointing to declining infection and fatality rates in coronavirus hot spots such as the New York City region. 
As a result, he is moving into corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities and shying away from Treasuries, which he said have ""no investment value"" at their current yields. 
""At the end of the day, we have a ton of stimulus, both fiscal and monetary, and the markets have reacted to it,"" he said.

1532,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 12:18PM ET</span>",Even Negative-Rate Veterans Are Struggling With Bond Choices,"(Bloomberg) -- Japanese bond investors are better accustomed than most at trying to eke out returns in a negative-yield environment. But they’re struggling with a dwindling pool of attractive options, which doesn’t bode well for international peers who might be looking to use a similar toolkit.
While money managers globally have snapped up a recent flood of supply to fund trillions of dollars worth of stimulus packages, the shrinking returns on fixed-income instruments are making it increasingly hard to earn decent returns. Funds in Japan have long sought better returns from higher-yielding debt abroad. But even after a recent tumble in currency hedging costs, the choices out there aren’t as wide-ranging as one might think.
Except for U.S. corporate bonds, South African sovereign debt and Italian securities, not a whole lot of markets offer a big step-up in yield premium to Japan’s offerings, according to Bloomberg’s analysis. For those prepared to consider other alternatives, there are also Australian semi-government securities as well as Malaysian and Singaporean sovereign notes.
After accounting for hedging costs, South African sovereign bonds offer a yield of 4.5% for the yen-based investor, the highest among 27 markets analyzed by Bloomberg. This was followed by U.S. corporate debt at 1.8% and Italian government bonds at 1.7%.
A majority of the markets analyzed had hedged yields below 1%, while yields in the U.K., Germany and Sweden were negative. In comparison, Japan’s 20-year bond pays 0.37%.
“U.S. corporate and mortgage debt will be among the top options for Japanese investors,” said Eiji Dohke, chief bond strategist at SBI Securities Co. in Tokyo. “They must be finding these securities easier to buy given the Federal Reserve is investing so much to ease U.S. credit.”
This preference is reflected in the latest data. Japanese funds bought the most American corporate debt in eight years in March and purchased a record amount of U.S. agency bonds while selling Treasuries.
The Fed has rolled out a series of emergency programs to stave off a credit crunch after the pandemic roiled global markets. Measures include buying U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds invested in corporate bonds as well as purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.
Bloomberg’s analysis shows selected European bonds also offer relatively high currency-hedged yields. But the debt may have lost some of their appeal after Germany’s constitutional court questioned the legality of one of the European Central Bank’s asset-purchase programs.
“I don’t think Japanese real money is keen to take risk in European bonds,” said Eiichiro Miura, general manager of the fixed-income department at Nissay Asset Management Corp. “Debt is ballooning in Europe and the German supreme court’s decision is a cause for concern. In particular, risks remain high for Italian bonds.”
Currency-hedged U.S. corporate bonds delivered a return of 2.5% for Japanese investors so far this year, while euro zone securities lost 2.2%, according to Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) indexes. The Asian nation’s government debt dropped 0.6%.
Data Methodology
The table below shows yields on 10-year notes that make up the FTSE World Government Bond Index as well as select quasi-government and corporate bonds. The countries’ names refer to their government debt.
For Japan, 20-year yields were used because of the preference of life insurers and pension funds for long-dated bonds in the local market.
Hedging costs were computed using currency forwards and assume that hedging would be rolled over every three months. Credit ratings are based on S&P Global Ratings.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro jumped to a three-month high and Italy's borrowing costs tumbled on Thursday after the European Central Bank revved up stimulus to shore up an economy ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic.
The ECB said it would increase the size of emergency bond purchases by 600 billion euros ($674 billion) to 1.35 trillion euros, more than the 500 billion-euro increase many analysts expected.
The central bank added that purchases would run until the end of June 2021, six month longer than originally planned, and that it would reinvest bonds maturing in its pandemic emergency purchase scheme at least until the end of 2022. 
""It did as expected and this is naturally an additional relief for the sovereign spreads of these (weaker euro zone)countries and for the euro,"" said Didier Saint-Georges, managing director at Carmignac.
The euro rallied to three-month highs just above $1.13 (EUR=EBS) and was last up 0.75% on the day. It has gained for eight consecutive sessions.
ECB policymakers debated expanding their emergency bond purchases by between 500 billion euros ($566 billion) and 750 billion euros on Thursday before settling for a compromise figure, three sources told Reuters.
​(Graphic: Euro zone markets react to ECB, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnvwybwevw/ECBJUNETHIS%20ONE.PNG) 
Italy led a rally in southern European bond markets, with 10-year yields tumbling more than 15 basis points to 1.38% (IT10YT=RR) - their lowest since late March. They notched up their biggest one-day fall since May 18. 
The gap between 10-year Italian and German bond yields was at its tightest since late March at around 170 bps (DE10IT10=RR).
Spanish and Portuguese 10-year bond yields fell about 7 bps each (ES10YT=RR) (PT10YT=RR). Greek bond yields tumbled more than 10 bps to their lowest levels since early March (GR10YT=RR). 
European stock markets see-sawed, with a broad measure of European stocks down 0.75% (STOXX). 
""Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday were a great run with the expectation of additional easing. We got that and now it seems that traders are taking the money off the table for now,"" said CMC Markets analyst David Madden.
Banking stocks rallied, however, with an index of euro zone banking stocks gaining more than 1% (SX7E).
(Graphic: Euro zone markets react to ECB, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnvwybwevw/ECBJUNETHIS%20ONE.PNG)
In a further sign that more stimulus was shoring up investor sentiment, safe-haven German bond yields rose and a key long-term gauge of the market's inflation expectations hit a three-month high above 1.07% .
The yield on Germany's 20-year bond turned positive for the first time since late January, briefly rising to 0.017% (DE20YT=RR).
""What's different from the GFC (global financial crisis) is it's clear that central banks are willing to go faster in terms of stimulus, willing to go bigger and for longer. The ECB today is part of that,"" said Jack McIntyre, fixed income portfolio manager at Brandywine Global. 

""The fact they are talking about keeping stimulus in place until June next year is pretty good. And it isn't only about monetary policy. It is about fiscal stimulus, too. So you are getting a big one-two punch.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy may have hit its low point in the coronavirus crash but the rebound so far remains tepid, according to both broad indexes of activity and higher frequency counts of cellphone data and employee time information.
Indicators of retail foot traffic continued climbing last week. Cellphone location data from Unacast showed the nation overall now within around 20% of its 2019 level, and an expanding group of states where traffic is now higher than it was last year.
Last week that group branched from western states that had tended to impose less stringent business limits in response to the pandemic to include midwestern industrial states like Indiana and Wisconsin.
That increase comes with a footnote: Traffic last weekend dropped sharply, and particularly so in states like Minnesota and Georgia where protests against police violence toward African Americans broke out in major cities in response to the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody. 
Cellphone data compiled by Safegraph also showed an increase, but at a slowed pace from the week before.
(For a graphic on U.S. Reopening: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/bdwpkrnxgvm/index.html) 
The coronavirus pandemic has sickened more than 1.8 million in the United States and led to broad restrictions on activity through March and April that pushed the economy into recession and threw millions out of work.
Those restrictions are now being gradually lifted state by state, and as that happens officials are looking for signs of an economic rebound. 
So far the picture is mixed.

1535,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>",Bond Market Flashes Stagflation Alarm After Fed’s Gusher of Cash,"(Bloomberg) -- The bond market is sounding the alarm that the flood of cash that policy makers have unleashed to buoy growth in the face of the pandemic will have potentially painful consequences for the economy.
The Treasuries yield curve is the steepest in three years, with long-maturity rates climbing as the Federal Reserve prints billions of dollars a week to add to its stockpile of government debt and other assets. The steepening phenomenon is typically a signal of improving growth prospects, and riskier assets such as stocks are certainly rallying. Yet some investors are more wary about what it says about inflation expectations, with U.S. activity merely giving a hint of bottoming out from what’s likely the deepest slump in living memory.
The risk that the market is starting to grapple with is that in the pandemic’s wake, stagflation -- a troublesome combination of tepid growth and accelerating inflation -- takes hold in the years ahead and vexes markets as it did in the 1970s. Cash is flooding into funds that invest in inflation-protected securities, and breakeven rates, another gauge of consumer-price expectations, are ticking back higher.
Not that this is all bad, necessarily. The Fed would actually welcome a move away from the deflationary angst that took hold at the peak of the market turmoil in March, as its unprecedented monetary easing is aimed at doing just that. Yet the prospect that inflation will quicken at the same time that job creation sputters is far from ideal. With most bond investors braced for low rates for years to come, the specter of yields finally taking flight could prove perilous.
“The Covid-19 crisis will be remembered for many things, and among them will be the long-awaited return of inflation in developed markets,” said Oliver Harvey, a macro strategist at  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB).
In a world of zero rates, inflation may seem like a distant threat -- and those who worry about it are a minority in the market, with inflation prognosticators having been proven wrong time and time again over the past decade. But it may be the side effect of the pandemic cure being administered by central banks and governments.
The Fed’s balance sheet alone has swelled above $7 trillion from about $4 trillion in early March, and more steps may be coming, such as yield-curve control. Expectations for such a move are contributing to the steepening push.
For Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at Guggenheim Investments, the Fed’s programs propping up the corporate bond market will lead companies to become even more leveraged, reducing productivity and crimping growth.
Corporations’ reliance on Fed support means the central bank will “have to continue providing liquidity to the system until inflation rates pick up to levels that probably would be viewed as unacceptable by most participants of the Fed today,” Minerd said on Bloomberg TV Wednesday. The long-run implication is “a period of stagflation.”
‘Apocalypse Scenario’
The steepening yield curve, coming as equities are surging, looms large on the radar of Kathryn Kaminski, chief research strategist and portfolio manager at AlphaSimplex Group. For her, it warns of growing concern about inflation, a topic she says she’s hearing more buzz about.
“My apocalypse scenario -- whether or not it can happen -- in terms of where we are positioned now is clearly stagflation,” she said. “That would be a reversal of all the trends we’ve been following. I don’t think it’s a short-term scenario, but that’s the scary long-term one.”
The result would be equities remaining on the front foot initially as the economy reflates, then heading lower, bond prices falling, commodities rising and dollar weakness, she said.
The last time stagflation gripped the U.S. in the late 1970s, 30-year yields eventually doubled in a matter of years, on their way to a record high above 15% in the early 1980s. The long bond yields about 1.55% now, up from a historic low of just under 0.7% reached in March.
Telltale Signs
Others are more sanguine about growth, but still see the makings of inflation as global supply chains get clogged.
Telltale signs can be seen in the latest data. Alongside the record decline in a key measure of U.S. consumer prices in April, the cost of food at home surged 2.6% from the prior month, the most since 1974, as Americans stocked up at grocery stores. In the U.K., pet food at one point jumped 26% on an annualized basis, according to Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) calculations.
Fiscal and monetary policy stimulus “in and of itself has a very, very important inflationary dynamic to it,” said Jeffrey Rosenberg, a portfolio manager of BlackRock’s Systematic Multi-Strategy Fund. He sees inflation as a risk starting in about six months, and one that’s will be marked by a steepening curve.
“The Covid crisis is first and foremost a massive, massive supply shock” which then “had morphed into a massive, massive demand shock,” he said.
Even as the curve steepens, market proxies for inflation projections show investors foresee U.S. consumer prices below 2% for decades, although they’re well above their March lows. Forward inflation swap rates in the U.S. and the euro-zone, favored by policy makers for long-run inflation expectations, have also rebounded yet remain below long-term averages.
BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s $20 billion iShares TIPS ETF added more than $700 million last month, the most in more than two years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
U.S. inflation markets are too pessimistic, says Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
“The market’s view should be intolerable at the Fed,” Cabana said. “They will have to be credible in keeping rates low to generate upside inflation risk premium. That could be highly inflationary.”
He’s advising clients to wager that the gap between five- and 30-year yields will widen as a way to hedge that risk.
Deglobalized, Depressed
Structurally, decades of globalized supply chains that stifled inflation may be at an impasse, with economists buzzing about the potential for what’s known as re-shoring and the resulting depressed global economy. For Yale University economist Stephen Roach, this backdrop combined with the growing debt pile bodes for higher inflation in the years ahead.
“When you couple the trend of offshoring to re-shoring with a likely resurgence of pent-up consumer demand if we get a vaccine, you have a lethal combination of higher costs,”’ said Roach, who famously warned about the U.S. housing bubble more than a decade ago at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), among other bearish predictions.
“And the job destruction occurring is set to be a lasting feature of this post-Covid world,” he said. “Without labor income from employment, the recovery is going to fall short and that is the stag part of the stagflation scenario.”

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",EU considers broadening scrutiny of foreign investments,"By Robin Emmott and Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's executive has proposed broadening scrutiny of foreign investments in the bloc, according to a public draft document, part of efforts to shield more sectors from potential Chinese buyers.
Oversight of some foreign investments in EU states will begin in October, and the European Commission has proposed widening the scope, via a legal act, to new projects on defence, satellite communications and nuclear energy.
The draft, which will be adopted if EU governments do not block it by June 15, marks the latest step in EU efforts to resist what Brussels sees as predatory, state-backed Chinese competition to dominate industries and absorb EU know-how.
EU governments are also frustrated that China has not followed up a formal offer last year to open up its economy. 
An EU-China summit planned for September has been postponed, in part because of the COVID-19 pandemic but also because of EU frustration at a lack of progress on increasing European investment in China.
From Oct. 11, when foreign takeovers are announced, EU governments will be obliged to share details with the Commission in areas such as the media, transport and communications.
If expanded, the review would include more projects linked to defence, a new EU satellite communications programme and a multi-billion-euro nuclear fusion project. 
Projects already on the list include transport, energy and Galileo, the EU satellite navigation programme.
""The Commission has found that there are several other projects and programmes...which are essential for security or public order and which should therefore also be included,"" the draft regulation said.
Transferring technologies to a non-EU country is seen as a risk to the bloc's strategic interests in some technology that Chinese state-led firms have sought to acquire.

However, some EU nations that promote greater free trade may object. Others which have benefited from Chinese investment at home may also oppose the step.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>",Algeria pins hopes on oil prices to avert cuts and renewed unrest,"By Lamine Chikhi
ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria faces one of the biggest fiscal crises of any oil producer as a result of slumping energy prices, but after major political protests last year the government is trying to avoid big spending cuts that could stoke more dissent.
It has not said much about how it will save money and has increased spending to deal with a global pandemic that has crushed oil demand.
Its approach reflects a government view that the lower oil prices are cyclical and will stay between $40 and $45 this year, enough to avert harsh cuts, a senior source at state oil company Sonatrach said.
Algeria already faced a looming fiscal crunch thanks to years of lower energy revenues and a weak private sector. But reforms could aggravate the country's political crisis.
Although the government and parliament publicly acknowledge the need for long-term measures to reduce deficits, they are also facing the biggest challenge to state authority since a civil war in the 1990s. 
Any explosion in youth unemployment or cuts in lavish social support could bring more unrest. 
""This approach has worked in the past, but the big unknowns this time are how long oil prices stay low and how long the impact of the coronavirus pandemic will last,"" said Geoff Porter, a North Africa specialist and owner of NARCO consulting. 
Weekly protests from February 2019 brought down president Abdelaziz Bouteflika after two decades in power. The mass demonstrations continued until authorities imposed a coronavirus lockdown. 
This has left Bouteflika's successor, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, with few options to fix Algeria's budget without triggering more unrest. 
Food subsidies will not be touched although fuel prices have been raised slightly. The government is offering debt and tax holidays and an $80 cash handout to needy families. 
""Losses of firms are being assessed. We are ready to provide financial support. Even self-employed people such as taxi drivers and hairdressers will be helped,"" Tebboune said.
Tebboune's government has promised big spending cuts in a series of increasingly restrictive budgets for this year announced over recent months. 
However, while they have detailed a halt in public sector hiring, they have revealed few other details of how money will be saved beyond promising less corruption after the arrest of some senior officials for graft. 
A freeze in big construction projects, for example, is officially linked to the coronavirus lockdown rather than the fiscal squeeze, and officials say it will end after the country reopens. 
Tebboune has also promised not to turn to the International Monetary Fund, a move that would be unpopular after the country's struggles in the 1990s to repay debts run up during an earlier collapse in energy revenue. 
Instead he says Algeria has been offered help from ""friendly countries"". He did not say who, but a government source said China had offered financial aid. 
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman mentioned medical aid Beijing had sent during the coronavirus crisis and said the countries were ""traditionally friends, and have a comprehensive strategic partnership"". 
BURNING THROUGH RESERVES
The Sonatrach source said the government expects the price of Algerian Saharan blend, now about $39 a barrel after falling to $14.69 in April, to stay in a range of $40-45 this year, enough to stave off catastrophe for now. 
The forecast assumes the price will rebound after lockdowns around the world are lifted, the source said. 
The Energy Ministry did not respond to requests for comment on whether prices would recover to $40-45 a barrel this year. 
However, even if prices do rise by that much, it would do little to head off Algeria's longer-term fiscal problems.
The government needs $100 a barrel to balance its budget at recent spending levels. Since the oil price dropped in 2014 it has funded deficits by burning through more than half its foreign currency reserves. 
Before 2014, it had revenues of $60 billion a year. They fell to $30 billion last year, and are expected to be at around $20 billion this year, the finance minister says.
Adding to Algeria's revenue difficulties, energy sales have fallen as a result of poor field development, rising local consumption and increased competition in European markets. 
Algeria still has reserves of $60 billion and minimal public debt. Food imports cost around $9 billion a year. The government believes it can cover necessities for two years at current spending levels before going into debt, a government source said.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 09:50AM ET</span>",ECB boosts pandemic stimulus to 1.35 trillion euros,"By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank approved a bigger-than-expected expansion of its stimulus package on Thursday to prop up an economy plunged by the coronavirus pandemic into its worst recession since World War Two. 
Just months after a first raft of crisis measures, the ECB said it would raise bond purchases by 600 billion euros ($674 billion) to 1.35 trillion euros and that purchases would run at least until end-June 2021, six months longer than first planned.
It also said it would reinvest proceeds from maturing bonds in its pandemic emergency purchase scheme at least until the end of 2022. 
ECB President Christine Lagarde scotched speculation that the bank could follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in buying sub-investment grade bonds, however, saying that option was not even discussed by policymakers.
The announcement, which comes just weeks after Germany's Constitutional Court ruled that the ECB had already been exceeding its mandate with a longstanding asset purchase programme, prompted a rally in the euro and bond markets.
""Today's easing measures were another illustration that the ECB means business and stands ready to do whatever is necessary to help the euro area survive the corona crisis in one piece. The ECB will do its part, and it hopes the governments will do their part,"" Nordea analysts said in a note.
The bank dramatically revised downward its baseline scenario for euro zone output this year to a contraction of 8.7% from the modest 0.8% rise it had forecast only in March. 
It predicted a partial rebound with growth of 5.2% next year and 3.3% in 2022 but Lagarde told a news conference that signs of any recovery so far were ""tepid"" and that risks to its baseline projection were on the downside.
""The euro area economy is experiencing an unprecedented contraction. There has been an abrupt drop in economic activity as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the measures taken to contain it,"" Lagarde said.
She said she was confident that a ""good solution"" could be found on the legal stand-off with Germany's top court.
As the economic downturn runs deeper and longer than expected, governments are running record deficits to cushion the impact of the pandemic, putting a greater burden on the ECB to soak up this new debt and keep borrowing costs manageable. 
Lagarde welcomed what she called the ""ambitious"" proposal of the European Commission for a 1.1 trillion euro budget for the bloc for 2021-27 with an extra recovery fund worth 750 billion euros.
Cash-rich Germany, which can borrow at negative rates for up to 20 years, separately unveiled a 130 billion euro ($145.85 billion) stimulus package late on Wednesday. 
The ECB earlier committed to buying up to 1.1 trillion euros worth of bonds this year. But even record purchases have struggled to bring down yields on debt issued by countries on the 19-nation bloc's periphery, particularly Italy, hit hard by the virus and already struggling with a large debt burden.

More bond buys are also becoming urgent because the ECB is on track to exhaust its purchase quota by the autumn, raising some doubts about its capacity or willingness to buy the amounts needed to keep yields down.

(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) said on Thursday it is forming a new strategic advisory group within its investment bank.
The new group of roughly 80 bankers merges the Financial Strategy Group and the Shareholder Advisory and Data Science group and will be lead by Muir Paterson who has been running Citi's activist defense group.
In addition to shareholder defense, the group will leverage its data capabilities to serve a broader set of clients and offer insights into client's asset bases, corporate finance structure and tax strategies, executives told Reuters. 
""Bringing these businesses closer together will help scale their respective impact and harness our intellectual capital more effectively,"" the global heads of Citigroup's Banking, Capital Markets and Advisory Group Tyler Dickson and Manolo Falcó said in a memo to staff.
This year the number of campaigns launched by activists fell by 40% due to the coronavirus pandemic but companies remain concerned about potential proxy battles since activists have recently launched campaigns against larger companies such as AT&T.
""Our shareholder advisory group has been helping clients look beyond the near-term to assess their potential vulnerabilities from a defense perspective, as well as consider opportunities for potential growth and M&A as the market slowly finds some stability,"" Paterson said in a statement.
Rivals such as  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) have also launched initiatives to fuse shareholder defense and data science in recent years.

Last year, Goldman Sachs and  Morgan Stanley  (S:MS) ranked as the top two advisors for companies targeted by activist investors. Citigroup did not make the top 10.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets watchdog has begun asking 13,000 firms how close are they to going bust because of the coronavirus pandemic to avoid being saddled with unexpectedly ""lumpy"" compensation bills.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will send the questionnaire to firms like financial advisers and wealth funds, its executive director of supervision, Megan Butler, said on Thursday.
""One of the key reasons...is to help us get a really strong sense of the financial wellbeing of this industry so we can understand who are most proximate to failure,"" Butler told a webinar held by financial advice industry body PIMFA.
""Then we can size the potential harm associated with that.""
Any compensation due to investors would be partly paid by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which is accountable to the FCA.
FCA interim CEO Christopher Woolard has said that not all the firms the watchdog regulates will survive the pandemic.
Butler warned financial advisors that she was seeing ""unacceptable"" practices continuing as fraudsters take advantage of the pandemic.
Some firms were trying to avoid their liabilities to investors by closing down and opening new companies, while others were pre-emptively setting up new companies before complaints about an existing firm crystalised, she said.
""A recent and particularly egregious development is the practice of advisors leaving financial advice firms that have run up liabilities... only to re-emerge in claims management firms to pursue claims against the advice they themselves had given.""
PIMFA CEO Liz Field said such practices were totally unacceptable.
The FCA has announced in advance the exact email addresses it will use to send the questionnaire to avoid concerns that it was part of a scam to obtain sensitive data.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's banks face a tough few quarters as the coronavirus crisis and weak oil prices put pressure on profitability and loan growth, banking executives told Reuters.
But they said strong capital buffers would help them weather the storm.
""This crisis is not going to be over in a very short period of time,"" David Dew, managing director of Saudi British Bank (SABB) (SE:1060), the kingdom's third-biggest lender by assets, told Reuters.
""The second and probably third quarters will remain challenging and 2020 will be a tough year.""
Ammar Alkhudairy, chairman of the country's fourth biggest bank, Samba Financial Group (SE:1090), said profitability would be pressured by lower net interest margins, and possibly higher non-performing loans (NPLs), among other things.
""The margin compression will cause us, as well as all other banks, some profitability deterioration,"" he said, adding that the bank made extra NPL provisions in the first quarter. 
Central bank data shows Saudi banks' profit declined by an annual 38.4% in April to 2.9 billion riyals ($773 million), while Rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said they face a weakening operating environment and cut the outlook on those lenders it rates to negative.
The central bank has provided 50 billion riyals to support banking sector liquidity, and both executives said the proactive measure would help them support private sector companies, especially those facing disruption from the pandemic.
However, bank lending to the private sector is expected to grow just 1% during 2020, Al Rajhi Capital said in a recent report.
""Given the economic situation, maybe loan growth is not the number one priority for banks right now,"" Samba's Alkhudairy said, adding that he expected mortgage financing to continue growing strongly.

The ECB increased the size of its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) to 1.35 trillion euros ($1.52 trillion) from 750 billion euros and extended it until June 2021 at the earliest, with a pledge to reinvest proceeds until at least the end of 2022.
The move was designed to provide breathing space to governments running large budget deficits to dull the impact of the worst recession since World War Two. 
""In response to the pandemic-related downward revision to inflation over the projection horizon, the PEPP expansion will further ease the general monetary policy stance, supporting funding conditions in the real economy, especially for businesses and households,"" the ECB said. 
Euro zone businesses suffered another devastating contraction in activity in May and while there are signs the worst is over, it could be months before there is a return to growth, a survey showed on Wednesday.
But financial markets have been markedly more optimistic in recent weeks, with euro zone shares now less than 20% below their February peak, in a sign investors were betting on a return to normal in the coming months.
Hope for a pan-European recovery fund and a raft of ECB easing measures since March, including massive purchases of commercial paper, have also helped restore sentiment.
Thursday's decision leaves the ECB's benchmark Deposit Facility Rate at -0.5%, meaning banks are charged that annual rate for parking idle cash at the central bank.
The rate on the ECB's Main Refinancing Operations, which banks can tap to obtain one-week credit from the central bank, was left at zero while the rate on overnight liquidity was fixed at 0.25%.

ECB President Christine Lagarde will hold an online news conference at 1330 GMT.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar is likely to slip in coming months as a collapse in global trade and the prospect of a more prolonged slowdown from the coronavirus pandemic put pressure on the currency, a Reuters poll of analysts showed.
The loonie has rebounded nearly 9% since reaching a four-year low in March as investors became optimistic that once lockdowns on households and businesses were eased, a strong recovery in global economic activity would be particularly beneficial for Canada's export-dependent economy.
But some analysts polled by Reuters in the June 1-3 monthly foreign exchange poll say that bout of optimism may have run its course for now. 
""Maybe a lot of the good news is already in the CAD price,"" said Mazen Issa, a senior FX strategist at TD Securities. ""Expectations for a V-shaped (recovery) I think are going to be sorely misplaced and in that kind of environment CAD might struggle.""
In a V-shaped recovery, activity climbs sharply back to its previous peak.
While forecasts for the Canadian dollar were raised from the May poll, the currency was expected to weaken 2.9% to 1.39 in one month from about 1.35 on Wednesday. It was then expected to climb back to 1.37 in six months and 1.35 in one year.
The Bank of Canada on Wednesday said the outlook for the second half of the year and beyond is ""heavily clouded."" It estimates second-quarter gross domestic product will fall 10% to 20% further after dropping 2.1% in the first quarter compared with the final quarter of 2019.
""We believe there's still a lot of ground to cover before economic activity returns to pre-pandemic levels,"" said Hendrix Vachon, a senior economist at Desjardins. ""Cautious optimism seems appropriate."" 
The central bank has slashed interest rates to near zero and begun for the first time a large-scale bond-buying program, while Ottawa is rolling out about C$300 billion in support measures, or 15% of GDP.
But structural economic factors, such as a record level of household debt and a dependence on oil exports, could be an impediment to the recovery, particularly if relations between the United States and China deteriorate.
""We are in a world where trade disruption will be generally in place,"" TD's Issa said. ""Longer-term, I think there are a lot of fundamental concerns that lean negative for the CAD.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Markets have recovered their poise after bouts of extreme volatility in March caused by the coronavirus pandemic that left ""hard questions"" for policymakers to answer, a senior Bank of England official said on Thursday.
""Financial markets could come under strain again if there is another leg to the global infection cycle, or if economic data come out persistently worse than expected,"" Andrew Hauser, the BoE's executive director for markets, told a Bloomberg webinar.
Hauser said policymakers need to look at how markets can amplify the ""dash for cash"" seen in March and April.
""First, do we understand why intermediaries struggled to make effective markets in core government bond, money and foreign exchange instruments at crucial moments during the crisis?"" Hauser said.
Policymakers should also ask themselves if they are comfortable with the core role played by heavily indebted but thinly capitalised non-banks in markets.
""Third, how do we deal with the risks posed to financial stability by the structural tendency for money market and some other open-ended funds to be prone to runs,"" Hauser said.
""How can we ensure timely transition away from Libor, whose weaknesses were highlighted so starkly by the crisis?""
Markets have had to absorb huge policy interventions to ease economic fallout from the pandemic. That included the BoE cutting interest rates to just 10 basis points, raising expectations of negative rates.
""Even if you saw it was the right thing to do, it's not going to happen in the near term,"" Hauser said. ""It's on the retail side and banking side that we need to think more about it, and no decisions have been made about that either way.""
Hauser said public intervention intentionally lifted assets from very low levels, but the central bank does not want to replace the role of markets in pricing and would come up with an ""exit path"" once the economy is strong enough.
""We had to do it, it was the right thing to do. It worked and we have to deal with the consequences of that later.""

1547,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>","Germany finally splurges, but not without fresh criticism","By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - Under pressure from its European peers for years to spend more, Germany has finally served up a bumper stimulus package financed with new debt, but Berlin's rediscovered love to splurge is causing fresh unease among its neighbours.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition presented stimulus measures worth 130 billion euros ($146 billion) late on Wednesday to speed up the recovery of Europe's largest economy from the coronavirus pandemic.
The package, which follows a 750-billion-euro rescue package agreed in March, includes a temporary cut in value-added tax, cash handouts for parents, more funds for small firms and bigger incentives to buy electric cars.
The package of extra spending and tax cuts is equivalent to roughly 4% of Germany's expected economic output in 2020, increasing its overall discretionary national fiscal push to 14%. Together with liquidity aid and loan guarantees, Berlin's coronavirus response equals more than 30% of economic output.
The measures are expected to push up Germany's debt-to-GDP ratio from roughly 60% in 2019 to at least 75% in 2020, a leap in German borrowing not seen since a massive stimulus boost during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.
""The package shows once again that Germany is ready and able to spend when it matters,"" Berenberg economist Holger Schmieding said.
As Germany's measures go substantially beyond any other national emergency programmes from euro zone peers, the sheer scale of its new spending splurge has raised concerns that the discrepancy in aid could increase imbalances in the European Union and distort the bloc's single market.
Germany alone accounts for just under half of the emergency coronavirus state aid approved by the EU executive, adding to concerns that those countries with the deepest pockets might be getting an advantage.
""There is plenty of tensions about state aid being doled out by member states, in particular by Germany,"" a European diplomat said recently in the wake of the 9-billion-euro bailout for Germany's flagship carrier Lufthansa (DE:LHAG).
In Germany, this response evokes confusion.
""The criticism is a bit paradoxical and sometimes even disingenuous,"" a senior German government official said.
""Before the coronavirus crisis, we were the austerity Germans who were always spending too little. Now, we are the 'big spender' Germans who are trying to buy competitive advantages with their deep pockets.""
German officials also say that other European countries will benefit from Berlin's stimulus push as strengthened domestic demand will automatically suck in more imports from French, Italian or Spanish producers.
In addition, Germany is generally backing plans for the European Commission to raise joint debt on an unprecedented scale of possibly up to 750 billion euros and use this money to prop up economies hammered by the coronavirus pandemic.
As part of this envisaged European Recovery Fund, the European Commission has adopted a solvency instrument to level the playing field among member states.

""This solvency instrument is shaped to support the private sector to invest in healthy companies who need liquidity or investment, so that we rebalance the unbalancing that has happened,"" a senior EU official said.

BRUSSELS/BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany, set to take over the European Union's rotating presidency on July 1, will put the rule of law at the heart of the bloc's economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, a policy note said in an apparent swipe at Poland and Hungary.
Germany will take the EU helm for six months as the 27 member states debate a mass stimulus programme to kickstart growth on the continent amidst a series of feuds that could hold up the required unanimous agreement. 
Lines in the sand against making access to EU funds conditional on rule of law standards have already been drawn by Poland and Hungary, whose populist, eurosceptic governments have outraged other member states and rights groups by placing media, judges and academics under closer state control.
""The plan for recovery must be based on solidarity, cohesion and convergence...while fully respecting our values, rights, and the rule of law,"" said the note, seen by Reuters.
It was also signed by Slovenia and Portugal, which will take over the EU baton for six months each in 2021.
The 27 EU member states will first lock horns on June 19 over a recovery proposal by the bloc's executive to raise an unprecedented 750 billion euros worth of debt to top up spending from joint coffers to be worth 1.1 trillion euros in 2021-27.
Under the scheme, the executive European Commission could recommend suspending or withdrawing funds from a country flouting the rule of law, with a majority of EU states needed to block any such punishment. 
That system would make it harder for Warsaw, Budapest or any other perceived offender to avoid forfeiture, compared to an earlier plan that would require a majority to vote in favour of any sanction proposed by the Commission for it to be enacted.
Pressure from the European Union, rights groups and international watchdogs has largely failed, however, to prevent an erosion of democratic checks and balances in the formerly communist eastern members of the bloc in recent years. 
Other disputes over the proposed stimulus package include divisions between the EU wealthier northern countries and the financially ailing south over how to raise the money, how to spend it and, eventually, how to pay it back.

Investing.com -- The European Central Bank is expected to bolster its crisis-fighting bond purchase plan, while the U.S. gets its weekly check on the labor market with initial and continuing jobless claims (as well as April's trade balance). Stocks are pausing for breath after roaring ahead on Wednesday, but they're still mostly unfazed by the wave of protests that continued in more muted form yesterday - the fireworks came mainly from Defense Secretaries past and present distancing themselves from their commander-in-chief. Germany agreed another big economic stimulus package that put consumers ahead of car producers, and oil prices are slipping amid accusations of free-riding on the current deal on output restraint. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, June 4th.
1. Initial jobless claims set to fall below 2 million
The U.S. gets its weekly check on the state of the labor market at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), with the market looking for further evidence that the situation is improving after the pandemic-driven collapse in April. The numbers are essentially the most up-to-date data the market has on the job situation, given that both ADP’s and the Labor Department’s payrolls reports this week only cover the period through the middle of the previous month.
Analysts expect 1.8 million initial jobless claims for last week, which would be the first time it had fallen below 2 million since late March. The continuing claims number is expected to fall by 1 million to just over 20 million.
The U.S. will also publish its trade balance data for April, which will likely show continued drops in both exports and imports.
2. ECB expected to add stimulus; Germany approves 130 billion euro support package
The European Central Bank is expected to increase the size of at least one of its bond-buying programs at its regular governing council meeting, providing further support to a Eurozone economy that it expects to shrink by at least 8% this year.
Analysts expect the bank to add another 500 billion euros to its 750 billion euro ($840 billion) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, which it has used to cap sovereign spreads and ensure overall market liquidity since March.  Some also think it possible that the ECB will expand its asset purchases to include junk-rated corporate debt, following the Federal Reserve’s step in that direction.
The decisions are due at 7:45 AM ET, with President Christine Lagarde’s press conference following at 8:30 AM.
The euro zone got an indirect boost overnight as the German government agreed a 130 billion-euro stimulus package that will include cuts on value-added tax but no wholesale car scrappage scheme. The euro edged lower to $1.12, having risen ahead of the news.
3. Stocks set to open lower, consolidating after strong gains
U.S. stocks are set to open lower, consolidating after a breakneck rally driven largely by the fear of missing performance benchmarks as cyclical stocks recover from the oversold levels of March.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract was down 128 points or 0.5%, while the S&P 500 Futures was down 0.5% and the Nasdaq 100 Futures contract was down 0.2%.
The ongoing relief rally has brought the Nasdaq to within a couple of percentage points of its all-time highs, on perceptions that the pandemic has accelerated the economy’s structural long-term shift towards online and remote business. That didn’t stop Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR) stock from falling sharply in after-hours trade on Wednesday after its results missed elevated expectations.
Of interest after the bell will be results from retailer Gap (NYSE:GPS) and chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).
4. U.S. protests continue as Esper, Mattis rebuke Trump 
A second night of relative calm in U.S. cities was overshadowed by a public rupture between President Donald Trump and both the serving Defense Secretary and his predecessor.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper disagreed on Wednesday with Trump’s threat to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act and send combat troops to patrol American cities, saying the National Guard was better placed to restore order on the streets.
Meanwhile, James Mattis, who served as Defense Secretary from 2017 to January 2019, wrote in The Atlantic that “We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution.” He wrote that the majority of protesters were seeking Equal Justice Under Law, as provided for by the constitution, and that “we must not be distracted by a small number of lawbreakers.”
A Monmouth University poll carried by the Wall Street Journal suggested that Trump had slipped further behind his presumptive rival in November’s election, Joe Biden, in the course of the week.
5. Oil slips as Russia protests Iraqi quota-busting
Oil prices slipped as Saudi Arabia and Russia put pressure on quota-cheats to put their houses in order before committing to an extension of the current deal on output restraint.
By 6:30 AM, U.S. crude futures were down 1.5% at $36.72 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 0.7% at $39.51.
An initiative to move up next week’s scheduled ‘OPEC+’ meeting appears to have run into the sand, given the failure of Iraq to agree to rein in its overproduction. Saudi Arabia and Russia, the two most important players in the OPEC+ bloc, have signalled they only want to extend the current deal by one month, rather than the three months that some in the market had hoped for."

By Jesse Cohen
 
Investing.com - U.S. stock markets have been on a tear this week, with the Nasdaq Composite, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all close to overtaking their all-time highs reached in February.
 
Markets have climbed a virtual wall of worry to head higher over the past several sessions, shrugging off sometimes violent mass protests across the United States over police brutality and racial inequality.
 
At current levels, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is less than 2% away from its record high. The index has rallied more than 46% from an intraday low set on March 23, when coronavirus-related lockdowns shocked the stock market.
 


 
Meanwhile, the S&P (NYSE:SPY) 500 is 8% below its all-time peak, while the Dow is about 11% away from notching another record high.
 
Both indexes are up more than 40% above their March 23 lows as signs of recovery from a coronavirus-forced recession, optimism over a COVID-19 vaccine and a barrage of stimulus from the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government boosted risk appetite.
 


 
However, stocks’ recent strength still leaves the Dow down roughly 8% in 2020. The S&P 500 is off around 3% for the year, while the Nasdaq is up almost 8%.

1554,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>",U.S. Jobless Claims Understate Reality With Gaps in Federal Data,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Labor Department’s weekly jobless claims report has yet to reflect at least half a million filings for a federal pandemic program, with data reporting lagging behind payouts.
Florida, Alabama, Arizona, Hawaii and West Virginia are among 18 states that showed zero initial claims under pandemic unemployment assistance, or PUA, in the Labor Department’s weekly report last Thursday. But the same states have actually received at least half a million in combined claims through the program -- established by the CARES Act -- which is aimed at helping those typically not eligible for regular state benefits, including the self-employed and gig workers.
The gulf between the Labor Department’s data and state numbers -- compiled by Bloomberg News through state press releases, comments by officials and related data -- indicates the labor-market hit from the coronavirus may be more widespread than thought. While it doesn’t significantly alter the overall picture of mass unemployment as tens of millions of Americans have filed for benefits since mid-March, the undercounting further complicates closely watched data already beset by other errors and distortions.
The weekly claims report “does give a pretty incomplete picture of exactly what unemployment looks like right now, and not even necessarily how many people have lost jobs, but how many people are just not earning an income that they were used to earning before,” said  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). economist Veronica Clark.
The figures out each week have gained renewed attention for showing the depth of the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic, as well as signs that a recovery is starting as business restrictions ease. The latest data, due Thursday -- ahead of the May payrolls report out Friday -- are set to show initial claims slowed to 1.8 million last week.
Read more:
“States have been focusing on implementing the new programs and working through unprecedented claims volumes and some of the newer reporting has been delayed by the efforts to get benefits to the claimants that need them,” a spokesperson for the Labor Department said in an email. The agency added that the abilities to report in the first few weeks and months of a new emergency program “typically vary across states and the current situation is no exception.”
Bloomberg’s compilation of at least half a million uncounted PUA claims is based in part on applications filed since the week ended May 23, which covered the most recent federal report issued last week.
The Labor Department’s weekly report tracks an overall figure of initial PUA claims filed in any given week, but it’s based on incomplete data -- in fact, just 32 states in last week’s report, for a total of 1.19 million in the week ended May 23. Any state that doesn’t report data that week is labeled with a zero.
The department said it’s working with states to gather the missing figures to include in the weekly tally.
The PUA claims are separate from the more widely-watched headline figure on initial claims in regular state programs, which were 2.12 million in the week ended May 23.
New Systems
When the CARES Act created the PUA program in late March, state unemployment offices often had to create entirely new systems and portals to accept and administer the benefits.
Alaska, which has received more than 10,000 of these claims, approached the new program in three stages, according to Clifford Napier, assistant director of unemployment insurance at Alaska’s Division of Employment and Training Services. The state is accepting PUA applications, and paying them out, but just not reporting the activities yet, said Napier, who expects work on the program for PUA data reporting to be complete either this week or next week.
A spokesperson for Alabama’s Department of Labor said the state has had some unspecified challenges reporting the figures to the U.S. Labor Department, but hopes to have the issues resolved this week. Over a six-week period, the state received more than 55,500 initial claims for PUA benefits.
Another issue occurs when state numbers for PUA claims aren’t readily available at the beginning of the week. That’s what happened with Maine’s figure in last week’s report, according to Jessica Picard, a spokesperson for the Maine Department of Labor.
The result: the federal report showed zero initial PUA claims from Maine for the week ended May 23, even though Maine later reported it had 20,500 for that week.

Under the plans, unveiled late on Wednesday as part of a larger 130 billion euro boost to the economy, Germany eyes hydrogen capacity of up to 5 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, with a further 5 GW to be installed by 2040 at the latest. 
That will cost about 7 billion euros, while a further 2 billion euros is to be spent on forging partnerships with countries where hydrogen can be efficiently produced.
""The measures are aimed at making Germany the world's supplier of state-of-the-art hydrogen technology,"" the stimulus paper said, adding the government would explore the creation of a European hydrogen initiative to accelerate expansion.
A fully mapped out strategy will be presented shortly, the government said. Both parties have so far failed to reach an agreement on all issues.
The stimulus package also sets fixed prices for Germany's renewable energy surcharge, the EEG, under which power consumers help fund the country's solar and wind power expansion and which accounts for about a fifth of their electricity bill.
The EEG will fall to 6.5 euro cents per kilowatt hour in 2021 and 6.0 euro cents in 2022, the paper said, compared with 6.76 euro cents this year.

1556,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 04:25AM ET</span>",World food price index hits 17-month low in May: U.N.,"ROME (Reuters) - World food prices fell for a fourth consecutive month in May, hit by the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic which has stymied demand, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) food priceindex, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals,oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 162.5 points last month, down 1.9% on April.
It was the lowest monthly reading since December 2018.
The dairy index dropped 7.3%, led by sharp falls in both butter and cheese, partly because of lower import demand.
The cereal price index slipped 1% as coarse grain prices continued their decline, with U.S. maize prices some 16% down on the year, and wheat export prices falling, amid expectations of ample global supplies. International rice prices edged higher.
Vegetable oil prices fell 2.8% to a 10-month low, while the meat index slipped 0.8%. Poultry and pig meat quotations continued to fall, reflecting high export availabilities and despite an increase in import demand in East Asia. 
Bucking the general downward trend, the sugar price index jumped 7.4% in April largely because of lower-than-expected harvests in some major producers, notably India and Thailand.
FAO also posted its first forecast for the 2020 cereal season, foreseeing global output of 2.780 billion tonnes -- a 2.6% increase on 2019's record harvest.
The U.N. agency said maize would account for much of the expected increase, rising a predicted 64.5 million tonnes to 1.207 billion tonnes thanks to anticipated record harvests in the United States, Canada and Ukraine, and near-record harvests in Brazil and Argentina.
Rice production was seen reaching an all-time high of 508.7 million tonnes in 2020, up 1.6% on 2019.

By contrast, global production of wheat in 2020 was forecast to drop, largely on the back of likely falls in the European Union, Ukraine and the United States, which would offset expected increases in Russian and Australia, FAO said.

The BoE's Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulation Authority will gather the data ahead of banks' second quarter earnings to compare the timing and amount of losses with those it modelled last month.
""This information will enable us to identify any significant outliers and to further refine our estimates for future capital exercises,"" Woods said in a letter to banks.
Britain is facing its worst recession in 300 years due to a national lockdown that has shuttered businesses and furloughed millions of employees, with losses on loans to companies set to rocket.
The Bank estimated last month that loan losses at banks could reach 80 billion pounds by the end of 2021, but that lenders are robust enough to maintain the flow of credit to companies and households.
The BoE has already issued guidance on how banks can take into account government relief measures such as loans and repayment holidays on mortgages when calculating expected losses and how much capital should be set aside to cover them.

On Thursday, Woods set out further guidance on how banks should assess the capital and accounting treatment for the three-month holiday on mortagage payments that end this month in some cases ahead of second quarter earnings statements.

Taiwan is one of Asia's major exporters, especially of technology goods, and its export trend is a key gauge of global demand for technology gadgets worldwide.
Forecasts ranged widely from a decline of 11.4% to growth of 3.7% amid uncertainties over the coronavirus outbreak that has disrupted global supply chains and hit growth outlook for the island's tech manufacturers including the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (TW:2330).
Taiwan's exports slipped an on-year 1.3% in April due to the impact from the coronavirus.
Taiwan's economic growth is likely to slow to its weakest in five years in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic hurts domestic consumption and the job market, though strong global demand for electronics could cushion the blow for the trade-reliant island.
Inflation in May was seen at -0.8% from a year earlier, the poll found, a slight improvement on the -0.97% logged in April.

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - People in Hong Kong planned to light candles across the city on Thursday to commemorate the bloody 1989 crackdown by Chinese troops in and around Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ), circumventing a ban on the usual public gathering amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The June 4 anniversary strikes an especially sensitive nerve in the semi-autonomous city this year after Beijing's move last month to impose national security legislation in Hong Kong, which critics fear will crush freedoms in the financial hub.
It also comes as Chinese media and some Beijing officials voiced support for protests across the United States against police brutality. 
In the Chinese capital, security around Tiananmen Square, a popular tourist attraction in the heart of the city, appeared to be tightened on Thursday, with more police visible than on ordinary days.
The Tiananmen crackdown is not officially commemorated in mainland China, where the topic is taboo and any discussion heavily censored. There was no mention of the anniversary in state media on Thursday.
In Hong Kong, an annual candlelight vigil that has been held in the city's Victoria Park for three decades usually draws tens of thousands of people. But police said this week a mass gathering would pose a threat to public health, just as the city reported its first locally transmitted coronavirus cases in weeks.
That prompted vigil organisers to call on residents to light candles across the city instead at 8:00 pm local time (1200 GMT) and hold a minute of silence shortly after. Anyone fearing arrest for public action was encouraged to mark the day on social media using the hashtag #6431truth, referencing the 31th anniversary along with the date.
One Hong Kong student said his parents would not allow him to attend any public gatherings, but he intended to join the online vigil.
""I think we have to restore the truth,"" the 15-year-old, who only gave his surname as Ho due to the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters.
The European Union on Wednesday urged China to allow people in both Hong Kong and Macau, its other semi-autonomous city, to commemorate the crackdown, saying it would be ""a signal that key freedoms continue to be protected.""
Democratically-ruled and Chinese-claimed Taiwan, where commemorations were planned throughout the day, called on China on Wednesday to apologise, a call dismissed by China's foreign ministry as ""nonsense.""
""In China, every year has only 364 days; one day is forgotten,"" Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen wrote on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page on Thursday. ""I hope that in every corner of the earth there won't be any days that are disappeared again. And I wish Hong Kong well.""
China has never provided a full accounting of the 1989 violence. The death toll given by officials days later was about 300, most of them soldiers, but rights groups and witnesses say the death toll could have run into the thousands.
The U.S. State Department said it mourned the victims, adding ""we stand with the people of China who continue to aspire to a government that protects human rights, fundamental  freedoms, and basic human dignity."" 
PLAYS AND FLOWERS 
In Hong Kong, officials have repeatedly said a ban on gatherings of more than eight people is a public health measure with no political motivation. Hong Kong Police urged people in a Facebook post on Wednesday not to participate in prohibited gatherings in order to ""fight"" the coronavirus.
Still, some people said they intended to go to Victoria Park anyway, as volunteers handed out white candles to people making the morning commute.
""When authorities want to suppress us, there are more reasons to speak up,"" said Malissa Chan, 26.

With social distancing measures allowing for religious gatherings under certain conditions, others planned to attend churches and temples. Residents were also expected to lay flowers along a waterfront promenade, while some artists planned to stage short street theatre plays.

About two thirds of the firms in index have announced results for the March quarter so far. Communications, energy and industrials recorded the steepest declines on an adjusted basis.
Stay-at-home measures triggered by the coronavirus pandemic has kept most of India’s 1.3 billion population indoors since late March, leading to a collapse in business activities.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). expects gross domestic product to contract 5% in the fiscal year through March 2021, which would be India’s deepest recession ever. Meanwhile analysts have cut earnings forecasts for the Nifty 50 measure over the next 12 months by 13% since January, as India begins a phased lifting of the lockdown this month.

1564,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 11:11PM ET</span>","From wagyu beef to melons, Japan's $2.2 trillion virus rescue piques struggling firms","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - As the coronavirus jolts Japan, the government's huge stimulus package has come under fire from hard-hit restaurant owners for channelling funds for items like wagyu beef, melons and tourism rather than accelerating help for firms with burning cash needs.
The restaurant industry's struggles highlight a larger problem in Japan's revival plan, which at $2.2 trillion is the size of Italy's economy but is still falling short of sufficient support to an important segment - small businesses which employ 70% of the nation's workforce.
That puts at risk Japan's recovery from the worst postwar recession it is now facing. The $232 billion restaurant industry is crucial to boosting growth as it, together with lodging, creates about 1.3 million new jobs a year, or roughly 17% of all the new employment.
More than 190 small businesses including 30 restaurant operators have gone bust during the current health crisis.
Yet, the government's slow response in pushing through billions of dollars stuck in paperwork is threatening the same fate for many more firms in urgent need of cash to pay salaries and rents.
In contrast, authorities have rapidly pressed ahead with plans to spend nearly $16 billion for a ""go-to"" campaign to promote tourism, and $1.3 billion to help politically powerful farmers and fishermen promote expensive foodstuffs such as mangoes, tunas and yellowtails. An extra $90 million has also been set aside to promote international flights - when almost all planes are grounded.
""We, as well as many others, are running out of money. If the situation is left as is, we will go under one after another. Then, no one will be left to benefit from the tourism campaign,"" said Yoshikazu Moriyama, 42.
Sales at Moriyama's six fish joints called ""IROM Inc."" have tanked 90% and he's struggling to pay rent and salaries for some 100 staff. 
""What we need now is financial support to help us pay rents and compensate for business closures rather than future campaign on tourism,"" Moriyama told Reuters.
Some owners say the government's subsidy of up to $55,000 for each firm to cover rents is insufficient, and that it could afford to do more to keep businesses open and free up cashflow. Last year, rents for all of Japan's restaurants totalled $13 billion - less than the $16 billion going into tourism promotion.
The government's subsidy list includes items such as five-star sirloin Kobe beef steak, which costs some $37.20 for 100g, and top-quality Yubari melon that sells for more than $90 per 1.6-kg fruit.
Agriculture ministry official, Satoru Nishio, said the subsidy, which also covers expensive mangoes, strawberries and tunas, was intended ""to back farmers facing a decline in inbound tourists and exports.""
The government subsidises half of the cost of buying the produce for e-commerce, take-away services and provision of school meals. For example, traders get up to $9.31 per 100g of wagyu beef and up to $22.34 per kilo of melons.
FUNDS TIED UP IN RED TAPE
While a total of $190 billion in financing, loans, cash subsidies and other benefits have been set aside for small businesses, some analysts say struggling firms have been deprived of quick access to much-needed cash due to red tape.
""A government financial agency should provide loans that can be allotted to rents to prevent cashflow from drying up,"" said Kota Matsuda, a former lawmaker who now runs a chain of 30 restaurants including 22 Hawaiian-style restaurants called Eggs 'n Things, employing about 600 workers.
""It's impossible to cover rents solely with subsidies,"" said Matsuda, who has applied for funds but has been frustrated by the cumbersome process as he tries to meet cash needs of more than $650,000 for salaries and $372,370 for rents.
Sales at his restaurants, which reopened fully last Saturday, declined by 90-95% year-on-year in April.
IROM's Moriyama, who applied for a couple of subsidies, said they were ""far from enough"" to make up for the losses.

""I can't foresee what will happen to my business.""

The bloc comprising 15 nations -- Asean countries, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and China -- has been negotiating for several years to form the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, but in November India opted out of the talks. Last month the group wrote a letter seeking India’s return and expressed a willingness to discuss some of its demands.
“What we are trying to do along with other RCEP colleagues is to try to find a way for there to be an on-ramp that allows India an accelerated way back into the agreement,” Vangelis Vitalis, deputy secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, told a parliamentary select committee Thursday in Wellington. “It would be even more important for India to be part of the agreement in the post-Covid space as we see some of the challenges starting to emerge around the region.”
The bloc, which makes up 30% of global trade and 58% of New Zealand exports, hopes to sign the RCEP agreement by the end of the year, he said.
“The message from India has not been very encouraging but from a New Zealand perspective we would like to find a way for India to be a participant,” he said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will give eligible residents A$25,000 ($17,323) to build or significantly renovate their homes, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday, as Canberra moves to revive a construction sector badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
Dubbed HomeBuilder, the package worth A$680 million ($471 million) is Australia's fourth economic stimulus package as it seeks to repair an economy that is now in its first recession in 29 years.
Morrison said the package would support jobs and allow people to build a family home, a long-held dream for many Australians.
""We are going to keep that dream alive for them and the dreams alive of the jobs and the builders and apprentices and tradies (tradespeople), all of those who depend on this critical industry across the country,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra.
In 2019, around 1.15 million people were employed in construction, about 9% of the country's workforce, government data shows.
The scheme though is heavily restricted.
Applicants will have to earn less than A$125,000 if they are single and A$200,000 if they are a couple, with limits on house values and recipients required to spend at least A$150,000 before being eligible.
Still, the government expects 27,000 applications and support the employment of 14,000 construction workers.
“The package will see slabs poured in the second half of the year, meaning jobs are kept and houses built,"" said Graham (NYSE:GHM) Wolfe, managing director of the industry group, Housing Industry Association.
The latest stimulus package comes as COVID-19 cases slow to fewer than 20 a day.
Australia has not reported a death from the disease for more than a week. It has recorded 102 COVID-19 deaths and almost 7,200 infections.

Under the PPP program, loans for restaurants, hotels and other small businesses would convert into federal grants if recipients adhere to a set of conditions, including spending the loan amount within the required time.
Democratic Senator Ben Cardin said that Washington had so far handed out 4.4 million forgivable loans valued at a total of $510 billion. He called it a ""lifeline"" for businesses struggling during the pandemic.
He said gyms, caterers, museums and other small businesses had been particularly hobbled by the eight-week requirement for using the loans and needed more time to carry out the terms of the loans.
A total of $659 billion has been provided by Congress for the loan program, which is part of broader coronavirus emergency aid totaling around $3 trillion so far.
Congress is expected to debate additional assistance in coming weeks, possibly including more federal funds to help state and local governments whose revenues have plummeted amid higher demand for services and social lockdowns.

The bill also gives businesses more flexibility to use the loans to pay for expenses other than payrolls.

1568,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 08:18PM ET</span>","U.K. Services Left Out of Brexit Trade Talks, Think Tank Warns","(Bloomberg) -- Britain’s dominant services industry is being left out of the country’s post-Brexit trade negotiations, putting a large part of the economy at risk of profound damage, according to a report by the U.K. in a Changing Europe.
Services account for 80% of the nation’s economy and about 30 million jobs, yet the government has paid the sector little attention, the think tank based at King’s College, London said on Thursday.
The European Union is the primary destination for Britain’s service exports, and the single market has allowed greater cross-border trade than is typical of free-trade agreements, according to the group.
Even if Britain and the EU strike a trade deal this year, the sector will still suffer and, without one, exporters would face significant barriers because the World Trade Organization’s rules “are much weaker for services than goods,” the think tank found.
Financial services firms would depend on a unilateral EU decision on equivalence, which could be revoked at short notice, it said.
There is also the risk that service industries like finance, health, education and haulage could face staff shortages when free movement of people ends.
“This serves to underline the largely political nature of the government’s Brexit priorities, focused on regulatory autonomy rather than any economic implications,” Anand Menon, the U.K. in a Changing Europe’s director, said in a statement.
Negotiations between the U.K. and its biggest trading partner appear to be deadlocked, with the latest talks set to end Friday without a breakthrough. That raises the risk that Britain will crash out of the bloc without a deal at the year-end -- heaping more pain on businesses already reeling from the coronavirus.

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 07:26PM ET</span>",German coalition parties agree 130 billion euro stimulus package,"By Michael Nienaber and Holger Hansen
BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition on Wednesday agreed a bumper stimulus package to speed up Germany's recovery from the coronavirus
Speaking at a news conference after marathon talks that extended well into the night, Merkel said the package would amount to 130 billion euros ($146 billion) and include lower value-added tax (VAT) to boost consumption.
""The size of the package will amount to 130 billion euros for the years 2020/2021, 120 billion of which will be spent by the federal government,"" Merkel said. ""So we have an economic stimulus package, a package for the future.""
The stimulus programme follows a 750 billion-euro rescue package agreed in March which encompassed a debt-financed supplementary budget of 156 billion euros.
Germany's measures, which together with liquidity aid and loan guarantees equal more than 30% of its economic output, go substantially beyond any other national emergency programmes launched by other euro zone countries.
Merkel said VAT will be reduced from 19% to 16% for six months starting in July 1. A lower VAT rate for hospitality of 7% would be lowered by two points over the same period. The overall cost of the VAT measures amount to 20 billion euros.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said the package will be partly financed by additional net new borrowing. Some 60 billion euros of the 156 billion euros in new debt approved in March have not been tapped, he added.
Germany can afford generous spending splurges given it had a balanced budget since 2014 and had a debt to output ratio of 60% before the pandemic, well below euro zone partners like Italy, Spain and France.
""We can do this because we economised well in recent years,"" said Scholz. ""We want to come out of this crisis with vigour.""
The package also includes at least 10 billion euros a year to help municipalities struggling with lower tax receipts with public spending on infrastructure and housing.
The sheer scale of Germany's new spending splurge has raised concerns among officials from economically weaker countries that the discrepancy in aid measures could worsen imbalances in the bloc and distort the European Union's single market.
The measures also include a one-time, 300-euro stipend per child to help families as well as a doubling of incentives to promote the sale of electric cars.
Germany has weathered the crisis better than many of its European neighbours.
Widespread testing, a robust healthcare system and restrictive measures have helped it keep deaths relatively low. The economic impact of the crisis has also been cushioned by a decision to keep factories and construction sites open as well as generous government financial assistance to businesses and freelancers.
The economy is expected to shrink by 6.3% this year, sinking into its worst recession since World War Two.
In a concession to the SPD, Merkel's conservatives dropped demands for cash incentives to promote the sale of combustion engine cars. The SPD appeared to have partly given up on a 57 billion-euro package to help municipalities, especially those with high debt.

1570,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 07:09PM ET</span>",Asian Virus Hotspot’s Path to World-Beating Growth Looks Tough,"(Bloomberg) -- Until recently feted for its world-beating economic growth, India today is Asia’s coronavirus hotspot, facing a long road out of a crisis that’s left businesses broken and millions jobless.
The blow from a virtual shutdown of a nation of 1.3 billion people has been so severe that economists are struggling to forecast how long it will take to recover. With Asia’s third-largest economy heading for its first full-year contraction in more than four decades -- some say of as much as 5% -- it may be a while yet before India can get back to its halcyon days of 8%-plus growth.
“We believe a catch-up to the pre-crisis trend level of gross domestic product growth will not be possible in the next three fiscal years despite policy support,” said Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist at Crisil Ltd., the local arm of the local arm of S&P Global Ratings. “Under the base case, we estimate a 10% permanent loss to real GDP, assuming average growth of about 7% between in fiscal years 2022 and 2024.”
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists is for a 1.9% contraction in GDP in the fiscal year through March 2021, and a rebound to 7.1% next year.
While 7% expansion would be welcome in most places, that pace isn’t enough to generate jobs for the 10-12 million Indians seeking employment every year. It also hurts Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambition to turn India into a $5 trillion economy by 2025.
Any rebound may be well short of the spurt seen after the global financial crisis more than a decade ago. India expanded at an average of 8.2% in the two fiscal years following the crisis, boosted by massive fiscal spending, monetary easing and a swift global recovery -- all of which played a key role in ensuring a V-shaped recovery.
“To catch-up would require average GDP growth to surge to 11% over the next three fiscals, something that has never happened before,” Crisil’s Joshi added.
Struggle Ahead
To bolster growth, policy makers have extended support in the form of credit guarantees and removed supply-side bottlenecks in various sectors. But direct cash transfers to citizens have been modest, and the central bank’s sharp interest rate cuts and billions of dollars of liquidity have had very little impact on overall demand so far.
Stung by the extent of the slowdown, New Delhi has laid out a path for a phased reopening of the economy, despite a pickup in infections to more than 200,000, making India Asia’s virus hotspot.
That may provide little lift to the economy which is estimated to have lost more than 120 million jobs in April alone.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“Our baseline scenario assumes the nationwide restrictions are rolled back by end-June, step by step. That would leave GDP contracting 4.5% in fiscal 2021, followed by a sharp V-shaped recovery to growth of 12.8% in fiscal 2022. This still results in a cumulative economic loss of 17.6% of GDP over fiscal years 2020-2022 relative to the pre-virus level.”
-- Abhishek Gupta, India economist

“Regarding the time taken by the countries to reach the pre-virus growth levels, the country-wise past recession experience suggests that the recovery in economic activity and the capital formation tends to be slow and it typically takes roughly five to 10 years for real economic activity to reach its former peak level,” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic adviser at State Bank of India in Mumbai.
The lockdown is likely to see corporate India’s revenues and profits slump, leading to a sharp jump in bad loans among lenders and crisis-ridden shadow banks, all of which would hurt capital formation and investment activity. Even consumers, whose spending has been fueled by loans and are a key driver of growth, are unlikely to take on more debt at a time when jobs are uncertain.
Economists like A. Prasanna at ICICI Securities and Primary Dealership Ltd. in Mumbai say that shocks tend to have a longer-lasting impact on future growth in emerging markets than in advanced economies.
“The virus-led disruption to activity and consequent job losses and slowdown in incomes could hit the financial sector, especially, shadow banks, disproportionately,” he said. “Moreover, the disruption to business for three months -- from mid-March to mid-June, might upend many business models in both the financial and non-financial sectors.”

1571,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 06:40PM ET</span>","Debt relief for poorest countries could extend beyond 2020, G7 says","By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Group of Seven finance ministers on Wednesday said a debt relief initiative for the world's poorest countries could be extended beyond the end of the year to help deal with economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
In a lengthy joint statement, the G7 finance ministers urged all official creditors to join the initiative, called for strengthened reporting of public debt data, and said all creditors - public and private - should make responsible lending decisions in line with debt sustainability guidelines.
In an apparent reference to practices reportedly used by China, a major creditor for low-income countries, the ministers of the world's most advanced economies also said creditors should fully disclose terms of public debt and limit use of confidentiality clauses, including for state-owned enterprises.
The statement followed a videoconference meeting of the ministers amid warnings that low-income and emerging market economies will need more than the International Monetary Fund's initial estimate of $2.5 trillion to weather the crisis.
A debt relief initiative offered by the Group of 20 major economies, which includes China, and the Paris Club of official creditors could provide about $12 billion in extra liquidity through the end of the year. But it has drawn applications from only half of 73 eligible countries so far, and private sector participation has been halting.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told the Washington Post in an online interview G7 officials had agreed to ""work relentlessly"" to ensure that all eligible countries could benefit from the debt relief plan.
Last month, Georgieva had told Reuters some countries were reluctant to seek debt relief under the G20 plan, out of concern it could harm their credit ratings.
On Wednesday, she said ""a small universe"" of emerging market countries may need to restructure their debt in the future, given the impact of the economic crisis and a sharp drop in revenues in commodity exporting countries.
World Bank President David Malpass last week warned that ""much more"" debt relief would be needed, urging all commercial creditors to ""participate on comparable terms and not exploit the debt relief of others.""
In their statement, the G7 ministers highlighted the importance of private sector financing for sustainable development. They also urged quick progress on creating a database for private-sector loans to low-income countries.
The ministerial meeting took place days after U.S. President Donald Trump called the G7 an ""outdated"" body and said he would invite Russia, Australia, India and South Korea to take part in a postponed leaders' summit in September.

Canada, France, Germany, the European Union and Britain have rejected Trump's suggestion to re-admit Russia, which was expelled after its 2014 annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine. Others such as Japan have not weighed in.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 05:40PM ET</span>",Democratic-led U.S. House panel opposes any U.S. trade deal with Brazil,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House Ways and Means Committee said on Wednesday it opposed the Trump administration's plan to expand economic ties with Brazil given its record on human rights and the environment under President Jair Bolsonaro.
Committee Chairman Richard Neal and his fellow Democrats on the panel told U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in a letter that Bolsonaro's government had shown a ""complete disregard for basic human rights."" 
""We strongly oppose pursuing any type of trade agreement with the Bolsonaro government in Brazil. Enhancing the U.S.-Brazilian economic relationship at this time would undermine the efforts of Brazilian human, labor, and environmental rights advocates to advance the rule of law and protect and preserve marginalized communities,"" they wrote.
U.S. and Brazilian trade officials agreed last month to accelerate talks aimed at concluding an agreement on trade rules and transparency this year, including trade facilitation and ""good regulatory practices.""
But Democrats on the committee said Bolsonaro's government could not credibly be prepared to assume new standards for worker rights and environmental protections established in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, given its own poor record on human rights and other key issues.
Representative Kevin Brady (NYSE:BRC), the ranking Republican on the committee, told reporters he was unaware of the letter.
Instead of pursuing a trade agreement with Brazil, the Democratic lawmakers said Lighthizer should step up enforcement of U.S. laws and raise concerns about Brazil's unfair trade practices with the Brazilian government.

U.S. President Donald Trump has developed a close relationship Bolsonaro, a right-wing former army captain. The White House last week said the United States had supplied Brazil with 2 million doses of hydroxychloroquine for use against the coronavirus, despite medical warnings about risks associated with the anti-malaria drug.

1573,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 04:45PM ET</span>","‘Recessionary Recovery’ To Extend Until 2022, CIBC’s Tal Says","(Bloomberg) -- The recession of 2020 is different from a 1930s-style depression because it has an “end game” and policy makers are merely buying time until a vaccine or treatment is developed, according to Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
It’s safe to assume there will be a second wave to the coronavirus in Canada, just as all other pandemics through history have occurred in more than one wave, Tal said Tuesday during a webinar hosted by Equifax (NYSE:EFX) Canada. He added this will create a “zigzag economy,” where governments will be quick to abandon some of their reopening policies as virus cases rise. Economic growth, though positive, will be volatile.
“The next few months will be great,” Tal said. “Activity will improve, confidence will improve, the curve will be flattened, the birds will be singing, the sun will be shining, and we will be cheating on social distancing.” The potential overlap of a second wave with the flu season later this year or early in 2021 could add to the fear and confusion, creating a negative impact on the economy and on productivity, he said.
The vast majority of job losses from the pandemic will be temporary -- “the name is still on the cubicle waiting for you” -- but there will still be long-lasting economic damage as some jobs and businesses disappear forever, Tal said. That will create a “recessionary recovery.”
“Only after we go through this recession can we definitely say it’s over,” Tal said. “That will be a 2022 story, I believe.”
A record federal deficit of about C$260 billion ($193 billion) is “just a down payment” on what will be required, Tal said. However, given the government is borrowing at very low interest rates and had a relatively strong fiscal position before the crisis, it may not need to make significant spending cuts. He calculates the deficit would have to reach C$400 billion before interest payments would rise significantly.
The government’s emergency response benefit, which gives people who have lost work about C$2,000 every four weeks, will likely be extended but also modified to gradually remove the disincentive to work, he said.

1574,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 04:18PM ET</span>",Japan’s Mammoth Spending Likely Requires Third Extra Budget,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s ramped-up support for its economy is likely to require a third extra budget to help plug a record hole between surging spending and sliding tax receipts.
Virus response measures, billed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as the world’s biggest, are set to widen the gap between Japan’s expenditure and tax revenue to a record of around 100 trillion yen ($922 billion) this year, according to finance ministry figures.
Some economists say the situation is even worse than set out by the government. They say tax revenue is likely to fall well below ministry projections, making another extra budget almost certain as Japan tries to keep a grip on the developed world’s largest public debt load.
Japan’s predicament illustrates how quickly government finances can come under strain when global policy makers loosen their fiscal spigots when tax income is tanking. It also shows the difficulty of keeping tax and spending projections in sync at times of crisis.
Japan Doubles Down to Deliver World’s ‘Biggest’ Stimulus Package
“The gap between spending and revenue is going to widen to levels never seen before. It’s going to be worse than the Lehman shock record,” said economist Yuichi Kodama at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute, referring to Japan’s budget shortfall during the global financial crisis. Another extra budget to help fill the gap is inevitable, he added.
Spending in the year to March 2021 is currently set to total 160.3 trillion yen, according to finance ministry figures for the general account following details of last week’s proposed extra budget. Tax revenue is forecast at 63.5 trillion yen.
But the figures are based on tax projections from December rendered obsolete by Covid-19. SMBC Nikko Securities economist Koya Miyamae sees tax income falling to 51.6 trillion yen.
Japan has already announced it will allow some tax payments to be postponed. Income and corporate tax revenues will also likely tumble as Japan sinks into a deep recession. Even after drawing on reserve funds and cutting some routine spending, additional bond issuance is likely to be needed to fill the growing shortfall.
Japan Needs More Stimulus After World’s ‘Biggest,’ Analysts Say
For now, cabinet members say the need to protect jobs and livelihoods is the first priority, emphasizing the scale of Japan’s response to support struggling companies and households. If another extra budget emerges, economists agree that it will also likely include more spending measures.
“Now is not the time to be talking about fiscal consolidation,” Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said last week. Abe’s overall coronavirus response package so far is worth around 42% of GDP, nearly double the scale of measures launched by the U.K. and Germany, and triple the U.S.’s response as of May 29, according to Japan’s finance ministry.
Economists say comparisons between the stimulus packages of countries around the world can be difficult due to the different kinds of measures included.
Still, while the starting point for habitual bond issuer Japan is very different from Germany’s, the problem of deteriorating national finances is going to affect all countries, Kodama said.
“Globally everyone is doing the same. It’s not just Japan that’s reeling in shock, it’s not just Japan whose finances are going to take a dive for the worse. If that was the case, the yen would have been sold off and there would have been capital flight,” he said.

The epidemic has upended traditional face-to-face working practices, with millions of employees at least temporarily based at home in businesses that have been able to make the switch to curb exposure to the potentially deadly virus.
The Conference Board report said 77% of respondents in the April 15-28 survey expect more employees to work from home more than three days a week, with information technology and financial services, already areas with the highest remote working rates, set to lead the way.
Tech giants such as Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) have said they would allow most employees to work remotely until the end of the year.
Less than one in 10 businesses polled said more than 20% of their full-time employees worked from home before the epidemic.
Businesses with at least 10% of their staff working from home before the epidemic were more likely to self-report productivity gains over the past several weeks, the survey also showed.
A widespread shift to more teleworking would likely reshape the fabric of cities. With fewer commuters, major transit systems would lose revenue, and spending on city center food services, retail and other services would drop.

Of the 152 HR executives in U.S.-based organizations surveyed, more than 60% of respondents were in the business and professional services, manufacturing and health care sectors.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - A level of 2.25% for Brazil's benchmark Selic interest rate is not ""written in stone,"" central bank economic policy director Fabio Kanczuk said on Wednesday, suggesting that policymakers may be prepared to cut rates more than they have previously indicated.
At a Brazilian-American Chamber of Commerce online event, Kanczuk also said the central bank could buy dollars on foreign exchanges if it feels markets have become too bullish and the Brazilian real's rally too aggressive.
The real has appreciated about 20% over the last month.
The central bank cut the Selic rate by 75 basis points to a new low of 3.0% in May and said it could repeat the dose this month. But it signaled this would be the end of the easing cycle.
But Kanczuk said that 2.25% ""is not written in stone, or something fixed that you cannot cross."" Rates are still ""far from the effective lower bound"" and the weak economy can be still stimulated via monetary policy rather than asset purchases, he added.
Brazil's economy is expected to shrink at a record annual pace of more than 6%, according to a Reuters poll of economists.
A wider output gap would call for a lower neutral rate of interest, but huge government borrowing to fund crisis-fighting expenditure would point to a higher rate. Balancing these two factors is policymakers' main task, he said.
Kanczuk said the Brazilian market rally has not altered the bank's policy outlook or framework. Financial stability remains a key consideration.
The central bank has spent billions of dollars in currency market intervention this year as the real plunged to near 6.00 per dollar in May. Kanczuk said foreign exchange interventions are only to ensure smooth market functioning and amounts are small.
The central bank has no target level for FX reserves and has only sold ""small amounts here and there to make markets work,"" Kanczuk said, adding that this tactic could also be used buying dollars.
""Maybe if markets are excessively optimistic, maybe we buy a little bit,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives plans to vote on a Democratic plan to boost infrastructure spending in early July that aims to fix crumbling roads and highways and reduce carbon pollution.
On Wednesday, Democrats, who control the House, introduced a $494 billion five-year surface transportation bill that would provide $319 billion to fix 47,000 structurally deficient bridges and make other repairs, $105 billion for mass transit and invest nearly $30 billion in passenger railroad Amtrak and rail infrastructure.
In January, Democratic lawmakers proposed $760 billion in total infrastructure spending over five years. Surface transportation is the largest component of the plan.
""For decades, Congress has repeatedly ignored the calls for an overhaul and instead simply poured money into short-term patches. The result? We’re still running our economy on an inefficient, 1950s-era system,"" House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio said.
Transportation Committee Republicans said both parties must work together to enact new spending and criticized the plan's ""outsized funding increases for urban areas."" 
In April 2019, President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders had agreed to spend $2 trillion on infrastructure, without hashing out a way to pay for it. Weeks later, Trump abruptly canceled a follow-up meeting after criticizing congressional investigations.
With a presidential election looming, many doubt Congress will be able to tackle infrastructure this year. Lawmakers face a Sept. 30 deadline to reauthorize surface transportation spending.
A Senate panel in July 2019 authorized $287 billion in government spending over five years on surface transportation, a 27% jump, but Congress has not agreed on how to pay for it.

Congress abandoned the practice of largely requiring road users to pay for road repairs and has not hiked the federal gas tax since 1993. Since 2008, Congress has transferred about $141 billion in general revenues to the Highway Trust Fund. To maintain existing spending levels, Congress will need to find $107 billion over five years, government auditors say.

1579,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 02:50PM ET</span>",Virus-hit U.S. state revenue could start slow recovery in third quarter: analysts,"By Karen Pierog
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. state tax revenue, which plunged due to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, could start to slowly recover this summer as long as the outbreak does not undergo a resurgence, analysts said. 
With no agreement in sight on additional federal aid, governors are scrambling to plug budget holes caused by a drop in personal income and sales taxes, the biggest revenue producers for states. 
""We definitely expect the second quarter (of 2020) to be the worst and that things will start to increase in the third quarter slowly,"" said Sarah Crane, a Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics economist. 
The bulk of stay-at-home orders that shuttered nonessential businesses and services occurred in April, resulting in soaring unemployment and depressed consumer spending. While states began easing those orders in May, sales tax collections largely reflect transactions from the previous month.
""June is going to be bad and starting with July, if the pandemic doesn't get any worse, then we will slowly see some improvement,"" said Lucy Dadayan, who tracks state tax revenue at the Urban Institute.
States are just starting to report May revenue versus collections in the same month in 2019. In Texas, sales taxes, the state's biggest revenue source, tumbled 13.2%, after falling 9.3% in April.
Retail sales tax revenue in Kansas was down 13.56% last month, following an 8.16% decline in April, while personal income taxes dropped 22.31%. Illinois' sales tax collections fell 23.1% in May after April's 19.6% decrease.
In April, sales taxes declined year-over-year in all but five of the 42 states for which the Urban Institute has data.
Personal income taxes were also down for almost all of the 41 states that collect them, although the decline was largely due to moving the April 15 tax filing deadline to July, according to Dadayan. 

Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies at the National Association of State Budget Officers, said even if losses in tax collections ease this summer, the overall revenue decline is expected to exceed the Great Recession's 2008-2010 drop of 11%.

1580,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 02:18PM ET</span>",Italy’s Conte Promises Europe Its Money Won’t Be Wasted,"(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte set out an ambitious strategy to rescue a paralyzed economy and win over European partners to help fund it, on the day Italians were allowed to travel freely for the first time in three months.
The premier told reporters that spending from grants and loans from the European Union under a 750-billion euro ($841 billion) recovery plan proposed by the bloc’s executive will test “the strength and credibility not just of the government but also of the Italian system.”
Conte, whose ruling coalition is plagued by constant infighting, charted a wide-ranging “new start” which stretched from more public and private investment to infrastructure including high-speed trains for the depressed South, a faster judicial system to attract foreign investors, and special tax status for poorer areas.
“We must be aware that the sum which is made available to us, that Europe will make available to Italy cannot be considered a treasure trove that the government currently in charge can spend freely,” Conte said. “This sum must be seen as a resource placed at the disposal of the whole country.”
Reform Package
The premier is battling to salvage an economy ravaged by bankruptcies and unemployment, with the risk of political and social tensions jeopardizing the stability of his coalition. Conte must also draw up a reform package to obtain support from the European Commission.
Italy’s economy shrank 5.3% in the first quarter, the most since the data series began in the mid-1990s. A deeper contraction is expected this quarter and the full-year slump is likely to exceed 10%, according to economists.
Conte stepped into a long-running dispute over whether to revoke concessions for toll-road operator Autostrade per l’Italia SpA, saying there was still every reason to do so. The issue is very complex, Conte added, saying that proposals for a negotiated solution are unsatisfactory so far and that the government will decide soon.
The premier reiterated an apology for delays in channeling aid including unemployment relief to economic sectors hit hardest by the lockdown. As Italy emerges from the containment measures, with schools still closed, Conte outlined priorities including broadband for all households, energy investments, and reducing bureaucracy.
“I appeal to all political forces to work on these projects,” Conte said, making a new call for opposition forces to join with the government on specific measures.
The government allowed Italians to travel freely between regions starting Wednesday, a move also aimed at helping the flagging tourism sector which accounts for about 13% of gross domestic product. Italy will now allow travelers from other EU states to enter without undergoing quarantines.
Conte’s appeal for unity will probably fall on deaf ears however. Opposition leaders, including Matteo Salvini of the anti-migrant League, have accused Conte of ignoring them during the virus emergency, and have rekindled protests across the country despite continuing social distancing rules.
Italy smashed demand records at a sale of government bonds earlier Wednesday, just a day before the European Central Bank decides whether to step up support for the region’s debt. The nation received orders of over 100 billion euros for its syndicated offering of 10-year debt.
Italy has to drastically ramp up bond sales in order to fund a growing fiscal deficit, with the country’s debt as a share of economic output set to top 150% this year.

""No option is off the table and we are looking very closely at air bridges ..,"" she added.
Tolhurst said the government's job support scheme ""was not designed for taxpayers to fund the wages of employees only for those companies to put the same staff on notice of redundancy during the furlough period.""
She singled out British Airways, saying it should ""pay a price"" for what she called a breach of faith after it put thousands of staff on notice of redundancy while the government was funding their salaries during COVID-19.
She said the airline, owned by IAG (LON:ICAG), had taken advantage of a government scheme intended to protect jobs and used it as ""a convenient funding stream for a long-planned corporate restructuring"".
Some lawmakers said the Civil Aviation Authority should review its landing slots as a way to put pressure on BA.
""I want to ensure the slot allocation process encourages competition and provides connectivity so this is something that I will be looking at,"" Tolhurst said.
BA's chief executive Alex Cruz said unions were campaigning to have Heathrow slots taken away from the airline. ""I don't need to tell you that every slot lost will lead to jobs in BA being permanently lost,"" he told staff in a letter seen by Reuters.
BA said in April it planned to axe up to 12,000 of its 42,000 employees.

1582,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 12:54PM ET</span>","Fed Flirting With Moral Hazard to Keep Markets Open, Dudley Says","(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve action to keep credit flowing rewards risky behavior and the remedy may be tougher regulation in the future, said former New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley.
“People who have high-yield debt that’s outstanding, a lot of times that’s happened by choice,” he told Bloomberg Television Wednesday in an interview with Tom Keene, Lisa Abramowicz and Jonathan Ferro (NYSE:FOE). “So for the Federal Reserve to intervene and support those asset prices, is basically creating a little bit of moral hazard in the sense you’re encouraging people to take on more debt.”
The Fed has unveiled a range of emergency lending programs since March to keep credit flowing during the coronavirus pandemic. Among them is a facility for the corporate debt market that includes some purchases of exchange-traded funds invested in high-yield bonds -- though Fed buying has so far been relatively light. In addition, the central bank has bought trillions of dollars of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to ensure market liquidity in a cornerstone of the global financial system.
‘Bailed Out’
“We had a number of players in these last few months that have essentially been bailed out by the Fed: Hedge funds that were invested in cash Treasuries, and short Treasury futures,” said Dudley, noting Fed Treasury purchases helped “those entities unwind what turned out to be a bad trade.”
“If people become very leveraged and they’re big enough to be systemic, then I think there needs to be some regulation to reel that in,” he said. Dudley stepped down from the New York Fed in 2018
His remarks come with the Fed in blackout ahead of its meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday. Officials are expected to hold interest rates near zero and re-commit to using their full range of tools to support the U.S. economy as it slowly reopens from the virus lockdown.
More than 40 million U.S. workers have filed for unemployment benefits in the past 2-1/2 months as businesses shuttered and Americans stayed home to limit the contagion. Payroll data due Friday is expected to show the unemployment rate surged to 19.5% in May, the highest level since the Great Depression.
The Fed has also sought to ease strain by loosening the regulatory reins on banks and encouraging them to show forbearance with borrowers struggling to keep up debt payments. Big banks have been more tightly regulated since the 2008 financial crisis. A range of other intermediaries -- often called shadow banks -- still operate under a light regulatory touch. Dudley said they may require stricter oversight and he had a couple of suggestions.
Liquidity Insurance
The Fed could instruct banks to limit the leverage they offer private equity and hedge-fund clients, or require the purchase of “liquidity insurance from the Fed during peacetime so it’s available during wartime,” he said.
As the scale of the pandemic and likely economic devastation became apparent, investors dashed for the safety of cash, causing a severe shortage of liquidity and prompting the Fed to step in.
“What the Fed really wants to avoid in these kinds of episodes is where people have to dump lots of assets into the market and there’s no buyers and that then distorts markets significantly,” Dudley said.
In addition, he said the Securities Exchange Commission could change mutual fund rules so that funds invested in very illiquid assets stop offering overnight liquidity. That would help prevent the risk of a “fire sale” of underlying assets to meet cash demands when investors all ask for their money back at the same time.
“There are a number of things that are worth exploring,” he said. “It’s one thing if you have a financial crisis every 50, 100 years. If you start to have a financial crisis every 10 years, then the Fed’s actions are going to encourage people to take more risk in the future.”

Domestic passenger traffic rose 30% globally in May from a very low base in April, when much of the industry was brought to a near-standstill by the COVID-19 pandemic, IATA said in an online presentation.
But the uptick came at the price of fare cuts that airlines can ill afford on top of extra health measures and other new coronavirus-related costs.
""Airlines need cash because of the crisis and they're seeking to encourage passengers into seats by offering low fares,"" IATA Chief Economist Brian Pearce said.
""The challenge (is) that unit costs will have been increased by a number of restrictions that have been put in place,"" Pearce said, predicting ""quite a difficult time for airlines"" as flights gradually resume.
In Europe, low-cost airlines including Wizz Air (L:WIZZ) and Ryanair (I:RYA) have said they expect to win business from full-service rivals in a discount-driven recovery.
Asian markets among the earliest hit are now improving steadily, IATA said - with Chinese, South Korean and Vietnamese domestic traffic back within 25% of year-earlier levels.
And in a sign that the recovery is taking hold elsewhere, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches for air travel have outstripped ""COVID-19"" queries since mid-May.

But bookings for the northern hemisphere summer that typically ramp up from March onwards showed only the beginnings of an improvement in May, the organization said.

1585,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 08:25AM ET</span>","COVID-19 will reset state's role in British economy, major investor says","By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic will reset the balance between private companies and the state in Britain and could in time produce a more productive economy, according to the man leading a 15 billion pound ($19 billion) drive to support smaller firms. 
Stephen Welton, head of Business Growth Fund (BGF), the most active investor in fast-growing British companies, is talking to the government, insurance companies, pension schemes and other investors to recapitalize businesses and prevent more permanent scarring. 
Central to any recovery, he believes, is the need to identify which companies can still grow in a post-COVID world. Unsustainable debt built up during this period then needs to be restructured and possibly turned into equity, before capital can be invested to drive future growth, according to Welton. 
Such an intervention across every sector and region of the British isles also provides the opportunity to direct support at the most productive companies, those with a greener footprint, those in the life sciences sector and those led by women, to address some faultlines in the UK.
""We don't want to end up with a series of businesses that are effectively just trading and living from month to month on a zombie-like basis,"" he told Reuters, adding that the right combination of public-private partnerships were now needed. 
""I don't think (the economy) is fundamentally going to turn in a different direction but is the balance going to change? Yes I think it will,"" he added in a telephone interview.
With COVID-19 upending the economy, the British government has paid the salaries of more than 10 million people, offered tax breaks worth 20 billion pounds and provided more than 30 billion pounds' worth of state guarantees for loans and grants. 
Any recapitalization will need to be launched before those schemes end, Welton said. BGF was established in the wake of the 2008 financial crash by major banks and has invested around 2.3 billion pounds as a long-term partner into restaurant chains, engineers, software and digital groups, generally outside London. 
With financial backing from  Barclays  (LON:BARC), HSBC, Lloyds (LON:LLOY), RBS (LON:RBS) and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), it made operating profit of 133 million pounds in 2019. 
Its support could in time double and Welton is now working to ""crowd in"" funds from private investors. 
""(This is) unprecedented, which is why we're going to have to come up with solutions that are unprecedented,"" he said. 
""If we wait for the government to come up with solutions in every single sector, I just think that is from a practical standpoint unrealistic and from a time standpoint too slow.""

Britain left the EU in January but is covered by a transition period that is due to end on Dec. 31. Talks on a future trading relationship between Britain and the EU entered a fourth round this week.
""It is fundamental to the Bank of England’s remit that it prepares the UK financial system for all risks that it might face,"" the BoE said in a statement.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey held a conference call on Tuesday with Britain's biggest banks in which he emphasized the need to step up their plans for a no-deal Brexit, Sky News reported earlier on Wednesday.
The BoE said it meets the leadership of UK banks on a very regular basis.
""As we have said previously, the possibility that negotiations between the UK and EU over a future trading relationship might not conclude in a deal is one of a number of outcomes that UK banks need to prepare for over the coming months,"" the BoE said.
 Barclays  (L:BARC) and RBS (L:RBS) declined to comment. HSBC (L:HSBA) and Lloyds (LON:LLOY)  were not immediately available for comment.
Britain wants binding commitments from the EU on financial market access to avoid the country's finance industry suddenly being cut off from the bloc, which is a major export market for British financial services.
But the EU has said that British banks, insurers and asset managers face the limited kind of access given by the bloc to the United States, Japan and Singapore.
Senior sources at two major banks told Reuters they had been preparing for a long time to cope with a no-deal Brexit from an operational perspective, after relocating UK-based staff and management to new offices in the EU.
Britain's financial services minister John Glen said on Wednesday that the country's financial services industry was ""world class"" and was ready for whatever Brexit outcome.
""I continue to believe that we are still well placed as a sector, whatever the specific outcomes are of negotiations ahead of us in the second half of this year,"" he said on a webinar.
Britain still expects to secure a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU, Glen said.
A senior EU official said last week that Britain's financial services sector should be ready for a no-deal Brexit.

1587,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>",German Bund yields at highest since mid-April as risk appetite soars,"By Dhara Ranasinghe and Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - Germany's benchmark 10-year Bund yield hit its highest level since mid-April on Wednesday as investors shed safe haven assets on encouraging economic data from China and optimism about the easing of lockdown restrictions around the world.
Italy's borrowing costs also rose, hitting a one-week high, as the country received over 100 billion euros of demand for a new 10-year government bond sale, suggesting the deal size could be quite high.
Demand for European government debt in general took a knock as world stocks vaulted to three-month highs after the Chinese services sector bounced back to growth and as lockdown restrictions were eased globally.
""It looks like the improvement in risk sentiment globally is weighing on safer assets,"" said ING senior rates strategist Antoine Bouvet.
Selling in bond markets was expected to be limited ahead of Thursday's ECB meeting, at which many economists expect the central bank to ramp up emergency bond purchases to bolster an economy ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic.
ECB data released on Tuesday showed the central bank scooped up all of Italy's new debt in April and May but only managed to keep borrowing costs from rising.
The ECB and the Bank of Italy bought 37.4 billion euros worth of Italian bonds under its emergency bond buying scheme, or 21.6% of the program's monthly total, the first breakdown of the figures showed. Italy's share of the scheme, based on the size of its economy and population, should be 17%.
""There is a clear willingness to tighten spreads by deviating from the capital key, which will help skew market reaction in favors of Italy and Spain if we are right in expecting a top-up of the PEPP (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme) tomorrow,"" Bouvet said.
Germany's benchmark 10-year German bond yields rose to -0.373% (DE10YT=RR) in early trade, their highest since mid-April, though they eased back to around -0.40% by 1200 GMT. Ten-year bond yields across the euro area were 2-4 bps higher on the day, while 30-year US Treasury yields hit their highest level since late March. (US30YT=RR)
Italy's 10-year bond yield rose 4.5 bps to 1.55% (IT10YT=RR) as the Treasury started marketing a new 10-year BTP bond via a pool of banks. At the last update, the country's debt management office was set to price the bonds at 9 bps over the outstanding August 2030 BTP.
Bond yields tend to rise during a debt sale as investors sell outstanding bonds to make space for the new supply.

1589,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 06:42AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday, June 3rd","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Global markets rally and the dollar eases as the wave of protests in the U.S. loses some intensity, and data point to the world economy bottoming out. ADP will report its hiring data for May, while oil prices hit a three-month high on hopes for an extension of OPEC-led output restraint. And teleconference company Zoom Video lives up to the hype with its quarterly results. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, June 3rd.
1. Markets rally, dollar eases on recovery hopes, quieter protests
Global markets rallied as some of the heat went out of the protests in the U.S., allowing investors to focus again on the pace of economic reopening.
By 6:30 AM ET, the Dow Jones 30 futures contract was up 0.7% and closing in on the 26,000 level for the first time since March, while the S&P 500 futures contract was up another 0.5% at just under 3,100. The Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.4%.
The appetite for risk was also visible in foreign exfchange markets, where the dollar index fell to its lowest in nearly three months, due largely to gains by the euro and sterling. Money is also flooding out of the dollar and into emerging currencies, with the Russian ruble, Indonesian rupiah, and Mexican and Chilean pesos all gaining more than 3% against it in the last week.
2. Surveys show economic improvement in May in China, Europe
Economic data from the developed world still looks grim, although higher-frequency releases continue to strengthen hopes that the economy has bottomed. That contributed to another blow-out 10-year government bond auction in Italy, which attracted 85 billion euros in bids.
European purchasing manager indices released earlier confirmed a modest bounce from April’s lows, although they remained deep in contraction territory.
China’s Caixin services PMI, however, returned to signalling growth, with an index reading of 55. At the same time, Australia’s economy – often seen as a rough proxy for Chinese demand --  confirmed it had fallen into recession for the first time in 30 years with a second straight contraction in the first quarter.
3. ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) to release private payrolls survey; factory orders data also due
Payrolls processor ADP will release its monthly report on hiring in the U.S. economy at 8:15 AM ET. Analysts expect the economy to have shed another 9 million jobs through the middle of May, after a disastrous April in which over 20 million jobs were lost.
The numbers come a day ahead of the more closely-watched weekly data for jobless claims, and the official government labor market report for May on Friday.
Before then, there will be weekly numbers for mortgage applications, and later in the day, there will also by the May ISM non-manufacturing survey and factory goods orders data for April.
4. Zoom lives up to the hype
 Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM), the teleconferencing company that has come to symbolize the structural changes being forced upon the economy by the Covid-19 virus, lived up to its hype with its first-quarter results after the bell on Wednesday.
The company reported revenue rose 169% from a year earlier, while net profit was $27 million, rather than the $2 million expected. Its top-tier premium customer numbers rose by 90%, while total paying customers rose four times.
The only fly in the ointment was a drop in the company’s gross margin due to higher costs for all the data it needs. Margins fell from 80% to just under 70%, still respectable by the standards of the times.
Zoom Video stock rose 0.2% in premarket trading, having risen some 25% in the last week to value the company at $59 billion.
5. London oil futures back at $40 on hopes for extended output cuts 
Crude oil prices hit their highest in three months as speculation strengthened that OPEC, Russia and other major exporters will extend their current deal on output restraint for another three months, rather than starting to taper it as originally envisaged. 
The current deal takes 9.7 million barrels a day in output off world markets, but that number was supposed to ease to 7.7 million at the end of the month through the end of the year.
Algeria, which holds OPEC’s rotating presidency, has proposed moving up a meeting planned for next week to this Thursday. However, newswire reports suggest opposition from Russia and others, due to suspicions that some signatories are already producing above their quotas.
U.S. crude prices rose 0.1% to $36.84 a barrel, while Brent Futures rose as high as $40.52 a barrel before falling back to trade at $39.39.
The U.S. releases official crude inventory data at 10:30 AM ET. The American Petroleum Institute’s data on Tuesday indicated a slight draw in stocks last week."
1590,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 06:18AM ET</span>",Trump-Xi Standoff Over Hong Kong Puts Trade Deal in Spotlight,"(Bloomberg) --
As China awaits U.S. sanctions for cracking down on Hong Kong, recent murmurs in the agriculture markets have increased worries that a trade deal between the world’s two biggest economies could unravel.
Chinese imports of U.S. farm goods are a cornerstone of the phase one trade deal inked in January after a lengthy tit-for-tat trade war. Over nearly two years of talks, Beijing was careful to separate trade from political disputes with the U.S. over issues including the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.
This week gave rise to questions of a shift: People familiar with the situation said that Chinese officials told state-run agricultural companies to pause purchases of some American farm goods, including soybeans, as Beijing evaluates a potential U.S. response over Hong Kong. There are some exceptions, one person said, and some transactions have still filtered through.
News reports of the order were likely a “trial balloon” as any halt would be a significant change in approach, said Jude Blanchette, Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. He added that he was “very skeptical” Beijing would meaningfully stop the purchases.
“It’s Beijing showing that they can act, not an action in itself,” he added. “The separation of political and economic statecraft could end if the U.S. pushed China to the point where restraint stopped looking like reasonable behavior, and starting looking like weakness.”
Retaliation Threats
China had agreed to buy U.S. farm goods worth about $36.5 billion for 2020 as part of the deal, one of the few tangible outcomes President Donald Trump has been able to tout after imposing punitive tariffs that drew retaliation, roiled both economies and upended global trade. However, the coronavirus outbreak and already weakening demand meant China only managed to import $3.35 billion in American agricultural products in the first three months of the year, the lowest for that period since 2007.
On top of that, bilateral relations have also deteriorated dramatically since the January signing. Fights are brewing across a range of issues, from responsibility for the virus and 5G networks to human rights in Xinjiang and territorial disputes in the South China Sea.
China has repeatedly threatened to retaliate against the U.S. for putting restrictions on its companies and citizens, though it has not specified what measures it will take. Beijing has up till now refrained from using economic coercion to hit back against the U.S., a strategy it has employed against other smaller countries who have raised its ire.
Last month, it banned shipments of meat from some Australian exporters and slapped tariffs of more than 80% on Australian barley after the country called for an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus. China also restricted canola imports from Canada following its 2018 detention of a Huawei Technologies Co. executive, who is currently fighting extradition to the U.S. In both cases, China cited legal and health violations and didn’t connect the restrictions to the disputes.
“China has the right to adopt trade measures to let its trade partners cool their heads,” said Mei Xinyu, a researcher at a think tank under China’s commerce ministry, repeating the government’s stance that the Trump administration’s moves against Hong Kong endanger China’s national sovereignty. ”You cannot talk business with someone who stabs your back.”
The Global Times, a Communist Party tabloid, ran a story on Monday citing Chinese experts who said a pause in agricultural imports could be preparation to retaliate against U.S. measures, and such a move would be “unsurprising.”
Political Climate
Still, officially China still says it’s committed to the deal: Premier Li Keqiang last month reiterated a pledge to implement the phase one agreement during high-profile annual legislative meetings in Beijing. But some Chinese analysts argued that was contingent on both sides maintaining political stability.
“The implementation of the phase-one deal requires a peaceful and stable atmosphere, yet the U.S. has been hurling new insults non-stop at China every a few days,” said He Weiwen, who previously served as a commercial attache at the Chinese consulates in New York and San Francisco. “China does not want to politicize the trade deal, but politics will definitely deal blows to the trade deal.”
Targeting agricultural imports would hurt American farmers, a key voter bloc for Trump as he heads toward an election in November. They have already received billions of dollars in aid that would cushion the impact of any restrictions.
And China currently faces a shortfall of at least 20 million tons of soybeans for the fourth quarter and first two months of 2021, the peak season for U.S. sales, because of lower supply from Brazil compared with last year. It may not be feasible for China to impose an extended halt of U.S. soybean imports given other major suppliers have restricted grain exports because of the pandemic.
Still, Trump faces fierce domestic criticism over his response to protests raging across multiple cities over racial discrimination and police brutality and is still struggling to contain the coronavirus that’s killed more than 100,000 people. In the current climate, U.S. officials could be pushed to take greater risks leading to further escalation, according to CSIS’s Blanchette.
“The U.S. faces simultaneous domestic and international crises,” he said. “We are in for a very worrying couple of months.”

1591,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 06:18AM ET</span>",Turkey Widens Clampdown to Hedge Fund Investors in Hard Currency,"(Bloomberg) --
Turkey will no longer allow investors to set up hedge funds that invest primarily in foreign-exchange assets and will start taxing existing ones, the latest measures designed to clamp down on local demand for hard currency.
The Capital Markets Board said it has suspended approvals for funds whose foreign exchange-denominated securities make up at least 80% of total holdings. The government will impose a 15% tax on the management of such funds, according a presidential decree.
At roughly $3 billion, the size of the funds affected by Wednesday’s measures is relatively small, especially when compared to the $195.7 billion of hard-currency deposits held by households and businesses. But moving to restrict this corner of the market shows authorities are determined to limit the persistent demand for foreign exchange, which threatens to weigh on the lira after it slumped to a record low last month.
The measures also come days after regulators hiked the tax on individual foreign-currency purchases. A string of earlier restrictions effectively banned local banks from trading the lira with foreign institutions by capping the amount they can lend offshore to just 0.5% of their equity.
Critics have argued that the country is edging toward some form of capital controls by limiting the exchange of the Turkish lira. The government has repeatedly denied having such motives.
That would be anathema to many investors after Turkey has maintained one of the most open capital accounts in the developing world. It still relies heavily on foreign inflows to roll over its obligations.
Inflation Hedge
For local savers, holding foreign currency is a way to hedge against the depreciation of the lira and deposit rates that don’t compensate them for inflation.
Data on Wednesday showed annual price gains unexpectedly accelerated to 11.4%, while the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists predicted little change from the previous month.
Turkey’s push for faster credit growth and cheaper money has pushed the average rate lenders offer for one-month lira deposits to 7.3%, the lowest level since 2013.

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 05:21AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Huawei hid business operation in Iran after Reuters reported links to CFO,"By Steve Stecklow and Babak Dehghanpisheh
LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies acted to cover up its relationship with a firm that had tried to sell prohibited U.S. computer gear to Iran, after Reuters in 2013 reported deep links between the firm and the telecom-equipment giant's chief financial officer, newly obtained internal Huawei documents show.
Huawei has long described the firm - Skycom Tech Co Ltd - as a separate local business partner in Iran. Now, documents obtained by Reuters show how the Chinese tech titan effectively controlled Skycom. The documents, reported here for the first time, are part of a trove of internal Huawei and Skycom Iran-related business records - including memos, letters and contractual agreements - that Reuters has reviewed.
One document described how Huawei scrambled in early 2013 to try to ""separate"" itself from Skycom out of concern over trade sanctions on Tehran. To that end, this and other documents show, Huawei took a series of actions - including changing the managers of Skycom, shutting down Skycom's Tehran office and forming another business in Iran to take over tens of millions of dollars worth of Skycom contracts.
The revelations in the new documents could buttress a high-profile criminal case being pursued by U.S. authorities against Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who is also the daughter of Huawei's founder. The United States has been trying to get Meng extradited from Canada, where she was arrested in December 2018. A Canadian judge last week allowed the case to continue, rejecting defense arguments that the U.S. charges against Meng do not constitute crimes in Canada.
A U.S. indictment alleges that Huawei and Meng participated in a fraudulent scheme to obtain prohibited U.S. goods and technology for Huawei's Iran-based business via Skycom, and move money out of Iran by deceiving a major bank. The indictment alleges that Skycom was an ""unofficial subsidiary"" of Huawei, not a local partner.
Huawei and Meng have denied the criminal charges, which include bank fraud, wire fraud and other allegations. Skycom, which was registered in Hong Kong and was dissolved in 2017, is also a defendant. At one point, Huawei was a shareholder in Skycom but, according to corporate filings, sold its stake more than a decade ago.
The newly obtained documents appear to undermine Huawei's claims that Skycom was just a business partner. They offer a behind-the-scenes look at some of what transpired at the two companies inside Iran seven years ago and how intertwined the companies were. The documents are variously written in English, Chinese and Farsi.
Huawei declined to comment for this story.
China's foreign ministry said the United States was politicizing economic and trade issues, which is not in the interest of Chinese or American firms. ""We urge the United States to immediately stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese firms including Huawei,"" it said. It referred specific questions about this story to Huawei.
'NORMAL BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP'
Reuters reported in March that Huawei had produced internal company records in 2010, including two packing lists, that showed it was directly involved in sending prohibited U.S. computer equipment to Iran. Huawei declined to comment on that story, citing ongoing legal proceedings.
(To read the March report, click https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-iran-sanctions-exclusive/exclusive-newly-obtained-documents-show-huawei-role-in-shipping-prohibited-u-s-gear-to-iran-idUSKBN20P1VA)
The newly obtained documents show that Huawei's efforts to obscure its relationship with Skycom began after Reuters reported in December 2012 that Skycom had offered to sell at least 1.3 million euros worth of embargoed Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to Iran's largest mobile-phone operator in late 2010. In January 2013, a second Reuters report described how Huawei had close financial ties and other links to Skycom, including the fact that Meng had served on Skycom's board of directors between February 2008 and April 2009.
(To read the December 2012 report, click https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-huawei-hp/exclusive-huawei-partner-offered-embargoed-hp-gear-to-iran-idUSBRE8BT0BF20121230)

In its response at the time to the Reuters reporting, Huawei said Skycom was one of its ""major local partners"" and that the relationship between Huawei and Skycom was ""a normal business partnership.""
But a newly obtained Huawei internal document from the Chinese company's Iran office, dated March 28, 2013, indicates Huawei controlled Skycom. The document in Chinese stated: ""In consideration of trade compliances, A2 representative office is trying to separate Skycom and Huawei."" A2 was Huawei's code for Iran, according to the U.S. indictment.
The document also noted that Huawei had installed one of its own employees to manage Skycom in Iran ""to urgently avoid the risks of media hype."" Huawei had made an ""urgent decision"" to appoint Hu Mei as Skycom's general manager in Iran, effective March 10, 2013, the document noted. Hu was a director of Skycom and was also listed as a Huawei employee in an internal Huawei directory.
The document detailed how Huawei quickly recognized a flaw in putting Hu in charge of Skycom. Hu was based at Huawei's headquarters in China, and the job required dealing with business matters on the ground in Iran, the document stated. So, Huawei decided to appoint instead ""a Chinese employee based in Iran"" to manage Skycom's Tehran office, the document shows.
Huawei decided to name Song Kai, deputy representative of its Iran office, to run Skycom in Iran. He was informed of the decision in an internal Huawei message that was reviewed by Reuters. ""Please update your resume,"" Song was instructed.
The message said that the change had been approved by a man named Lan Yun, who was identified as the ""chief representative"" of Huawei's Iran office.
Hu, Song and Lan couldn't be reached for comment.
POWERPOINT PRESENTATION
In response to the Reuters articles of 2012 and 2013, several Western banks questioned Huawei about its relationship with Skycom. They included HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) PLC, where both Huawei and Skycom held bank accounts.
HSBC declined to comment for this story.
In August 2013, Meng met with HSBC's deputy head of global banking for the Asia-Pacific region. She is accused in the U.S. indictment of making ""numerous misrepresentations regarding Huawei's ownership and control of Skycom.""
Meng gave a PowerPoint presentation during the meeting that said Skycom was merely ""a business partner of Huawei.""
The newly obtained documents show that Huawei soon became directly involved in shutting Skycom down.
In a letter dated Nov. 2, 2013, Song, the Huawei employee appointed to manage Skycom, told a major Iranian client that Skycom ""has decided to annul and terminate its business activities and dissolve the branch company in Iran."" Song's letter was addressed to a vice president of Iran's largest mobile-phone operator, Mobile Communication Co of Iran, or MCCI.
MCCI couldn't be reached for comment.
The next day, Skycom, MCCI and a new Huawei company - Huawei Technologies Service (Iranian) Co Ltd - signed an agreement. It stated that Skycom planned to transfer its contracts to the new Huawei entity. The agreement listed eight contracts worth a total of 44.6 million euros (about $50 million), with about 34.6 million euros remaining on them. Any money owed to Skycom was to be paid to the Huawei entity upon completion of the contracts.
""All the parties promise that this three-way contract remains confidential,"" it stated.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's three biggest banks have set up a study group that will look at possibly building a common settlement infrastructure for digital payments, an initiative backed by the central bank and the country's financial regulator.
The Japanese are most cash-loving population in the world and everyday transactions are usually completed in notes and coins. Authorities have been, however, keen to promote cashless transactions to increase productivity and more recently to reduce contact between people amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Unlike countries such as China where one or two digital payment systems dominate the market, Japan has a plethora of offerings competing against each other.
""Japan has numerous platforms for cashless settlement, but they have yet to overwhelm the usage of cash,"" Hiromi Yamaoka, a former central bank executive who will chair the group, said in an online briefing.
""One solution could be to enhance the inter-operability of digital currencies and infrastructure.""
The core banks of Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group Inc (T:8306), Mizuho Financial Group Inc (T:8411) and Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group Inc (T:8316) as well as East Japan Railway (T:9020) and several other non-financial firms will participate in the group.
Representatives from the Bank of Japan, the Ministry of Finance and the Financial Services Agency will attend as observers, said cryptocurrency exchange DeCurret, which will organise the study group. It will meet up to twice a month from June through September.
The three banks have each rolled out their own digital payment systems but lag efforts by tech firms such as SoftBank Group (T:9984) unit PayPay.
The study group may pave the way for the megabanks to link their systems to East Japan Railway's popular Suica smart transit card, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Wednesday.

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 03:00AM ET</span>",Column: Spend or hoard? Fate of forced savings could define pandemic recovery - Mike Dolan,"(The author is editor-at-large for finance and markets at Reuters News. Any views expressed here are his own)
By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - Many households have built up a stash of savings during the coronavirus lockdowns of the past three months -- and how they view them may dictate the speed of recovery from the pandemic.
Although the shock has caused spikes in unemployment, most households spent lockdown periods either working from home, furloughed or on direct government income support. And with few goods or services available to buy, their savings have soared.
Whether people see these unexpected cash hoards as a windfall or a buffer against future uncertainties is likely to determine the speed of the recovery, at least this year.
If the public treats the money like a tax rebate, spending could surge, says Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS's global wealth management arm. He points to U.S. tax rebates in 2001 and 2008, money from which was fully spent within about two quarters -- mostly on durable goods such as furniture and consumer electronics.
As lockdowns lift with no second wave of virus infections so far, pent-up spending could be a big boost to third-quarter consumption -- underlining why some investors still believe in a ""V-shaped"" recovery.
""This involuntary saving could be spent. It will depend on fear and trust,"" Donovan said. ""Fear of the virus and fear of unemployment need to be low. Trust in government policy needs to be relatively high.
""These are, after all, savings that many people never wanted in the first place -- at least as far as saving on entertainment and services is concerned.""
CASH STASH
U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data last week showed the personal savings rate almost trebled to a record 33%, or $6.15 trillion, in April -- having already doubled to more than $2 trillion in March. In the six months before, the average was nearly $1.3 trillion, or just under 8%.
Directly comparable data for Europe, which locked down earlier, is not yet available, but the European Commission is forecasting that household savings rates will nearly double to 20% this year. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) meanwhile points to a record jump of over 300 billion euros in euro zone private sector deposit inflows in March, although that will include firms building up cash to survive the freeze.
And on Tuesday, Bank of England data showed UK household deposits rose by 30 billion pounds over March and April compared to average monthly increases of 5 billion pounds in the six months prior. There was also record net repayment of consumer credit of 7.4 billion pounds in April alone.
Donovan notes that despite the large aggregate numbers, the distribution is scattered.
For many furloughed workers in Europe, for example, income has been at 80% of normal levels. But spending has probably declined by 20-30% across the major economies.
Some American households may even see a temporary rise in weekly incomes as they claim jobless benefits of $1,000 per week -- higher than half of all working wages. They also get a $1,200 one-off government payment.
It is higher income groups that tend to save more, however, as they spend a smaller share of their incomes on food and essentials. Much of that discretionary spending is on services such as travel, restaurants and entertainment that have largely been unavailable during the crisis.
POLICY TWISTS
While major uncertainties remain about the reopening of economies, job security, the trajectory of the virus and a potential vaccine, government and central bank policies will help determine whether this money leaves bank accounts as quickly as it arrived.
Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff argues that preventing cash hoarding is one reason why the U.S. Federal Reserve should consider adopting negative interest rates -- effectively a charge for not spending -- as European central banks have done.
Others fear zero and negative deposit rates just lead to a ""paradox of thrift"", where people put aside even more to make up for lost returns -- further swelling the savings glut.
For governments, the issue may also inform post-pandemic support. With private consumption the main driver of economic activity -- as high as 70% of GDP in the United States --  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economists say changes in savings patterns could easily offset any new fiscal measures.
They argue that fear of future tax rises to fix public finances could prompt household caution -- so-called ""Ricardian equivalence"", a phenomenon sketched by 19th century economist David Ricardo suggesting the public's behaviour in response to government saving or borrowing offsets the impact of policies.

What is clear is that current bloated savings levels mean confidence, or lack of it, could have a snowballing impact in the second half of 2020. Financial markets are already taking that on board.

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 02:30AM ET</span>",Argentina debt deal in sight as serial defaulter looks to avoid 'zombie land',"By Marc Jones, Tom Arnold and Adam Jourdan
LONDON/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina, in default since last month, is tantalizingly close to pulling off a $65 billion debt restructuring deal with creditors but still faces a complex set of hurdles to avoid falling into what one bondholder called debtor ""zombie land.""
The South American country's government is reworking a proposal to holders of its foreign debt as the two sides have inched closer to an agreement to revamp the debt. Creditors said they expect to have the new offer in coming days.
Striking a deal is key for the major grains producer to avoid years of legal battles and being locked out of global capital markets, which happened after a major default in 2001. Argentina defaulted for a ninth time in May.
""Unless there is an agreement in principle, Argentina would be walking into zombie land,"" one bondholder who requested anonymity told Reuters, saying the country needed to improve on its offer to win over enough creditors for a comprehensive deal.
Argentina's government has pushed a moving deadline for talks to June 12 and said it is looking to sweeten its offer, despite having only a ""slim margin"" to make any changes. In late May it unveiled an already improved proposal. (https://www.argentina.gob.ar/sites/default/files/argentina-pressrelease_28.5.pdf)
Major creditor groups have been lowering their demands too (https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eb2e6606e11e67a7b983448/t/5ed16c92ff1f544b3b0a7a32/1590783123179/Joint_Restructuring_Proposal_May-27-2020.pdf), cutting the gap between the two sides and raising hopes of a deal. Still, both sides say there is much work left to do.
Bondholders say Argentina can pay more than is currently on the table. Analysts say the latest government offer is worth between 40-45 cents on the dollar, while a joint proposal from two of the three major creditor groups is north of 50 cents.
""We remain of the view that a deal is likely to be achieved over the next several weeks,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note on Tuesday. It cautioned that the risk of no deal remained, however, saying the government was unlikely to significantly improve its terms.
MOOD MUSIC
The International Monetary Fund, a major backer of Argentina, on Monday supported the government's offer as being sustainable and said there was only limited room to improve it.
Argentina is set for a third straight year of recession with forecasts of an economic contraction around 6-7%, while emergency spending on the COVID-19 pandemic response is sapping government coffers and pumping up the country's deficit.
Citi said in a note that Argentina's government would likely use the IMF's backing as ""an argument to justify improving its offer less than what creditors seem to be asking for.""
Nonetheless, Argentine bonds have climbed steadily on growing expectations of a deal, rising over 20% on average in May. 
""The mood music has changed considerably from both sides recently,"" said one fund manager who has in recent weeks added significant amounts of exposure to Argentine bonds and is now overweight on the credit.
The fund manager, who asked not to be named, said the government was keen for a deal, especially given the impact of the coronavirus. President Alberto Fernandez is also seen as something of a moderating force in the talks.
""We're getting close and think there's quite a lot of potential upside, particularly as money flows back into emerging markets and Argentina will benefit as it's a high yield, liquid credit,"" he said.

""We think a deal will be done in the next week and a half. It seems that everyone wants to move on from this.""

HONG KONG/MUMBAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The spring started out rosy for the Indian arm of ClearScore, a company that offers online credit scores and loans.
Within weeks, the coronavirus pandemic had taken hold, drastically changing the picture for the online lending industry in Asia.
""In the second week of March, we were talking about what a great quarter it would be and a month later I had to let go of the team,"" said Hrushikesh Mehta, country manager for India at ClearScore. 
The UK-based company shuttered its India business on April 13, as 10 out of 14 lending partners withdrew their products within three days of the launch of a nationwide lockdown. 
Alternative lending companies and platforms across Asia are scrambling to raise funds and stave off bankruptcy as they face a wave of bad loans.
Sixteen lenders and investors in markets across Asia Pacific said companies were laying off staff and cutting costs to survive. 
Online lending had been one of the hottest sectors in recent years, as new players bet that a digital approach meant they could lend profitably to entities that banks found too costly or bothersome.
Asian online lenders raised more than $4 billion in 2017 and 2018, with Indian and Indonesian companies most prominent, according to data provider Tracxn. 
In India there are nearly 500 online lending start-ups, and roughly 160 in Indonesia, many backed by Chinese money. 
Some are peer-to-peer platforms (P2P), which match borrowers with individual lenders who hope to earn a higher return on savings; others use their own funds or partner with other institutions. Many combine all three approaches. 
But as economies across Asia went into lockdown to limit the spread of the new coronavirus, many borrowers defaulted. 
""I think it is only about 20 to 30% of (Indian online lenders) that are well capitalised, and the rest are going to struggle. 70% are staring at an existential crisis,"" one online lending chief executive said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. ""Since the lockdown started, demand is down by 90% and lending now is down by 95%"". 
Dima Djani, CEO of sharia-compliant Indonesian business P2P lender ALAMI, described the situation as ""natural selection"". 
""This is a test. Those come out unscathed will be the champions in a more saturated P2P landscape going forward,"" he said.
ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE 
The IMF expects Asia to record zero growth for the first time in 60 years, as lockdowns bring service sectors to a halt, exports plunge, and companies and individuals stop spending. 
Small and medium-sized enterprises and workers in the informal economy have been particularly hard hit. Asia-focused banks including, HSBC and DBS have taken greater provisions against bad loans, but alternative online lenders are worse off than their traditional competitors. 
Indonesian online lenders had an NPL ratio of 4.22% in March, according to data from financial regulator OJK, up from 3.65% in December, compared to 2.77% for traditional banks. 
""Most fintech companies provide smaller-sized loans for middle-low borrowers to fill the gap that banks could not reach. This cohort is unfortunately one of the most impacted by the pandemic,"" said Markus Rahardja, of BRI Ventures, the corporate venture arm of state-owned Bank Rakyat Indonesia.
It is also harder for some lenders to get repaid.
""Because everything from the paperwork to lending happens online, consumers find it easier to default,"" said Ashvin Parekh, a Mumbai-based independent financial consultant. 
Online lenders that fall outside the traditional bank regulations have fewer requirements in many markets about how much capital they must have on hand. That makes them more vulnerable to a wave of defaults, said Etelka Bogardi, a Hong Kong-based financial services regulatory partner at law firm Norton Rose Fullbright.
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST
Lenders must decide whether to lend more - there is demand from businesses and individuals desperate for cash - or hunker down. 
""If you have lots of money and you have reporting requirements, you might choose the approach of issuing more loans,"" said Jianggan Li of from Singapore-based venture outfit Momentum Works. ""But that's dangerous, the minute the loans are issued, people can't pay back on time.""
Abheek Anand, head of Southeast Asian investments at Sequoia Capital, told a DealStreet Asia event he had warned portfolio companies to be careful and avoid temptation.
More cash is necessary for either strategy. But venture capital funds invested just $388 million in online lenders in Asia in the year to May, a sharper decline than overall fintech investment. 

""The last thing I want to be getting into at the moment is online lending,"" said one China-based VC investor. ""It's just one turn of the glass and you go from being the good guy supporting microfinance, to backing loan sharks.""

1599,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 12:36AM ET</span>",New Bank of Canada Chief Takes Reins Under Mountain of Debt,"(Bloomberg) -- It would be hard for Tiff Macklem to imagine a worse economic backdrop to begin his seven-year term as Bank of Canada governor.
One quarter of the nation’s labor force is out of work after the coronavirus pandemic and an oil-price crash triggered the deepest recession in the postwar era. Tens of thousands of Canadian businesses will almost certainly close in the next several months, bringing lasting damage to an economy that was struggling even before the crisis, and is seen lagging the recovery in the U.S.
For Macklem, a career technocrat and most recently dean of the University of Toronto’s business school, that will mean testing the limits of debt accumulation in a country that -- with total government, corporate and household liabilities topping 300% of gross domestic product -- is already one of the most-highly leveraged in the world.
To counter the slowdown, the new governor, who replaces Stephen Poloz on Wednesday, will keep financial conditions as loose as they’ve ever been in the central bank’s nine-decade history. Economists expect the central bank to leave the benchmark interest rate near zero for the foreseeable future, starting with a decision at 10 a.m. in Ottawa, and to keep the economy awash in cash.
The Bank of Canada has expanded its balance sheet to about 20% of Canada’s GDP, up from about 5% pre-crisis, with the purchase of C$344 billion ($254 billion) of government bonds and other assets. It’s a situation fraught with risk, but many see Macklem as uniquely qualified to deal with it.
“He’s got great common sense, he’s whip smart, he can frame ideas very clearly and has rock-solid judgment,” said Jean-Francois Perrault, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, who worked with Macklem at the Bank of Canada and during his stint at the finance department in the financial crisis.
Macklem comes into the job with solid credentials as an economist, central banker, government official and business insider. He was a key architect of the global response to the financial crisis just over a decade ago, when he served as a top aide to then Finance Minister Jim Flaherty. Mark Carney, Bank of Canada governor during the crisis, recruited Macklem in 2010 as his second-in-command, a post he occupied until 2014 when he left to run the Rotman School of Management.
The new governor will need to draw on that breadth of experience to get to grips with the most pressing challenge: steering the economy out of its downturn while making sure the central bank doesn’t cede control of monetary policy as it finances the federal government’s massive emergency spending program.
“The most important thing is to at best maintain the central bank’s independence as far as that can be accomplished, and also not to be in the game of picking winners and losers,” David Rosenberg at Rosenberg Research & Associates Inc. said Tuesday on BNN Bloomberg.
An accomplished economist, Macklem worked his way up at the Bank of Canada through the 1990s before becoming chief of the research department in 2000. Former colleagues describe him as someone who shuns dogma and takes a pragmatic approach to policy, but who doesn’t stray far from conventional thinking.
For example, he advocated for a strong global fiscal response to the 2008-09 crisis, before quickly pivoting to support reining in deficits in the aftermath of that recession. He’s a staunch defender of the Bank of Canada’s 2% inflation target, but has shown a willingness to be flexible should the situation require it.
At some point, he’ll need to decide when renewed inflationary pressure or concern about elevated debt make it too difficult to justify cheap money. That may be made more difficult as the federal government becomes increasingly reliant on the lender of last resort to finance its deficits.
Canadian general government budgets will end 2020 at near 12% of GDP, from near balance before the crisis, according to the International Monetary Fund. No other major advanced economy tracked by the IMF will record a larger one-year fiscal swing.
This is where Macklem’s economics background may come in especially handy, as his “inner technocrat” helps him guide the Bank of Canada through the political minefield of government debt financing.
“He is of course a very analytical and evidence based guy and that’s just apparent in everything he did as dean and he’s going to bring that same outlook to the bank,” University of Toronto President Meric Gertler. “He’s going to be a fantastic steward of the Canadian economy.”

1600,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 12:27AM ET</span>",ECB Seen With Only One Choice Tomorrow to Avoid Market Backlash,"(Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank policy makers face the peculiar situation this week of being widely expected to announce more monetary stimulus well before they run out of the ammunition still to hand.
The ECB has so far spent less than a third of the 750 billion-euro ($840 billion) pandemic emergency purchase program that it started in March. At the current pace, it could wait until its July or September meeting before judging whether the program is big enough to soak up the debt issued by governments to fight the recession.
Similarly, the market stress that pushed the ECB into action has faded, partly because of the central bank’s bond buying, and partly because the European Union has moved closer to a common fiscal response through a 750 billion-euro recovery fund.
Yet anything less than a widely anticipated increase to the bond program could trigger a market shock reminiscent of the one in March when President Christine Lagarde inadvertently suggested that she might not act to calm peripheral bond markets.
“No increase in the pandemic emergency purchase program is basically a big jerk for the periphery,” said Pooja Kumra, senior European rates strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank.
An overwhelming majority in a Bloomberg survey conducted last week expect the Governing Council to top up the asset purchasing program by 500 billion euros.
The prospect that some central bankers might prefer to delay was raised in an article this week by newswire Market News International, which competes with Bloomberg News, saying “many members” of the Governing Council would oppose an increase.
Krishna Guha, head of central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said the article, based on unidentified sources, was “disturbing” and couldn’t be dismissed because “it would not be the first time that the ECB and Europe in general has stolen defeat from the jaws of victory.”
Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, reckons an increase in pandemic purchases will be announced but put only a 60% probability on that happening.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“The European Central Bank seems almost certain to increase the size of its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme at the next meeting on June 4. The present pace of buying, government financing needs and brewing trouble in Italy suggest it needs to be increased to over 1 trillion euros.”
-David Powell. Read his ECB PREVIEW
The ECB itself has built expectations for action. Policy makers have repeatedly said they’re ready to boost the program if needed, Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel said the decision would be tied to the economic data, and Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said “we will very probably need to go even further.”
Lagarde has already said the euro-area recession this year will likely be somewhere between the central bank’s medium and worst-case scenarios, signaling a contraction of around 10%. That’ll be backed up by new projections in her press conference on Thursday.
Moreover, the EU’s recovery fund, heralded as an historic breakthrough, still has to be agreed by all 27 member states and could yet be watered down. Even when it does come into effect, the funds won’t start being issued until next year.
“It would be rather stupid of them when they have forecasts and see where the downside risks are to suddenly decide to delay,” said Marchel Alexandrovich, an economist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF). “That would really be an own-goal after spending so much time and money on trying to support the economy and markets.”
Policy makers will be reminded that Europe is far from being back to normal by the fact that the meeting, and Lagarde’s press conference, will be virtual. Countries are easing their lockdowns while keeping many restrictions in place and repeatedly warning of a resurgence in the coronavirus if people don’t heed them.
“There is obviously a case to be made for them to wait,” said Piet Christiansen, an economist at Danske Bank. “You could argue let’s wait to see how economies open up before we commit to more. But it’s no time for heroes and waiting this out -- there are major risks and I don’t think the ECB can actually afford to delay.”

1601,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 12:25AM ET</span>","As Asia's tropical storm season arrives, grounded airplanes at risk of damage","By Jamie Freed and Ben Blanchard
SYDNEY/TAIPEI (Reuters) - Airlines, airports and insurers across Asia are bracing for the prospect of unusually high damage as the region's tropical storm season begins, as hundreds of aircraft grounded by the coronavirus pandemic can't be moved easily.
Major airports in storm-vulnerable regions such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand and India have been effectively turned into giant parking lots as COVID-19 travel restrictions choke demand.
""If you have got those aircraft on the ground, you can imagine to get them back up and running in a short space of time is no easy thing,"" said Gary Moran, head of Asia aviation at insurance broker Aon (NYSE:AON). ""The challenge is you can have a typhoon or hurricane coming and there are going to be a lot of aircraft that aren't going to be able to be moved in time.""
Airline insurers, already on the hook to refund large portions of crash risk premiums because of the groundings, now face the larger-than-usual risk posed by having lots of airplanes grouped together at airports, industry experts said.
""One event could create damage which costs millions to repair, maybe even closer to hundreds of millions depending on the aircraft that are involved,"" said James Jordan, a senior associate at law firm HFW's Asia aerospace and insurance practices.
In guidance to be issued to airport operators this week, seen by Reuters, the trade group Airports Council International (ACI) warns that flying the planes out of danger, the practice in normal times, may not be possible. It says extra precautions such as more tie-downs could be needed.
""Extreme weather events such as hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones are a seasonal hazard in many areas of the world, and in the COVID context provide an additional layer of hazard with many airports accommodating larger numbers of parked aircraft,"" ACI Director General Angela Gittens said in a statement to Reuters.
Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport has so many aircraft on the ground that is using a runway for parking, according to a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines. 
Taiwan's aviation regulator said it had asked airports to hold typhoon preparation meetings 36 hours in advance this year, rather than the usual 24 hours, to give airlines enough time to make parking requests. It will open up taxiways if needed at Taipei's main international airport, Taoyuan, to allow for 160 parked planes.
EVA Airways Corp said its plans included securing aircraft, parking them in hangars and sending some to other airports in Taiwan and abroad. Taiwan's largest carrier, China Airlines Ltd, said it had typhoon plans but declined to provide details.
Hong Kong International Airport, home to Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd and Hong Kong Airlines, said it had 150 planes parked and precautionary measures had already been carried out for most as part of typhoon season preparations. 
The measures include fuelling up the planes to make them heavier, tying weights to nose gear, adding weight in the cargo hold, putting double chocks on aircraft wheels and flying planes to other airports, the airport operator said.
Osaka's Kansai International Airport, whose runway flooded when Typhoon Jebi breached a seawall in 2018, said it had raised the wall's height and waterproofed facilities.
Airports will also need to ensure they do not have any loose equipment that poses a risk to airplanes or they could face claims from airline insurers, Aon's Moran said.

""The airport is supposed to maintain a safe environment for the aircraft,"" he said. ""That is their duty of care.""

The survey, to which 180 or 15% of Amcham members responded on June 1-2, showed 30% of respondents were ""moderately"" concerned and 53.3% were ""very concerned"" about the legislation, which aims to tackle secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference in Hong Kong.
The legislation, which could also see Chinese intelligence agencies set up bases in the city, has sent ripples through the legal, diplomatic and business communities amid concerns it could erode rights and freedoms in Hong Kong.
Beijing and local authorities have repeatedly said it would not affect the city's high degree of autonomy, agreed with its former colonial master Britain before it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997.
About 60% of the respondents thought the legislation would harm their business operations, citing concerns about ambiguity in scope and enforcement, erosion of autonomy, talent drain, Hong Kong's international status, social unrest and the independence of the justice system among others.
Some 30% of the respondents were considering moving capital, assets or business operations from Hong Kong.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is conducting a review of retail payments regulation in the country with a focus on the cost and resilience of electronic payments and access to cash.
Bullock said ATM withdrawals in April were down 30% from March and more than 40% from a year earlier as customers switched to contactless payments.
That has led to cost increases for some merchants when debit card payments are automatically routed through international schemes, Bullock said. 
""So far, the bank has not mandated that acquirers explicitly offer least-cost routing to all their merchants but it remains an option that will be considered in the review,"" she said in a speech titled Panic, Pandemic and Payment Preferences. 
The review would look at how transparency of the payment plans offered to merchants could be improved.
""Ultimately though, if market forces are not generating competition to lower the cost of debit card payments, we may need to consider lowering the benchmarks that serve as a cap on average interchange fees,"" Bullock said.
Bullock also said the reduced use of cash was making industry considerations of consolidating ATM networks ""more urgent.""

""I expect that there will be action on this issue more quickly now,"" she said.

1605,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 09:15PM ET</span>",South Korea announces $29 billion third stimulus budget to fight virus misery,"By Cynthia Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea unveiled on Wednesday a 35.3 trln won ($28.8 billion) supplementary budget, to raise the total stimulus to 270 trillion won for an economy facing its worst growth since the 1998 Asian financial crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Announcing South Korea's largest ever supplementary budget, and the third this year, the government has put in place support measures equivalent to about 14% of gross domestic product to counter the economic fallout from the coronavirus.
The latest budget aims to direct more spending on protecting jobs, development of a vaccine for COVID-19, and to provide discount coupons to boost consumption. More loans will be made to small- to medium-sized businesses hit by slumping sales.
Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said the government had to look past concerns about taking the debt-to-GDP level higher, which is projected to increase to 43.5% of the economy from just below 40% before the outbreak. 
""We're facing an economic crisis now, we had no choice but to do more on the fiscal front as fiscal policies are the last bulwark (of government policies),"" Hong told journalists in a news briefing days prior announcing the additional budget.
On Monday, South Korea reduced its economic growth forecast this year to 0.1% from 2.4%, predicting the worst performance since 1998.
In addition to the earlier increases in fiscal stimulus by the government, Bank of Korea has cut key interest rates  twice since March. 
The proposed supplementary budget will provide a fiscal injection of 23.9 trillion won, and cover an anticipated 11.4 trillion won shortfall in revenues due to the economic slowdown. 
Exports tumbled for the third straight month in May and the outlook for the trade-reliant economy is cast in doubt due to the global pandemic and simmering tensions between the United States and China.
To fund the budget, subject to parliamentary approval, South Korea will issue an additional 23.8 trillion won in government bonds, taking total treasury bond issuance for this year to 167.8 trillion won. 

The net increase in treasury bond issuance will be 108.5 trillion won, more than double of the amount last year.

1606,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",The PBOC Is Trying to Fix China’s Decades-Old Credit Conundrum,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s central bank is trying to fix one of the domestic economy’s most intractable problems: Poor access to credit by small companies.
Having resisted the kind of large-scale stimulus rolled out by its global peers, the People’s Bank of China (OTC:BACHY) instead has been tapping away at small-scale programs designed to improve the ability of small firms to survive the slump. On Monday it announced its latest plan, using 400 billion yuan ($56 billion) to turn unsecured loans to businesses into one-year cash for banks.
While a large infusion of money or bond-buying would cheer markets who’ve been disappointed by the modesty of Governor Yi Gang’s stimulus effort to date, it would likely only end up in the coffers of big state-owned banks or government-run companies. The small firms that make 80% of urban employment have traditionally been starved of bank credit due to lack of collateral or a credit record.
“Yi Gang has been inventing new tools since he’s been in office, rather than using straightforward interest rate cuts and reserve ratios cuts for easing,” said Zhou Xue, an economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd in Hong Kong. “It’s a process of trial and error. No one knows if the current approach can work, even the central bank, as it tweaks the policy while doing it.”
The credit support plan unveiled on Monday builds on top of an older policy tool known as the re-lending program, which provides cheap base money to the financial system with a condition that the money can only be used for loans to specific sectors. A refreshed version of the scheme has been increasingly relied on since banks’ risk appetite vanished during the course of the coronavirus outbreak.
“If the PBOC just uses aggregate monetary policy to supply liquidity, the money will be grabbed by privileged sectors such as large state firms and local financing platforms, while small and private companies still can’t get enough financial support,” said Zhang Xu, head of the fixed-income research at Everbright Securities Co. in Shanghai.
There are some signs that the strategy to date is working. Credit growth accelerated to 12% from a year earlier in April, significantly faster than the nominal expansion of the economy.
Economists have compared the PBOC’s new policy to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Main Street lending program, the European Central Bank’s TLTRO program, and even quantitative easing. Others have reacted warily, doubting whether such a small program can change much at a time when the economy is facing its worst performance since the 1970s and unemployment is soaring.
Effectiveness Doubts
Wary of the debt bomb and wasteful investment created by China’s last round of mega-stimulus after 2008, officials this time are being deliberately conservative.
Whether the relending program works depends not on the technical details of the scheme, but how the money is used by companies, according to Xing Zhaopeng, a markets economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Shanghai.
“Investment return in China’s economy isn’t very high at the moment,” he said. “It won’t be more effective in driving growth only because it’s an innovative tool.”
The government has said there is room to scale up stimulus if needed, though its remains unlikely that a massive asset-purchase or rate-cutting program will be unveiled.
“The PBOC is changing its playbook from old-style stimulus to a new one, but it hasn’t figured out a clear strategy yet,” said Liu Peiqian, a China economist at Natwest Markets in Singapore. “That’s why it’s stitching patches here and there, trying to close the loopholes while maintaining its overall stance of not flooding the economy.”

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 05:55PM ET</span>",Illinois to sell debt in first deal with Fed's muni liquidity facility,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois announced on Tuesday an agreement to tap a new Federal Reserve borrowing program, marking the first state or local government to access funding to address revenue shortfalls due to the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.
Facing high borrowing costs in the U.S. municipal market, Illinois, the lowest-rated U.S. state at a notch above junk, said it entered into an agreement to sell $1.2 billion of one-year general obligation certificates directly to the Fed's Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF).
The deal between Illinois and the MLF is expected to close on Friday. Sample purchase rates released by the New York Federal Reserve on Monday indicated a 3.83% one-year rate for issuers like Illinois that are rated BBB-minus and Baa3.
Illinois, which pays the largest yield penalty among states, had originally planned to sell the cash flow debt in the market in early May, but postponed a competitive offering citing market conditions.
Legislation passed by Illinois state lawmakers last month allows for the direct sale of debt to the MLF, as well as up to $5 billion in additional borrowing.
Besides Illinois, few governments have announced plans or have legislation pending to use the $500 billion MLF for loans of up to three years. Analysts have said the program, announced in April, was set up to be the lender of last resort and would make the most sense for lower-rated governments.

1608,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 05:27PM ET</span>",Negative Rate Benefits Seen Limited for Singapore’s Stock Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg on LINE messenger for all the business news and analysis you need.
While a decline in interest rates is generally seen as good for stocks, the benefits of Singapore’s slide toward negative territory are far from certain.
The city-state’s overnight borrowing rate slid to within two basis points of zero last month while the one-month swap-offer rate turned negative for the first time in almost nine years. The relative appeal of the nation’s $370 billion stock market boosted by the sub-zero rates is overshadowed by the negative implications for the economy and financial system.
Singapore’s gross domestic product is expected to shrink 4%-7% this year, its worst contraction since independence in 1965, as the pandemic pummels the trade-reliant economy. The plunge in money-market rates came as the Monetary Authority of Singapore promised to provide sufficient financial liquidity, while the government has deployed stimulus of S$92.9 billion ($66 billion) so far.
“Falling rates and sovereign yields mean that stocks would appear more attractive versus bonds,” said Eli Lee, head of investment strategy at Bank of Singapore Ltd., cautioning that context is key. But “as we have learned from Japan and Europe, ultra-low rates typically result from policy efforts to combat deflationary pressures and economic headwinds.”
While sub-zero rates have been a reality for years in Europe and Japan, the U.S. Federal Reserve has consistently opposed them, citing uncertain efficacy and potential damage to the financial system. Some Singapore investors are similarly concerned that steps taken elsewhere may not work for the tiny island nation.
“Negative interest rates would be very detrimental in Singapore given the country’s stock market has high exposure to financials,” said Nader Naeimi, the head of dynamic markets at AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney.
Naeimi believes that in Japan and Europe, negative rates have crimped bank margins, broken a key channel for the transmission of monetary policy and caused bearish phases in the stock market.
The dive below zero also has some silver lining. Singapore stock gauges contain many property stocks, especially real estate investment trusts, which “generally perform well in a low interest rate environment,” said Joel Ng, an analyst at KGI Securities (Singapore) Pte.
Singapore is starting to reopen its economy from a pandemic lockdown, even as it races to contain the outbreak among thousands of foreign workers. Containment will be the key issue for share prices, said Paul Sandhu, head of multi-asset quant solutions and client advisory for Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management.
The Straits Times Index is down about 20% this year and is trading near a record-low valuation of less than 0.9 times book value. Meanwhile, the $700 million SPDR Straits Times (SI:STTF) Index ETF is seeing record inflows as stimulus and cheap valuation embolden investors.

Adesina, who served as Nigeria's agriculture minister before taking the AfDB's top job in 2015, has been accused of abuse of office by a whistleblower at the bank including favouritism in hiring. 
Adesina, who denied the allegations, was later cleared of wrongdoing in an internal investigation.
But U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin signed a letter to the bank's board on May 22 rejecting the internal investigation. 
The United States, AfDB's second-largest shareholder after Nigeria, is demanding a new independent investigation, saying it has reservations about the integrity of the banks process.

Several former African heads of state and current presidents have signed a separate statement supporting Adesina.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is investigating digital services taxes being adopted or considered by Britain, Italy, Brazil and other countries, the U.S. Trade Representative's office said on Tuesday, a move that could lead to new punitive tariffs and heighten trade tensions.
Such taxes are seen by several countries as a way to raise revenue from the local operations of companies including Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB).
""President (Donald) Trump is concerned that many of our trading partners are adopting tax schemes designed to unfairly target our companies,"" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement. ""We are prepared to take all appropriate action to defend our businesses and workers against any such discrimination.""
The announcement came after the U.S. Commerce Department said it would investigate whether imports of the metal vanadium violate national security, a sign that the Trump administration is actively pursuing new trade barriers despite the coronavirus pandemic.
Trump based his nearly two-year trade war with China on a probe into Beijing's intellectual property and technology transfer practices under Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974, which authorizes action, including tariffs, to end foreign government practices that curb U.S. commerce.
Broad negotiations through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to set a global standard for digital taxes have proven elusive, and the coronavirus pandemic has slowed them down.
In a Federal Register notice, the USTR said the probe would cover digital services taxes adopted or under consideration by Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Italy, Spain, Turkey and Britain. The trade agency said it has requested consultations with these governments.
Spain's plans to tax tech companies' revenues do not discriminate against any country, a government source told Reuters.
The Internet Association industry trade group said the probe was needed since a growing number of countries had proposed or enacted digital taxes despite the OECD negotiations. 
""The U.S. must continue sending a strong message to trading partners that targeted discriminatory taxes against U.S. firms are not an appropriate solution,"" said the group's trade policy director Jordan Haas.

The USTR said the probe would look at whether the taxes discriminate against U.S. companies, are unfairly retroactive and ""possibly unreasonable"" in that they diverge from international norms.

The five-party centre-left coalition said it would channel the additional funds to investments in infrastructure, education and healthcare among other things.
Following the fourth addition, state net borrowing requirement will increase by 5.3 billion euros, amounting in total to 18.8 billion euros in 2020, it added.
""Year 2020's fourth additional budget proposal is part of the aftercare of the coronavirus epidemic, with which the government supports an economically, ecologically and socially sustainable recovery from the crisis,"" it said in a statement.
The government also said it would seek to stabilize Finland's debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of this decade, which the finance ministry estimated in April to stand at around 52% of the gross domestic product at the end of 2020.
The government said it would direct 320 million euros to child and youth wellbeing, including additional admissions to higher education and resources for schools to allow children to catch up after two months of remote learning and school closure earlier this spring.
""The transport network is a crucial factor for the success of Finland and its regions, as well as a prerequisite for new investments, finance minister Katri Kulmuni said.
Traffic investments will amount to about 450 million euros.
The amount includes 156 millions to infrastructure needed to enable Metsa Group's [FINPAP.UL] planned investment worth 1.5 billion euros to build a bioproduct mill in Kemi, northern Finland.
Kulmuni said the government would also fund the electrification of an old railway link that connects Finland and Sweden in the north, enabling rail access for passenger and cargo traffic from Finland via Sweden to the rest of Europe.

Republican Senator Chuck Grassley told reporters on a weekly call that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer shared that view following a call with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.

""A large airport with low volume, they should not need much more time for the passenger to come to the airport to keep the physical distancing,"" Angela Gittens, director general of Airports Council International (ACI), told reporters. 
""At a smaller airport or an airport that has peaking, I would say that it is going to be another hour or even two hours.""
A United Nations aviation agency-led task force has published guidance for airlines, airports and countries to achieve a uniform approach to flying safely during the coronavirus pandemic, although it stopped short of providing specific requirements for the hard hit industry’s recovery.
The guidance, which was adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) governing council on Monday, includes having travelers wear masks, and stand at least a meter apart at airports.
The guidelines, backed by industry, address the current hodgepodge of rules put in place during the coronavirus pandemic that make flying different in almost every country.
Aviation experts have said that a common set of safety practices will be instrumental in restoring passengers' confidence.

As the two sides launch a fourth round of virtual negotiations to try to secure a free trade deal and on their future relationship, fisheries looks set to dominate negotiations which run until Friday.
The talks, aimed at setting out a new future with Britain for the first time in more than 40 years outside the EU, have all but stalled, with both sides accusing each other of lacking the political will to spur them on before the December deadline.
But Barrie Deas, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, said although an agreement on fisheries was unlikely to be reached by the end of this month, it was a possibility for later in the year.
""I think a deal will be done. I think there is some way to go, that the two sides are very far apart but that's in the nature of things ... My feeling is that a deal will probably emerge in September or October,"" he told journalists.
""For me, the compromise lies in access in return for a new sharing arrangement.""
Last month, EU sources said the bloc was willing to shift its stance on fisheries which so far has sought to maintain the status quo - something that the British government said cannot happen now it is out of the bloc.
With both sides far apart not just on fisheries, but on the EU's demand for ""level playing field"" guarantees of fair competition and security cooperation, this week's talks are unlikely to break new ground towards a compromise. 
A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain would not be ""splitting the difference on the level playing field and fish: we aren't compromising on these because our position on these is fundamental to an independent country"".

Both sides want this week's talks to produce momentum before a ""high level meeting"", most likely when Johnson discusses progress made with EU chiefs, including Commission head Ursula von der Leyen.

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 09:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. small business program handed out virus aid to many borrowers twice,"By Michelle Price and Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A technical snafu in a U.S. government system caused many small businesses to receive loans twice or more under a federal aid program to help businesses hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly a dozen people with knowledge of the matter said.
The money mistakenly handed out could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars that the government and lenders - which made the loans - have been trying to identify and recover in recent weeks, one of the people briefed on the matter said.
The technical issue and scale of the resulting duplicate deposits made under the Small Business Administration's $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) have not been previously reported. They are the latest issue to emerge with the massive program, which was designed to keep businesses hurt by the novel coronavirus afloat and their workers employed. 
The error was caused by a blind spot in the SBA's loan processing system which failed to see when some borrowers submitted applications multiple times typically with several different lenders, three of the sources said. 
Information provided by the sources, which include industry executives and borrowers, as well as Reddit posts, suggest at least 1,020 duplicate deposits were issued. While that is a tiny fraction of funds disbursed under the huge program, it could amount to roughly $116 million dollars based on average loan sizes. 
A spokesman for the SBA declined to comment, while a spokesman for the Treasury, which jointly administers the program, did not respond to a request for comment. Launched in April, the PPP allows small businesses hurt by the pandemic to apply with a bank for a forgivable government-backed loan. The SBA has approved roughly 4.48 million loans averaging $114,000 in size for a total of $510 billion as of May 30. 
Under the program, lenders issue the loan and are later reimbursed by the SBA. The government has said it will only guarantee one loan per borrower, which means lenders, rather than the taxpayer, are likely to be on the hook for the error.
 Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL), Kabbage Inc,  Square Inc  (N:SQ) and BlueVine are among companies that have deposited duplicate loans, according to the sources and Reddit posts. 
""The SBA inadvertently issued duplicate loan approvals to some small businesses. It is our impression that the majority of these borrowers are...honest small business owners who had applied for a PPP loan through multiple lenders,"" a spokeswoman for BlueVine said in an email, adding ""multiple"" lenders were affected.
A spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase said the bank was aware of a ""handful"" of duplicate deposits and had referred those customers to the SBA. A spokeswoman for Square confirmed it was working with the SBA and borrowers to resolve the issue.
Spokesmen for Wells Fargo and Bank of America declined to comment. A spokesman for Kabbage did respond to requests for comment.
""We have seen a small number of duplicate applications funded through the SBA Paycheck Protection Program, despite the administration’s guidance that applicants not apply more than once for a loan,"" said a spokesman for PayPal, which partnered with a bank to fund the loans. He added PayPal was working with the SBA and borrowers to resolve the issue. 
CASH SCRAMBLE
The PPP was launched hurriedly on April 3 as the government rushed to get cash to millions of desperate borrowers. From the outset, the unprecedented first-come-first-served program struggled with technology and paperwork problems that led some businesses to miss out while some affluent firms got funds.
In the scramble for cash, many businesses applied with multiple lenders. Industry sources estimated that roughly 15-20% of the applications received by the biggest banks were duplicates. 
Most of those were spotted and withdrawn, but a fraction appeared to slip through if a borrower's Social Security Number and tax identification code were mixed up in the system, one of the people said. Another source briefed on the issue said the SBA estimated that the universe of duplicate approvals amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars if not more. 
""The SBA has asked lenders to review duplicate loans based on a list they provided and work with any other lenders that may have extended funds to get one of the parties to cancel,"" the BlueVine spokeswoman said.
The SBA has said in the past that it doesn't collect disbursal data from lenders, so the agency may not know the total amount of duplicate deposits. And lenders may not know if they have issued a duplicate deposit unless the borrower tells them, three of the people said. 
""How is it that I was successful at getting money from two different banks?"" asked one California-based business owner who said she received two deposits, one of which was processed by Wells Fargo. She told Reuters that she returned the other loan.
Businesses that refuse to return loans could be referred to the Department of Justice, which is probing suspected PPP fraud.

Some borrowers said they weren't clear on how to fix the issue. One Reddit user who last month said they received duplicate deposits from JPMorgan Chase and PayPal said they had a ""deep fear"" that if they reported the problem they may be left ""with no PPP at all.""

Investing.com -- Peaceful protests at the killing of an unarmed black man by police degenerate into riots and looting, while President Trump threatens governors with the imposition of martial law. China is going slow on its purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, while Germany is planning another big stimulus package - with its auto industry set to be one of the big beneficiaries. And oil prices are rising again as Russia and OPEC close in on an extension of their deal on output restraint. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, June 2nd.
1. U.S. cities hit by more violence
U.S. cities were rocked by another night of protests triggered by the killing of an unarmed black man by Minneapolis police.  Two separate autopsies conducted on George Floyd came to the conclusion of homicide, but offered different causes.  
The protests were marked on the one side by outbreaks of looting, and on the other by violence against both media and peaceful protestors as well as violent ones. President Donald Trump threatened in a call with state governors to send in combat troops if they failed to bring the situation in their states under control.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said New York would face another curfew tonight after widespread violence and looting in lower Manhattan overnight.  The protests threaten to derail the reopening of much of the U.S. economy, which analysts have repeatedly said depends heavily on consumer and business confidence rebounding.
2. China goes slow on farm goods purchases
Chinese government officials told major state-run agricultural companies to pause purchases of some U.S. farm goods including soybeans, Bloomberg reported, in a move that appears to undermine Beijing’s previous promises to increase purchases under the ‘Phase 1’ trade deal signed in January.
State-owned traders Cofco and Sinograin were ordered to suspend purchases while Chinese officials also told state-buyers to halt American cotton and corn imports, Bloomberg reported. It also noted that some pork purchases have been delayed.
The move is the latest development to reflect worsening relations between Beijing and Washington after the enactment of a new security law that the U.S. said ended the autonomy and freedoms of Hong Kong.
3. Stocks set to open higher, eye on reopenings
U.S. stock markets are poised to open higher, shrugging off the almost nationwide rioting and accompanying ballyhoo.
Markets are focusing more on the lifting of restrictions on the normal operation of businesses as efforts to mitigate the Covid-19 pandemic get a helping hand from the start of summer.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 futures contract was up 178 points, or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was up 0.6% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.6%.
One stock in focus later will be Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has cut prices for its iPhones in China in an attempt to revive flagging sales in the wake of the pandemic.
4. Germany pulls Europe higher with new stimulus package
The German stock market hit a three-month high, pulling European markets in its wake, amid reports that the government will debate a further stimulus package to the economy Tuesday.
Local media reports put the size of the package at between 80 and 100 billion euros (($89 to $111 billion), and said much of it will be aimed at the auto industry, which supports over 12% of the country’s jobs directly and indirectly.
Elsewhere in Europe, the EU and U.K. begin their last round of talks on trading relations after the current post-Brexit transitional phase lapses at the end of the year. The U.K. government has said it won’t seek an extension of the transition, which has kept conditions for businesses effectively  unchanged since the U.K. formally left the bloc earlier this year.
5. API oil inventories due as Russia, OPEC mull extension of output deal
Oil prices surged again on hopes that OPEC and Russia will extend their agreement on output restraint, which is due to lapse at the end of June.
The Russian government is scheduled to discuss the issue at a meeting Tuesday, according to local media reports, with at least one suggesting that Russia’s preference is for an extension of only one month.
In the U.S., the American Petroleum Institute will report its weekly data on U.S. inventories of crude and refined products at 4:30 PM ET as usual.
By 6:30 AM, U.S. crude futures were up 2.6% at $36.40 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 2.9% at $39.42."

The cost of the U.K.’s virus-support measures has risen to 56 billion pounds ($70 billion) as the government pays the wages of 8.7 million jobs, according to the latest figures from the Treasury.
Some 17.5 billion pounds had been claimed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme as of midnight on May 31. Under the program, the government pays 80% of an employee’s wage up to a maximum of 2,500 pounds a month.
The rising cost of the of support comes as the government weighs up the economic cost of maintaining its lockdown with the risk of a second peak in coronavirus cases if the country reopens businesses too quickly.

1621,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>","China Halts Some U.S. Farm Imports, Threatening Trade Deal","(Bloomberg) --
Chinese government officials told major state-run agricultural companies to pause purchases of some American farm goods including soybeans as Beijing evaluates the ongoing escalation of tensions with the U.S. over Hong Kong, according to people familiar with the situation.
State-owned traders Cofco and Sinograin were ordered to suspend purchases, according to one of the people, who asked not to be identified discussing a private matter. Chinese officials also told state-buyers to halt American cotton and corn imports, the person said.
Chinese buyers have also canceled an unspecified number of U.S. pork orders, one of the people said. Private companies haven’t been told to halt imports, according to one of the people.
The halt is the latest sign that the hard won phase-one trade deal between the world’s two biggest economies is in jeopardy. While Chinese Premier Li Keqiang last month reiterated a pledge to implement the agreement that was inked in January, tensions have continued to escalate since then amid a standoff over Beijing’s move to tighten its grip on Hong Kong.
“The market has already seen the deteriorating relationship between the China and the U.S. and many think that with the slow progress of Chinese commodity buying so far, the trade deal’s future was already in jeopardy,” said Michael McDougall, a managing director at Paragon Global Markets in New York.
Hong Kong
The measures to halt imports come after President Donald Trump on Friday lobbed a barrage of criticism at Beijing after it moved to impose controversial new national security legislation on Hong Kong. Critics say it will crack down on dissent and undermine the “one country, two systems” principle that has kept Hong Kong autonomous of the mainland since the 1997 handover from the British.
Cofco and Sinograin are China’s key importers of farm goods. They had been making pricing inquiries for 20 to 30 cargoes of U.S. soybeans on Friday but held off on going through with purchases after Trump indicated he would punish Chinese officials, one of the people said. Beijing is waiting to see what steps Trump takes before deciding its next move, one of the people said.
Still, American soybean exporters sold several cargoes to Chinese state-run buyers on Monday, according to people familiar with the transactions. Exceptions to the order from officials are made when state-buyers import on behalf of private firms who are not affected by the halt, when the state-buyers need the beans to cover their derivative positions, and if there are already ongoing transactions, a person said.
Nobody from the commerce ministry responded to a fax seeking comment. Officials from Sinograin and Cofco also didn’t respond to calls.
Trump’s Threats
Trump said the U.S. would begin the process of stripping some of Hong Kong’s privileged trade status, without detailing how many changes would take effect and how many exemptions would apply. He also promised sanctions against Chinese and Hong Kong officials “directly or indirectly involved” in eroding Hong Kong’s autonomy, though stopped short of giving specifics.
Equity investors had reacted positively to Trump’s remarks, as he didn’t provide any details or time-frame for what actions might come next. It’s unclear how soon the U.S. would move on a range of options, from sanctioning Chinese officials to imposing tariffs on Hong Kong to attacking the territory’s financial stability.
While Trump has periodically threatened to call off the “phase one” trade deal, his top economic advisers have suggested it would continue. Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC on Thursday that the trade agreement “does continue to go on for the moment and we may be making progress there.”
The two sides have traded blows over a range of issues from the coronavirus to Taiwan in recent weeks, and China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned during high-profile legislative meetings in Beijing that some in America were pushing relations to a “new Cold War,” and urged the U.S. to give up its “wishful thinking” of changing China.
China had agreed to buy U.S. farm goods worth about $36.5 billion for 2020 as part of the phase-one trade deal signed in January. However, the coronavirus outbreak roiled those plans, with China only managing to import $3.35 billion in American agricultural products in the first three months of the year, the lowest for that period since 2007, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Still, as China started to gradually reopen its economy from the virus-led lockdown, it had increased its pace of imports, including a more-than 1-million ton cargo of American soybeans in just two weeks in May, and rare purchases of U.S. soybean oil and ethanol.
But then tensions between the U.S. and China began escalating, with Trump blaming the Asian nation for misleading the world about the scale and risk of the coronavirus outbreak. The fallout filtered through to the commodities markets, with China opting to buy Brazilian soy instead of American beans.

1623,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 04:41AM ET</span>","French economy will contract 11% in 2020, more hard days ahead: minister","PARIS (Reuters) - The French economy is set to contract 11% this year due to the coronavirus crisis and more hard days lie ahead until things bounce back next year, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Tuesday.
France imposed one of the Europe's strictest lockdowns in mid-March and only began removing restrictions on May 11. Cafes, bars and restaurants were only allowed to reopen for regular business on Tuesday.
""We were hard hit by the virus, we took effective measures to protect French people's health but the economy practically ground to a halt for three months,"" Le Maire told RTL radio.
""We're going to pay for it with growth,"" he said, adding that a budget update being prepared would forecast a contraction of 11% versus one of 8% forecast previously.
With some 300,000 cafes, bars and restaurants reopening on Tuesday, Le Maire said that they would continue to benefit from handouts from a government solidarity fund until the end of the year to help cover fixed costs.
""Even if it is hard to hear on a day when the sun is shining and the cafes are reopening, the hardest part is still ahead of us in social and economic terms,"" Le Maire said.
The government is trying to avert a string of retail bankruptcies by seeking buyers for big clothing chains Camaieu, Conforama and La Halle, which employ thousands of people, Le Maire said.

Le Maire has already announced sector-specific support plans for the tourism ad car industries this month. He said measures for the aerospace industry were being prepared for next week and the start-up and building sectors would follow afterwards.

1624,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>",South Korea to resume WTO complaint over Japan's export curbs after talks stall,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Tuesday it would recommence proceedings against Japan at the World Trade Organization over export controls on some high-tech materials, adding that talks to resolve the dispute had so far failed to make progress.
Seoul plans, however, to continue dialogue with Tokyo which it accuses of not showing sufficient commitment to resolving problems, while proceeding with the WTO complaint.
""Our government has reached the conclusion that it is difficult to see this situation progressing through normal dialogue, which had been the condition for us suspending procedures to settle this through the WTO,"" South Korea's deputy minister for trade & investment, Na Seung-sik, told reporters.
""Through the WTO complaint, we will prove the illegality and unfairness of Japan's export controls and raise international awareness,"" he added.
Bilateral relations deteriorated after South Korea's Supreme Court in 2018 ordered two Japanese companies to compensate wartime workers in a ruling that Tokyo said violated international law. Japan says the issue of compensation was settled under a 1965 treaty.
Following the ruling, the Japanese government said in July last year it would stop preferential treatment for shipments to South Korea of three materials whose production it dominates and which are used by firms such as Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd.
Curbs on two of the materials - hydrogen fluoride, used as an etching gas in the chipmaking process and fluorinated polyimides, used in smartphone displays - remain in place and exporters need to gain permission for each shipment, which takes around 90 days.
A Japan trade ministry official said Tokyo will decide on its next course of action after seeing details of South Korea's announcement. 

Although the curbs have led to a sense of crisis within Korea Inc about its dependence on some Japanese goods, South Korea has not seen major disruptions to imports of those materials due to the efforts of South Korean firms, Na said without elaborating.

1625,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 03:00AM ET</span>",Taiwan says planned stimulus coupons could boost consumer spending by $3 billion,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan said on Tuesday that planned ""stimulus coupons"" for its coronavirus-hit economy could boost consumer spending by T$100 billion ($3.3 billion) this year.
In its latest move to spur the trade-reliant economy, Taiwan's cabinet announced a budget of nearly T$50 billion for the coupons, part of a stimulus package worth T$1.05 trillion.
Citizens will have to pay T$1,000 to the government to get T$3,000 worth of cash-equivalent coupons, the economic ministry said. 
The coupons can only be used until the end of this year and can be spent in most shops, but there are some exceptions, including tobacco purchases.
""We will not be giving out cash directly. If people get cash, they might just put it in their pockets without spending,"" Premier Su Tseng-chang told reporters. 
Lower-income families will be given T$1,000 in cash along with the coupons, he said, adding that the programme would start in mid-July. 
The island's main opposition party, the Kuomintang, questioned the effectiveness of the programme, saying it was ""inconvenient"" for people to spend money before they receive the coupons. The party urged government to give out cash instead.
Taiwan's economy, a key part of the global technology supply chain, is likely to grow 1.67% this year, as the pandemic hits the island's consumption, especially the services sector and tourism.
Unemployment also hit a more than six-year high in April.
The impact, however, was partly offset by still-strong global demand for electronics thanks to the growing need for telecommuting as more people work from home to reduce the risk of infections.

1626,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 02:05AM ET</span>",Gulf countries to experience worst economic crisis in history: IIF,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations are facing their worst economic crisis in history amid the double shock of plunging oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) said.
Overall real gross domestic product (GDP) will contract 4.4% this year, despite some indications that the virus spread has been successfully contained and the easing of some restrictions in recent weeks, said the IIF, a global financial industry body.
Cuts in public spending adopted by regional authorities to contain the widening of their deficits ""could more than offset losses stemming from reduced oil exports"" but aggregate deficits are still expected to widen to 10.3% of GDP this year from 2.5% in 2019.
The Saudi central bank said yesterday it would inject an additional $13.3 billion into the local banking system to help banks support the private sector, after consumer spending fell sharply in April due to virus containment measures.
For the IIF, the regional banking system remained solid, with strong liquidity and capitalisation, and relatively low non-performing loans. Liquidity support measures introduced by GCC authorities to support banks amount to 4% of GDP, or $54 billion, the IIF said.
Saudi Arabia, the region's largest economy, could see its real GDP shrink 4% this year and its deficit widen to 13%.
Oman, which is emerging as ""an increasingly vulnerable spot in the region in light of its mounting debt"" could experience a 5.3% economic contraction while its deficit could widen to 16.1% this year from 9.4% in 2019, the IIF said.

1627,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 02:00AM ET</span>",Australia central bank pins hope on quicker economic recovery after pandemic shutdown,"By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank held rates at all-time lows on Tuesday and sounded less gloomy as the economy gradually re-opens during what is likely to be the worst quarter since the Great Depression.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) left rates at 0.25% at its monthly policy meeting in a widely expected decision, and said the ""accommodative approach will be maintained as long as it is required."" 
In a short post-meeting statement Governor Philip Lowe said the RBA was prepared to scale up government bond purchases if needed to ensure three-year yields held around 25 basis points. (AU3YT=RR)
Australia's A$2 trillion ($1.4 trillion) economy is experiencing its biggest contraction since the 1930s in the current quarter but ""it is possible that the depth of the downturn will be less than earlier expected,"" Lowe added.
A significant decline in new infections, earlier-than-expected easing of restrictions and signs that hours worked stabilised in early May auger well for a recovery.
""There has also been a pick-up in some forms of consumer spending,"" Lowe added.
States and territories across Australia have been easing social distancing regulations at differing paces in recent weeks, slowly ending a partial lockdown ordered in March, having largely contained the COVID-19 pandemic.
Australia, which has about 7,200 coronavirus cases, has not reported a death from the disease for more than a week. 
The country's success in containing the virus has sent the Aussie dollar  soaring to five-month highs. Yet, that is leaning against monetary stimulus and won't be welcome by the RBA.
The central bank made no mention of the exchange rate in the statement.
Highlighting the depth of the pandemic-driven global economic downturn and the fallout on Australia, many economists expect interest rates to remain at record lows for at least two more years. 
Some are even predicting negative interest rates, though Lowe has ruled it out.
""While we have also become more optimistic about the outlook for the economy in recent weeks, we still expect the unemployment rate to jump to nearly 9% by Q3,"" said Capital Economics analyst Marcel Thieliant.
He expects the central bank to announce an expansion of its government bond buying programme at its August policy meeting.
""And we only expect the unemployment rate to fall below 7% by 2022. That would leave it far above the RBA’s estimate of the natural rate of 4.5%, underlining that the RBA will miss its full employment mandate for years to come.""
Q1 GDP MAY DODGE CONTRACTION
Official data out earlier showed Australia boasted a record current account surplus last quarter as firm export prices and a fall in imports provided a timely boost to growth.
Other data out on Tuesday showed government spending also added to growth in the March quarter, while companies reported better sales and profits than many expected.
The figures led analysts to upgrade their forecast for first-quarter gross domestic product due Wednesday with some saying the economy might not have shrunk in the quarter as previously feared.
GDP had been forecast to show output contracted 0.3%, the first fall since early 2011.
""A small positive print cannot be ruled out,"" said Su-Lin Ong, chief economist at RBC Capital Markets. 

""But the likely collapse in activity in the current quarter and accompanying impact on the labour market...is a sharp and deep shock through the whole economy with likely lasting ramifications.""

1629,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>",‘No-Deal’ Brexit Threat Looms Over Pandemic-Ravaged U.K. Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- The threat of a no-deal Brexit is back -- and with it the risk that the U.K. economy’s shaky recovery from the coronavirus pandemic will be hobbled.
As British and European Union negotiators head into the last round of talks scheduled before a key summit this month, chances are growing that the U.K. will end the post-Brexit transition period on Dec. 31 without a free trade agreement in place -- spelling turmoil for businesses.
Instead of postponing its final parting with the bloc because of the coronavirus, the U.K. government has so far ruled out any delay. That may be, critics say, because Brexiters calculate the cost of leaving without a deal will be obscured by the far more extensive damage wreaked by the virus.
To Sanjay Raja, an economist at Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB), a no-deal Brexit would halve the pace of growth next year to 1.5%. The U.K. in a Changing Europe, a research group, estimates gross domestic product could be crimped by 8% over 10 years as trade barriers and a reduction in productivity hit output.
“It may be less politically costly for the U.K. to do no deal in the midst of a pandemic, but economically I’m not sure about that at all,” said Jonathan Springford, deputy director of the Centre for European Reform. “It might be that they’re able to get away with it -- but I don’t think it changes the view that no deal would impose quite sizable economic costs.”
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). says the size of the shock could even force the Bank of England to take the controversial move of cutting interest rates below zero because fiscal policy and other tools may not be enough.
No-Deal Brexit Could Lead to Negative BOE Rates, Citigroup Says
Companies now have to think of how to prepare for Brexit while dealing with the fallout from coronavirus. Many are shuttered, indebted and struggling to pull through the lockdown.
The additional debt firms are carrying will make adjusting to Brexit more difficult, according to Alan Winters, director of the U.K. Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex.
The re-introduction of trade barriers with the EU and changes to trading relationships with other countries will require a major re-orientation of exports, he wrote late in May. Heavily indebted firms are less likely to invest in developing new export markets.
“It’s a tense conversation at the moment,” said Allie Renison, head of Europe and trade policy at the Institute of Directors. “Companies are struggling with their survival, and there’s not a narrative yet from government saying to prepare, but they are saying the transition is ending.”
While both the U.K. and the EU insist a deal is still their preferred outcome, the deadlocked talks and the limited time left available mean risk no agreement will be reached is rising: analysts at Eurasia Group now put the odds of that outcome at 55%. EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan told RTE last month that the U.K. “can effectively blame Covid for everything.”
If the sides can’t strike a deal by the year-end, the U.K. will default to trading with the bloc on terms set by the World Trade Organization. That means British manufacturers of goods such as cars, pharmaceuticals, plastics, and precision tools could face new costs and significant disruptions to their just-in-time supply chains in Europe.
For Patrick Minford, chair of the pro-Brexit group Economists for Free Trade, leaving on anything but WTO terms would mean Britain would “lose the gains of free trade with the rest of the world.” It’s also better that the U.K. stays out of the EU’s expensive coronavirus recovery plan, he said. “When you add them both up, it’s pretty serious, really, and we’re much better off leaving.”
The fracturing of supply chains due to the coronavirus is one wake-up call to the upheaval that could be on the way. More than 80% of small and medium-sized manufacturers say the pandemic has affected their supply chains, and while some say contingency plans for Brexit have proved useful in preparing for the situation, others are facing shortages.
The pandemic has also led to discussion of bringing supply chains closer to home, particularly as the U.K. struggled to fly in emergency supplies while factories were closed and most workers stayed away.
U.K. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove last week touted the “phenomenon of re-shoring” and said “we’re seeing how countries can increase resilience.”
But moves to shorten supply chains further could likely lead to goods becoming more expensive, according to Springford of Centre for European Reform. What is more, the U.K.’s geographical proximity to the EU means it’s likely to stay an important trade partner.
Philip Hammond, a former U.K. finance minister who campaigned to stay in the bloc, said last week that the government should at least seek a temporary trade deal to protect jobs.
Since the U.K. is such an open economy, “we will be more exposed than most developed economies to any headwinds in international trade during the recovery,” he said. “We really can’t afford to layer on top of that, during a very difficult recovery period, a sort of self-inflicted shock.”

1631,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 10:26PM ET</span>","Argentina extends deadline of debt negotiations, may sweeten offer","By Hugh Bronstein and Rodrigo Campos
BUENOS AIRES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Argentina extended the deadline to negotiate with its creditors to June 12 and may sweeten its most recent restructuring offer, the country said on Monday, after a previous proposal was deemed insufficient by some investors.
The government is assessing ""additional adjustments"" to its offer ""with a view to maximizing investor support without compromising its debt sustainability goals,"" it said in a statement.
""We are working on the final amendments to the offer but the margin that remains for adjustment is thin,"" Economy Minister Martin Guzman said separately, adding that the deadline would be extended again after the offer is amended in order to provide time to ink a final deal.
The government is looking to revamp about $65 billion in bonds rendered unsustainable by a long recession and a currency plunge. Argentina is already in default after having missed an interest payment extension on May 22.
The current offer received backing from the International Monetary Fund, which said on Monday it would set the country on a sustainable debt management path and that Argentina had little room to improve it.
""There is only limited scope to increase payments to private creditors and still meet the debt and debt service thresholds,"" an IMF statement said.
Failure to reach a comprehensive deal after a 2001 default led to a crisis that tossed millions of middle class Argentines into poverty and prompted years of haggling with bondholders in U.S. courts, The government wants to avoid such consequences as the country's economy gets smashed by the coronavirus pandemic.
""The task is with the government"" to get the sides closer, a creditor group that includes BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) among its members said in a statement.
""Bondholders have shown a lot of flexibility in making a sustainable offer to Argentina,"" said Dennis Hranitzky, legal adviser for another creditor group which holds debt that was already restructured in connection to Argentina's 2001 default.
""It is up to Argentina to show a serious desire to bridge the remaining gap,"" he said in a statement, adding that ""the IMF appears to be trying to facilitate a deal.""
MORE FLEXIBILITY, GDP WARRANTS
Over the counter Argentina bonds were up 1% on Monday following a 3.5% rise on Friday and steady gains through last month. Creditors are asking for a deal that would provide more than 50 cents on the dollar and the government was offering about 45.
Economists said the government could potentially negotiate down to 50 cents on the dollar, with the remaining gap in bargaining positions bridged by an offer of warrants that would tie the performance of new bonds issued in the restructuring to the future performance of the economy.
""There are some bondholders who want this kind of instrument, so it would help. But the government needs to offer more cash in the first years,"" said Gabriel Zelpo, director of Buenos Aires economic consultancy Seido.
Holders of default insurance for Argentine bonds moved closer to collecting payouts on Monday when the Americas Credit Determinations Committee said a 'failure to pay' credit event occurred when the government missed an interest payment of $503 million on May 22, after the expiry of a 30-day grace period.
The bonds in the current restructuring talks include a collective action clause (CAC), which means the government needs to meet a threshold of 75% to 85% investor support - depending on the individual bonds in question - to move ahead with comprehensive restructuring. 

None of the three creditor groups currently in talks with the government holds enough to trigger the CACs, but together they do have the ability to block a deal.

CIUDAD JUAREZ (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of workers lined up before dawn to return to work at automotive factories along Mexico's northern border on Monday, the first day that industries joined the country's list of essential activities beginning to reopen. 
At car parts company Flex Ltd (O:FLEX), staffers checked the temperatures of several hundred workers, allowing them one by one to enter its Ciudad Juarez plant that supplies  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (MI:FCHA).
A banner declared: ""Welcome! We've been working during this quarantine to give you a safe and clean plant.""
Ciudad Juarez Mayor Armando Cabada estimated that 30% of the city's factory workforce of 300,000 people had returned to their posts, in line with state guidelines to gradually ramp up production. 
It was not clear how many workers clocked in across various industrial clusters. 
Cabada urged residents to maintain health measures because of a still high infection rate, while noting the need to jump-start the economy of one of Mexico's main factory hubs supplying foreign automakers.
""There are many examples of desperation ... of people with nothing to eat,"" Cabada said.
Labor advocates questioned whether the reboot was safe despite new measures, such as at  Lear  Corp (N:LEA), which saw 20 employees killed by the coronavirus. 
""We're not sure companies are going to take all their precautions,"" said Julia Quinonez, coordinator of the Workers' Border Committee. 
Mexico's government, which has tallied 10,167 deaths from the coronavirus, allowed automotive, aerospace, construction and mining companies to reopen on Monday. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador traveled to Quintana Roo state to launch construction of a tourist train. 
Rene Espinosa, president of Chihuahua state's Aerospace Cluster, acknowledged that the coronavirus may still hit workers. 

""We know it might happen, but we'll be able to catch them with the filters and protocols we have,"" he said.

The plan will use 400 billion yuan ($56 billion) from a separate program to buy 40% of un-collateralized loans to small and medium-sized firms with maturities of at least six months made between Mar. 1 and Dec. 31, 2020, the People’s Bank of China (OTC:BACHY) said Monday.
Commercial lenders should repay the central bank the funds a year after the transaction. The lenders will continue to receive interest payments from the borrower and will bear any losses if the loans go sour, the PBOC said. The central bank will sign contracts with qualified local commercial lenders via a special-purpose vehicle, and the plan could boost banks’ un-collateralized loans to small firms by one trillion yuan, it said.
The central bank is trying to bring down borrowing costs across the economy to stimulate demand and help China grow out of the slump in first quarter caused by the pandemic. By taking loans to small businesses on to its balance sheet, the PBOC may help lower lenders’ capital requirements and thereby lower the cost of further lending.
While the authorities have cut policy rates multiple times this year, they’ve avoided the large-scale stimulus seen in other major economies to avoid aggravating the country’s debt problem. The central bank has announced a number of smaller policy changes.
The program “reflects policy makers’ top priority to support SMEs amid the aftershock of Covid-19,” while not willing to expand its balance sheet to flood the market, said Xing Zhaopeng, a markets economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Shanghai. “We expect the PBOC will not end the program as it described in the statement. In fact, this starts the QE process to lend cheap funds directly to the real economy.”
The central bank also announced Monday that small companies would be allowed to delay loan repayments to March 2021. Combined, the two new policies would make monetary policy more “direct” in increasing loans to the real economy and help stabilize funding flows to small firms and improve their access to credit.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say..
“We think the quota may expand further in the future, depending on how the economy is recovering from the impact of the coronavirus. The effectiveness of the policy move remains an important consideration -- banks may still face constraints in regulatory requirements (such as capital adequacy) and risk-aversion sentiment.”

CHICAGO/BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - State-owned Chinese firms bought at least three cargoes of U.S. soybeans on Monday, even as sources in China said the government had told them to halt purchases after Washington said it would eliminate special treatment for Hong Kong to punish Beijing.
The purchases, totaling at least 180,000 tonnes of the oilseed, were for shipment in October or November, the peak U.S. soy export season when American soybeans are usually the cheapest in the world, three U.S. traders with knowledge of the deals said.
It was not immediately clear why buying continued after Beijing's message to state-owned firms, but U.S. traders said Chinese importers still have not covered a large share of October and November soybean needs.
""It's murky, really hard to say,"" said one U.S. export trader. ""Maybe they wanted to knock a few cents off the price, or maybe there's some other agenda. The do need the beans.""
Earlier, two sources familiar with the matter said China had told state-owned firms to halt large-scale U.S. soybean and pork purchases, and one of the sources said state purchases of U.S. corn and cotton have also been put on hold.
The soybean sales on Monday were small compared to recent purchases by state-owned firms totaling 1 million tonnes or more at a time.
China is ready to suspend imports of more American agriculture products if Washington takes further action on Hong Kong, the sources said. 
Any sustained halt in buying would further threaten progress toward goals reached under the Phase 1 trade deal signed in January. China pledged to significantly boost purchases of U.S. agricultural products, after slashing imports during the bruising trade war.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Trade Representative's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was directing his administration to begin the process of eliminating special treatment for Hong Kong in response to China's plans to impose new security legislation.
On Monday, China said U.S. attempts to harm Chinese interests will be met with firm countermeasures.
(GRAPHIC - Value of U.S. agriculture exports to China: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/yzdvxdxdzvx/USAGExportstoChinaMar2020.png) 
Chinese importers canceled 10,000 to 20,000 tonnes of American pork shipments, equivalent to roughly one week's orders in recent months following Trump's comments on Friday, the source said. 
In a worst-case scenario, if Trump continues to target China, Beijing will scrap the Phase 1 deal, a second source familiar with the government plan said.
""There's no way Beijing can buy goods from the U.S. when receiving constant attacks from Trump,"" the person said. 
U.S. corn, wheat and lean hog futures weakened on Monday due to concerns about rising trade tensions. Soybeans were flat. [GRA/]
Under the initial trade deal, China pledged to buy an additional $32 billion worth of U.S. agriculture products over two years above a baseline based on 2017 figures.
The USDA reported that China bought $1.028 billion worth of soybeans and $691 million of pork in the first quarter of 2020. China also bought corn, wheat and soyoil this year.
China has also been purchasing soybeans in recent weeks from Brazil, during that country's peak export season.
Private Chinese importers have not received a government order to suspend all buying, although commercial buyers are very cautious, according to a third source with a major trading house.
""A certain scale of trade will be halted"" but it is not a full stop, said a fourth source familiar with government plan.
China could easily find other sellers of farm products, he added.

The sources all declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.

1641,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>","'Lemon' or not, Trump stuck with Phase 1 China trade deal for now","By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has little choice but to stick with his Phase 1 China trade deal for now despite his anger at Beijing over the coronavirus pandemic, new Hong Kong security rules, and dwindling hopes China can meet U.S. goods purchase targets, people familiar with his administration's deliberations say. 
The U.S.-China trade negotiations took more than two years, heaped tariffs on $370 billion of Chinese products, whipsawed financial markets and dimmed global growth prospects well before the coronavirus outbreak crushed them.
In recent weeks, suggestions that Trump may cancel the deal have emanated from the White House almost daily, and businesses, investors, and China trade watchers are hanging onto every word and tweet.
But on Friday, when Trump said the United States would start dismantling trade and travel privileges for Hong Kong, he did not mention the deal. Stock markets heaved a sigh of relief, with the S&P 500 reversing losses. 
Talking tough on China and criticizing the Obama administration's more measured approach is a key part of Trump's re-election strategy. Sticking with the pact may mean accepting that China is likely to fall short of purchase commitments for U.S. agricultural goods, manufactured products, energy and services - goals that many said were unrealistic https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/china-to-ramp-up-u-s-buys-under-trade-deal-but-skeptics-question-targets-idUSKBN1ZD0FN even before the pandemic.
In response to Trump's Hong Kong announcement, China told state-owned firms to suspend large-scale farm purchases including soybeans and pork, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Such a halt will put China further behind in making good on its pledges to boost U.S. purchases by $200 billion over two years. 
But canceling the deal would reignite the nearly two-year U.S.-China trade war at a time U.S. unemployment is at its worst since the 1930s Great Depression.
The next U.S. step would likely be reviving previously planned but canceled tariffs on some $165 billion worth of Chinese consumer goods, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) cellphones and computers, toys and clothing - all ultimately paid by U.S. companies and passed on to consumers. Beijing would retaliate with tariffs on U.S. goods, fueling more market turmoil and delaying recovery.
""He's stuck with a lemon. He gets an empty agreement if he sticks with it, and he gets more actions that create an economic drag and more volatility if he abandons it,"" said one person briefed on the administration's trade deliberations.
U.S. goods exports https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html to China in the first quarter were down $4 billion from the trade war-damaged levels a year earlier, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
The Peterson Institute of International Economics estimates https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/us-china-phase-one-tracker-chinas-purchases-us-goods that during the first quarter, China made only about 40% of the purchases it needed to stay on target for a first-year increase of $77 billion over 2017 levels, implying an extremely steep climb in the second half.
Leaving the deal now would not buy a lasting political bounce for Trump in manufacturing-heavy swing states with five months to go before the presidential election, analysts say.
COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP 
Trump said on Friday that China was ""absolutely smothering Hong Kong’s freedom,"" but refrained from harsh sanctions that could put the trade deal in jeopardy, taking milder steps to revoke the territory's separate travel and customs benefits from China. 
Claire Reade, a former U.S. trade negotiator, said Trump's ""peripheral steps"" would not deter Beijing from proceeding with the security law, as it regards Hong Kong as a core national security issue. 
""Probably the most significant thing from the trade perspective is that the Phase 1 trade deal is – for now anyway - unaffected,"" said Reade, senior counsel with Arnold and Porter law firm in Washington. 
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has recently cited https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2020/may/usda-and-ustr-announce-continued-progress-implementation-us-china-phase-one-agreement ""continuing progress"" in the deal, after China welcomed U.S. blueberries, barley, beef and dairy products. 
U.S.-China flashpoints on Hong Kong, Taiwan and other issues did not derail negotiations that resulted in new concessions from China, said Jamieson Greer, who served as Lighthizer's chief of staff until April.
""Some of these security and human rights challenges have certainly complicated the atmosphere, but the trade agreement can still provide a set of rules governing important aspects of the trade relationship,"" said Greer, now an international trade partner at the King and Spalding law firm.

Another person familiar with USTR thinking said the agency ""needs to make Phase 1 look good. They want to show that progress is being made. The president looks at the China relationship much more broadly.""

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African shoppers filled trolleys with cases of beer and cider and bottles of whiskey and wine on Monday as the government eased the coronavirus lockdown to allow the sale of alcohol to resume after a nine-week ban.
South Africa, which has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption per capita in the world, banned the sale of liquor in late March to ease hospital workloads and prevent a rise in domestic violence related to alcohol abuse during lockdown.
Under looser restrictions, alcohol will be sold for home consumption from Mondays to Thursdays, a welcome relief for an industry on its knees due to the ban.
""There is a significant amount of profit lost, we were losing turnover every day,"" Jimmy Constantinou, who has been managing a liquor store in Johannesburg's Alexandra township for six years, told Reuters inside the busy store.
""It's obviously good that we're open again but in terms of business it's going to take a while to get there.""
An estimated 117,600 jobs have been lost in the industry, with 13% of the craft beer sector in the process of shutting, while the wine industry was in severe distress, said Rico Basson, chief executive of Vinpro, a wine industry body.
A few kilometres from the township, more than 100 people snaked around the parking lot of Makro Liquor, owned by Massmart (J:MSMJ), with bottle store owners loading cases of beer and cider onto pick-up trunks.
Software developer Teboho Mofokeng waited in the queue for more than two hours for his six bottles of whiskey, saying his alcohol stock ran out during lockdown.
""I've been without liquor for some time now,"" he said. ""I'm over-excited and relieved.""
Retailers like Pick n Pay (J:PIKJ) and Shoprite's Checkers supermarket chain (J:SHPJ), had allowed customers to place pre-orders online for delivery from Monday.
Some retailers placed limits on purchases, with Checkers limiting online orders to 120 litres per order.

Online alcohol stores and delivery apps were dealing with high volumes of orders after President Cyril Ramaphosa's announcement to further reopen the economy.

1643,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 10:05AM ET</span>",China c.bank to buy bank loans to spur lending to small firms worth 1 trln yuan,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's central bank is to start buying bank loans made by local lenders to small firms this week to try to prod banks to lend as much as 1 trillion yuan ($140.18 billion) to small businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Purchases of the loans, on a quarterly basis, from banks that qualify, such as city commercial banks, rural commercial banks, rural cooperatives and private banks, would hit 400 billion yuan under a special relending quota, the People's Bank of China (OTC:BACHY) (PBOC) said on its website. 
The qualifying banks need to buy back the loans after a year and the PBOC would not bear the credit risks if the loans go sour, it added. 
It expects the move to help spur new bank loans to small businesses worth about 1 trillion yuan. 
The PBOC has long complained about the logjams in its monetary policy transmission mechanism that often sees funds flowing to the property and stock markets. 
In a separate statement, the PBOC asked banks to shift their business focus from lending to property firms and local government financing vehicles that fund infrastructure projects to small businesses. 
China's economy shrank 6.8% in the first quarter from a year earlier, the first contraction since quarterly records began. Analysts believe it will be months before broader activity returns to pre-crisis levels, even if a fresh wave of infections can be avoided.
In order to help banks extend loan payments for small firms, the PBOC also announced that it would provide 40 billion yuan in relending funds and conduct interest rate swaps with local banks through a special purpose vehicle (SPV).
The loan extension supporting tool would help banks extend loan principal for about 3.7 trillion yuan, it added. 
Premier Li Keqiang said in his work report last month that the government is extending loan payments for small and micro-sized business until the end of March next year.

1644,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>",Rich world's jobs crisis jolts money flows to millions,"By Nelson Renteria, Drazen Jorgic and Sofia Menchu
(Reuters) - Carlos Sosa, a Salvadoran waiter in New York, used to send up to $500 a month back home to his mother to help pay for her medical bills and food. But now, after the coronavirus hit and he lost his job in early March, Sosa has burned through his savings and the wire transfers have stopped.
The 42-year old says he is struggling to pay for even his own rent and is concerned for his mother. “It’s been a very tough situation,” said Sosa, who is in the middle of processing his U.S. residency papers. “The economic part is the most traumatic of all this.""
Lockdowns imposed by wealthy nations to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, and the jolt those restrictions have delivered to their economies, are severing a vital lifeline for many often vulnerable people around the world: the billions of dollars in remittances sent home by relatives working abroad.
Roughly one in nine of the global population receives remittances, or about 800 million people, according to the United Nations. Early data show severe drops have already taken place. El Salvador saw remittances collapse 40% in April from a year earlier, to $287.3 million, according to the country’s central bank.
Sosa says he looking for a new job but the ones available feel risky, involving cleaning places like trains or hospitals. He has warned his mother that there would be no more wire transfers for some time. As he told her: “We will have to see how we survive this because things here are difficult.”
GLOBAL IMPACT
The World Bank has said it expects global remittances to low- and middle-income nations to fall by $109 billion, or almost a fifth, in 2020 to $445 billion. The bank projects the pandemic will cut into the wages and employment of migrant workers, who tend to be the most vulnerable when there is an economic downturn in host countries.
The steep drop in remittances carries dire consequences for the many countries around the world that are heavily dependent on such payments and whose economies are already reeling from a slump in demand triggered by the coronavirus crisis. The risks range from rising poverty and hunger to balance-of-payments emergencies for developing economies reliant on the cash.
The vulnerable spots include India, China and Mexico, the top recipients of remittances by value, according to the World Bank. The Philippines, the fourth-biggest recipient of remittances, has nearly one in 20 of its adult population working abroad.
Mimi Ysulat used to send home up to HK$2000 a month, or about $260, to her husband and children in Antique province in the Philippines. But the Hong Kong couple whose children she had looked after for nine years have told her to stop working as of late April. Now, the 49-year-old can think of only one way to get money for her family to survive: ""Borrow from my sister, borrow from my friend. Just borrow, borrow, borrow.""
The impact could be felt more acutely in emerging and frontier market economies even more dependent on transfers. El Salvador and neighboring Honduras are particularly vulnerable. Both received remittances that amounted to about a fifth of their gross domestic product in 2018, according to World Bank data. Analysts say that cash bolstered the countries’ construction sectors, stimulated consumption and helped many out of poverty.
The world’s two largest sources of remittance payments have been severely disrupted. The United States, which tops the World Bank’s list, accounting for some $68.50 billion of payments globally in 2018, has seen unemployment skyrocket, with more than 40 million jobs lost since March. The Gulf economies, the world’s No. 2 source, have been hammered by lower oil prices.
LATIN REMITTANCES: BOOM TO BUST
The tightening of the U.S. remittance spigot is expected to reverse a multi-year boom in payments to families in Latin America. Until early this year, Latin American migrants were funneling record-high sums from the United States, according to central bank data and U.S.-based think tank Inter-American Dialogue. The strong U.S. economy had been the main driver of flows. Remittance specialists also say President Donald Trump's campaign to halt immigration had helped boost the money flow as migrants saved more in case of deportations.
Remittances to Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador hit a combined record of $57.7 billion last year, central bank data show. Those four countries accounted for about 64% of the 10.5 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States in 2017, according to the most recent estimates from the Pew Research Center.
Early data suggests a collapse in remittances as the coronavirus, and the COVID-19 disease it causes, spread across the United States. Sectors such as food service and hospitality that employ large numbers of immigrants saw jobs vanish almost overnight.
In April, remittances to Guatemala had already fallen by 20% from a year earlier, to $690.7 million. It was a major about-turn for a country that as recently as February was showing remittance growth of 17% from the prior year, according to the country’s central bank. Guatemala received $10.5 billion of remittances last year, the equivalent of almost 14% of the nation’s economy. 
Elizabeth, who lives near Guatemala’s capital city, used to receive about $1,200 a month from her daughter’s fiancé, who worked as a cook in the United States. But the payments stopped after coronavirus shuttered the two diners he worked at and dried up his other side jobs.
The money had helped pay for Elizabeth’s treatment for stomach cancer at a semi-private hospital and regular visits from a nurse, as well as food and other basics. The future looks bleak, said 69-year old Elizabeth, appearing frail as she stood in the doorway of her home near Guatemala City in early May.
""Now I only ask God to help us, and to help all those people who lost their jobs in the United States and here,” she said.
Guatemala’s central bank president, Sergio Recinos, said declines in remittances generally have a significant impact on his country’s economy. About half of remittances go towards consumer spending, he noted, and about 30% are spent on construction. He said a negative impact is already being felt in the construction sector.
“IT’S BRUTAL”
Nicaragua-based AirPak, a remittance heavyweight operating  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Co. franchises in many Central American countries, said that by the end of April, year-on-year flows were down by about 20% across its network, which operates with 26 brands, including MoneyGram. The median value of each transaction declined by about a fifth as well.
""It's brutal"", said Piero Coen, chief executive of AirPak, which says it handles about a fifth of all remittances flowing to the region.
Western Union’s chief financial officer, Raj Agrawal, told Reuters that the second quarter may be the low point for the world's largest money transfer firm. He expects the business to improve in coming months amid economic stimulus packages.
Still, the loss of income is expected to shake Latin American economies, especially Central American states, where past periods of economic hardship fueled gang violence and waves of immigration to the United States.
In Mexico, most remittances come from the United States. Mexico saw a surge in transfers in March - which some analysts attributed to fears of deterioration of employment prospects in the United States and favorable exchange rates. But some analysts estimate remittances could shrink more than 21% between 2020 and 2021.
The slowing flow is felt in the small town of San Bartolomé Quialana in Mexico’s southern Oaxaca state, population 2,500. The money sent back to the town over the years has helped reduce poverty across generations and fuel a multi-year construction boom, according to the town’s mayor, Victoriano Gomez Martinez.
But several empty building sites point to the pause in flow of cash from the United States. On a plot of land Francisco Mesinas was developing with cash from his three children in Los Angeles, metal rods stick out of the foundations of the construction site, while stacked concrete slabs and piles of shingle lay untouched with no workers in sight.
The 30,000 Mexican pesos ($1,364.26) to 60,000 Mexican pesos($2,728.51) Mesinas' two sons and daughter had been sending each month for the project has dried up completely, after all three children lost their restaurant jobs in Los Angeles.
Standing on red dirt on a site where three houses are to be erected, along with a space for a café and a small business, Mesinas said: “The work has stopped. They couldn’t send money for this.”

1645,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 08:54AM ET</span>",Texas Is Showing the World How to Reopen Cautiously,"(Bloomberg) --
Over Memorial Day weekend, a club in Houston hosted a pool party that looked straight out of spring break, with loads of bulky bare chests, bikinis and day drinking on an umbrella-filled patio during a balmy Saturday.
A day earlier, Texas Governor Greg Abbott allowed bars—along with rodeos, bowling alleys and bingo halls—to open their doors at reduced capacity in the second phase of the state’s plan to restart the economy after shutting down in early April to slow the coronavirus.
The scene at Clé Houston, which quickly spread on social media, played to stereotypes of Texans—libertarian, don’t-tread-on-me types who prize personal freedom. But the reality of how many of the state’s citizens are behaving is much different. In other parts of the city that Saturday, bars were tame, even boring, with sparse attendance and plenty of crowd control. Some owners marked tables and floors with an X to reinforce social distancing. Another set out squeeze bottles filled with hand sanitizer.
South Padre Island, this was not.
A month into the reopening of one of America’s biggest economic engines, Texas looks a lot like those other Houston watering holes: cautiously coming back from the shutdown. Using a variety of data measuring all kinds of activity—from dining out to how frequently people leave their homes—a picture of the Lone Star State emerges that raises doubts about the pace of the economic recovery. For months, the big question has been how quickly Americans will bounce back. Looking at Texas, the answer is that it’s going to be a while.
Concerns erupted a month ago that coronavirus infections could surge after the state eased social-distancing measures—in just one example, prominent Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke called the Republican governor’s plan “dangerous.” And in the past five days, there’s been an uptick in reported cases, though the rate of gains over the past seven weeks has been stable at about 1,000 a day. Texans appear to have evolved from a lockdown, which they took less seriously than other states, into a middle ground that hasn’t yet led to new outbreaks.
Restaurants reopened on May 1 at reduced capacity, and so far only about a third of the state’s sit-down dining has returned, according to OpenTable. In major cities, the rebound is even more muted. Transactions at restaurants, including takeout and delivery, have tripled since late March, but are still down 50% from before the pandemic, according to Shift4, a payments processor. 
Clark Cooper Concepts operates a handful of high-end eateries in Houston, but one location has remained closed because the staff doesn’t want to risk exposure or would rather collect unemployment for now, according to Grant Cooper, one of the group’s partners. And when more customers do venture out, they’ll encounter a starkly different atmosphere than what they’re used to, he said.
“It’s like a high school mixer where everyone’s awkward,” Cooper said of dining during a pandemic. Even when the state ups capacity limits past the current 50%, he’s not sure how much of a difference that will make since they’ll still have to maintain six feet of distance. Plus, “a lot of people have learned in a short period of time that they have an oven and can cook something at home.”
Tony Goncalves, a 59-year-old from Tomball, about 30 miles north of Houston, has avoided restaurants and a lot of other pursuits because of the hassle of the Covid-19 era, not health concerns.
“I’m not going to a restaurant if I gotta sit there with a mask, you know?” said Goncalves, a project manager for a pipeline company. “I mean, how do you eat? Until it becomes a lot more convenient to do things, then I would just continue doing what I need to.”
A lot of Texans appear to have adopted a similar mentality, either seeking out convenience or necessities. Supercuts has seen visits surge past where they were a year ago, according to foot traffic data on more than 30 standalone locations monitored by SafeGraph, an analytics firm that tracks mobile phones. Traffic to Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which has remained open because it’s deemed an essential retailer for its grocery, is also above 2019.
That’s not to say people aren’t indulging. They’re flooding Whataburger, a drive-thru chain that in March added the ability to deliver its sweet & spicy bacon burger to your parked car. Rudy’s Country Store and Bar-B-Q, with more than 30 restaurants in the state, also has a robust pick-up business and its customer traffic drastically rebounded over the past month. Trips to Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Baskin-Robbins are almost back to normal, according to SafeGraph.
Meanwhile, malls all over the state are struggling to lure back customers. Hotel transactions, including bookings, have only rebounded 37% since hitting a nadir on March 22, according to Shift4.
The earliest that Billy Bob’s, a Fort Worth dance hall that calls itself the world’s largest honky-tonk, might open is June 8 and returning to concerts might be a month after that, according to General Manager Marty Travis. Even at the state-mandated 25% capacity (for now, bars are more restricted than restaurants), the venue could still hold 1,500 people. As added precaution, it’s considering installing thermal cameras to detect fevers in employees and patrons.
“We’re coming up on our 40th anniversary next year, and the last thing I need to do is become a hot spot,” Travis said. “The wise decision was to sit tight for a hot minute.”
Airports are largely empty. At Dallas Fort Worth International, the second largest airport in the country, scheduled daily departures are averaging about 500, roughly half the rate from February, according to tracking website Flightradar24. Offices can reopen, but many haven’t, instead opting to keep their staff working from home.
“We’re not in a rush to come back,” said Stephanie Boone, the 42-year-old founder of Wondercide, a 30-person company that makes pest protection products in Austin for nationwide distribution. “Working remote is working for us.”
During the weekday morning rush last week, a main artery into Dallas looked like a Sunday afternoon. In the city’s downtown, about the only cars on the road were FedEx (NYSE:FDX) trucks.
“Economic activity has improved from abysmally low to just drastically low,” said James Gaines, chief economist at Texas A&M University’s Real Estate Center. An index of the state’s economy curated by the school plunged to around 40 earlier this month from 120 in March. In the last week, it’s rebounded to the mid-50s.
Given the state’s diversity, there are regional divides in behavior, even within the same city. In the districts north of Dallas, largely white and affluent, residents are leaving their homes much more than a month ago, according to SafeGraph data. Meanwhile the black communities south of the city, which have been hit hard by the virus, have actually seen reduced mobility since the reopening.
In Austin, a politically-liberal enclave, there are lower levels of movement and business activity. In one sign of the dichotomy, a major mall has only seen a small lift in traffic since the reopening. Meanwhile in Midland, deep within the state’s conservative oil-producing Permian Basin, a big shopping center appears to already be back to normal levels of visitors, according to SafeGraph data.
These differences, of course, come amid President Donald Trump turning virus prevention into a partisan issue, by refusing to wear a mask and criticizing states that have kept economic activity under wraps.
“I definitely see a divide along political lines,” said Matt Asendio, a Houston real estate agent who’s witnessed interest in home buying rebound the past two weeks. “There are people who are out and about and aren’t social distancing like you’d like, and a second group that is staying at home.”
Tara Chapman realized the stark differences just 10 minutes outside Austin at a gas station where social distancing was non-existent. Later during her trip last weekend to the Hill Country, she stopped at a taco shop and the only person wearing a mask besides her and her boyfriend was an employee, and her nose wasn’t covered.
Chapman, 38, runs Two Hives Honey, an eight-person Austin beekeeping company that has survived the pandemic by boosting online sales. The company so far hasn’t brought back group events, like hive tours and classes, that had accounted for a third of revenue.
“Austin is taking it a lot more slowly,” Chapman said. “We just aren’t there yet.”
Methodology: SafeGraph device location data analyzed for this story has been adjusted for geographic sampling bias and for daily fluctuations in number of detected devices, relative to April 1, 2020.

1646,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>",Wall Street and Fed fly blind as coronavirus upends annual stress tests,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. financial regulators, banks and their investors will get their first glimpse into the health of the nation's banking system as it confronts soaring corporate and consumer defaults in the economic crisis sparked by the novel coronavirus. 
And no-one, including the U.S. Federal Reserve which sets the annual bank ""stress test"" exams, has a clue what to expect.
“That is the $100,000 question. Actually, it’s much bigger than that and I am sure the Fed is working hard to get it right. We’re curious, and we don’t have clarity,"" said Kevin Fromer, CEO of the Financial Services Forum, which represents the biggest banks in the U.S.
That could mean banks may be on the hook for billions more in capital than they had anticipated, which could ultimately force them to slash dividends, slim down their balance sheets or reduce lending. 
Since the 2009 financial crisis, the Fed has tested annually a snapshot of big bank balance sheets against an extreme hypothetical economic shock. The results ultimately dictate how much capital banks can dish out to shareholders. 
This year, however, the real life economic blow dealt by the pandemic has by several measures exceeded the doomsday scenario the Fed unveiled in February, leading some banks to grumble it may as well scrap the tests this year.
Instead, the Fed told banks after they had handed in their exam papers in April that it was adding an extra test to reflect the rapid deterioration of economic conditions in recent months.
That eleventh-hour change combined with other tweaks the Fed passed last year has thrown the stress test playbook out the window. 
""Unnecessarily increasing bank capital could serve to limit bank balance sheets at exactly the wrong time, likely chilling economic recovery,"" the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association wrote in a note on Friday in which it urged the Fed to stick to its original plan.
While the banking sector has so far proved resilient, some Fed officials worry it will come under greater stress as mass unemployment leads to more corporate and consumer debt defaults, according to minutes from the Fed's April meeting.
The country's largest four lenders - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) - combined put aside $20 billion to cover expected loan losses in the first quarter alone. Those lenders, alongside  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), are among the 34 banks to best tested this year.
Banks say they are in the dark about the potential outcome because the Fed hasn't provided any details on how the extra analysis will work or which factors it plans to probe.
Some analysts expect the central bank to adjust for more job losses, which has already blown through the 10% level outlined in its February scenario, and to significantly raise lenders' potential loan loss rates from the roughly 6% of previous years. 
Nellie Liang, a former Fed official who is now a senior fellow at Brookings Institution, said the central bank will likely also probe banks' exposures to struggling sectors like hotels.
""From a credibility standpoint, they need to be very severe, not just try to catch up with what's already happened,"" said Tim Clark, another former Fed official who helped build the stress tests and now works with the advocacy group Better Markets. 
Regulatory changes to the tests agreed before the pandemic have created another unknown. This year the Fed will integrate the stress test results with other capital rules so as to better tailor banks' overall capital level to their business mix.
Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods and Evercore ISI have said they expect the tests to result overall in less excess capital which may force banks to cut dividends. While the Fed declined to comment, some officials have said lenders should be prepared for that outcome, according to the April minutes. 

But with pressure from the government and lawmakers to keep banks lending, some analysts are leaning the other way. Goldman Sachs said in a note last week that while the Fed could order higher bank capital, it may actually lower requirements ""given the extra-ordinary demands on balance sheets.""

1648,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 06:24AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday, June 1st","By Peter Nurse  
Investing.com -- America is on edge as protests against police brutality, some turning violent, continue throughout the nation, while tensions between China and the U.S. continue to escalate. The oil industry is also in focus with OPEC potentially meeting early to discuss further output cuts. And there's the May U.S. ISM manufacturing PMI data to study. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 1st June.
1. U.S. on edge; protests turn violent
What started as a peaceful demonstration against police killings of black people after the death of George Floyd as he was restrained by Minneapolis police officers has turned into violent protests that have ravaged cities from Philadelphia to Los Angeles and flared near the White House.
Pressure is mounting on President Donald Trump, as he faces accusations of inciting racial violence as he appeared to call on his supporters to counter-protest outside the White House. He has also said the U.S. will designate the far-left Antifa group a 'terrorist organisation'.
The turmoil was a fresh setback for the economy which was only just emerging from a downturn akin to the Great Depression. Following poor data on spending and trade out on Friday, the Atlanta Federal Reserve estimated economic output could drop a staggering 51% annualised in the second quarter.
2. Trump pulls back from the edge with China, for now
Financial markets tuned in nervously to President Trump’s response Friday to China’s decision to impose a national security law on Hong Kong. In the end, the president said he would strip Hong Kong of its special status with the U.S., but didn’t renounce the recently signed trade deal with China, as the market had feared.
Still, relations between the two economic superpowers are particularly tense, and such a move can’t be ruled out in the future, especially as the U.S. presidential election draws nearer.
Bloomberg reported Monday that Chinese government officials have told major state-run agricultural firms to pause purchases of some American farm goods, including soybeans, as Beijing looks to evaluate the recent escalation in tensions between the two nations.
“If Trump wants to increase his chances of beating Biden in November, then he needs to turn even tougher than China than he currently is,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note.
3. Stocks set to open lower; Goldman turns more positive
U.S. stock markets are set to open a little lower, after posting a positive month in May. Continuing disturbances throughout the country on top of heightened tensions with China will likely weigh on the market ahead of the release of ISM manufacturing PMI data. 
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 futures contract was down 26 points or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 0.2% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 0.4%.
Still, on a more positive note, Goldman Sachs has abandoned its call for another steep sell-off.
The investment bank has rolled back its prediction that the S&P 500 would slump to the 2,400 level -- over 20% below Friday’s 3,044 close -- and now see downside risks capped at 2,750. The U.S. equity benchmark could even rally further to 3,200.
“The powerful rebound means our previous three-month target of 2,400 is unlikely to be realized,” the strategists wrote. “Monetary and fiscal policy support limit likely downside to roughly 10%. Investor positioning has oscillated between neutral and low and is a possible 5% upside catalyst.”
In Asia, the benchmark Nikkei index gained 0.8%. In Europe, with Germany closed for a June 1 public holiday, the FTSE 100 in London and the CAC 40 in Paris both rose 1%.
4. ISM Manufacturing PMI on the data slate
This week will see little of Federal Reserve officials as they are now in the traditional blackout period ahead of their next policy meeting later this month, but there will be plenty of economic data to study.
Friday sees the important nonfarm payrolls release, but ahead of that comes ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index for May, at 10 AM ET. 
This is expected to show an improvement in sentiment in the manufacturing sector, with the index expected to climb to 43.0 from 41.5 in April, as parts of the U.S. economy started to emerge from the lockdown.
However, an improvement isn’t a given. Nordea said, in a research note, that it wouldn’t be a surprise to see an even weaker reading in May, citing a disappointing Weekly Economic Index release from the New York Fed as well as the April index having not dropped as much as had been expected.
The news from Europe wasn't particularly encouraging, as although manufacturers in the euro zone appear to have passed their nadir, activity is still contracting sharply.
5. OPEC meeting this week?
Oil prices have been on the tear of late, with the front-month Brent and WTI contracts posting their strongest monthly gains in years in May as crude production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, dropped to its lowest level in two decades.
To solidify this change in sentiment, Algeria, which currently holds the OPEC presidency, has proposed that an OPEC+ meeting planned for June 9-10 be brought forward to this Thursday.
One of the topics of discussion will likely be an extension of the current cuts of 9.7 million barrels a day for between one to two months. Under the current deal, the group is scheduled to reduce the scale of cuts to 7.7 million barrels a day from July. 
“A shorter period may make an extension more palatable to the Russians, who were not keen to extend current cuts through until the end of this year, which was reportedly suggested by other members of the deal,” said ING, in a research note to clients.

1650,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>",Japan's April tax revenues see biggest monthly drop in over a decade,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's tax revenue dropped 29.4% in April compared with a year earlier, finance ministry data showed on Monday, posting its biggest monthly year-on-year decline since August 2009, after the payment deadline was pushed back due to COVID-19.
Analysts expect further slides over a protracted period as the coronavirus outbreak deals a heavy blow to the economy.
They said this raised the prospect of further debt issuance to make up the income gap as the government boosts spending in Japan, which has the heaviest public debt burden among major economies at more than twice its $5 trillion economy.
The government will submit a second extra budget to parliament early next week to fund a new, $1.1 trillion stimulus package to soften the economic blow from the pandemic, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said earlier on Monday.
""Taking a long-term view, it will be necessary to take a proper look at the fiscal deficit,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.
Sera said she was worried about the long-term effect of accumulating more public debt, which could raise doubts about the sustainability of Japan's economy.

A finance ministry official attributed April's large year-on-year drop to a one-month delay of the deadline for filing annual tax returns, including for income tax. The delay in the income tax reporting deadline caused receipts of the tax to drop 88.5%.
In April corporate tax receipts slipped 5.0% on the year, while total tax revenue until that month stood at 52.3 trillion yen ($486 billion).
Japan lifted a state of emergency for Tokyo and four remaining areas last week after coronavirus infections slowed as it tries to reopen the economy.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea on Monday cut its economic projections for this year to growth of just 0.1%, which would be the worst performance since the 1998 Asian financial crisis, as the coronavirus pandemic hit exports, consumption and corporate investment.
That is sharply down from its previous projection of a 2.4% expansion made before the outbreak and comes after compiling a total of 250 trillion won stimulus package -- 13.1% of gross domestic product -- to combat the virus fallout.
The government's view that growth will ground to a virtual halt is slightly better than an expected 0.2% contraction seen by the Bank of Korea, and a 1.2% decline projected by the International Monetary Fund. 
""(The coronavirus outbreak) led to an unprecedented slump in domestic demand, which maximised fears and caused shock in financial and labour markets,"" Deputy Finance Minister Bahng Ki-sun told a briefing prepared for the release on Monday.
""Recovery in domestic demand will likely be limited due to deepening slump in external demand and uneasy sentiment, and can worsen if the second wave materialises ahead of winter,"" he added.
South Korea's economy grew 2.0% in 2019 and the new growth target would be the slowest since a 5.1% contraction seen in 1998 Asian financial crisis.
Outside the coronavirus, tensions between China and the United States over Beijing's policy on Hong Kong could further derail recovery, the nation's finance ministry said. 
Breakdown of forecasts showed private consumption for the whole of 2020 is expected to slip 1.2% from a year earlier, far worse than a projection of 2.1% growth set in December.
Exports are also expected to shrink 8.0%, sharply down from 3.0% growth seen earlier.
Factory shutdowns and various measures to contain the virus, including social activity restrictions, have hit household and business spending.

The BOK cut its policy rate to a record low last week, working in tandem with the government to extend liquidity to businesses hit by the coronavirus pandemic.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said eight insurers, including Hiscox and QBE, will take part in a test case to decide whether their policies should compensate companies hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
A national lockdown has triggered insurance claims from companies seeking compensation for having to shut down their activities as a result of the coronavirus crisis.
The FCA said last month it would seek clarity from the courts on whether the wording of some insurance policies should provide cover during the pandemic.
The FCA said on Monday it has selected 17 examples from business interruption insurance policies used by 16 insurers.
""We expect the test case to provide guidance for the interpretation of many other business insurance policies that are not in the representative sample,"" the FCA said.
A subset of eight insurers were asked to take part in the court case, including Hiscox, QBE, Royal & Sun Alliance and MS Amlin, the FCA said in a statement.
The insurers have entered into a framework agreement with the regulator governing the process and timetable, it added.
Hiscox said it has agreed to assist in the test case to provide certainty for businesses and brokers on the application of policies as quickly as possible.
The FCA said it expects the court case will happen in the second half of July and last 5-10 days.
""In early July, we expect to publish a comprehensive list of other insurers and many other BI policies in the market that we expect the test case to affect, based on firm submissions,"" it said.

The stimulus measure was introduced to help banks support and finance the private sector, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) said, as the economy suffers from low oil prices and measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
SAMA said the banking sector was ""still registering good performance indicators, enhancing its ability to face challenges and crises.""
Lending to the private sector increased in April by 12.2% year on year and by 0.9% month on month, SAMA data published late on Sunday showed.
The central bank's net foreign assets dropped sharply for a second consecutive month in April as the kingdom used tens of billions of dollars to back investments of its sovereign fund abroad.

1655,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 02:25AM ET</span>",Japan parliament to debate second extra budget for pandemic relief next week,"By Yoshifumi Takemoto and Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government will submit to parliament early next week a second extra budget to fund a new $1.1 trillion stimulus package to cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday.
With ruling and opposition parties on board for big spending to combat the virus fallout, parliament is likely to approve the budget as early as next week.
The move would give Abe ammunition to inject another heavy dose of stimulus to an economy on the brink of deep recession as the pandemic hit global and domestic demand.
""We'd like to submit (the second extra budget) to parliament early next week,"" Abe said in a meeting with ruling party lawmakers. ""We need to protect businesses and jobs.""
Abe's cabinet approved last month the $1.1 trillion stimulus package that includes significant direct spending, having rolled out a package of a similar magnitude in April.
The extra budget needs to get approved by parliament for the stimulus package to take effect.
Notable in the new stimulus package is 10 trillion yen ($93 billion) in reserves set aside for ""emergency"" spending - more than 10-fold the usual amount - that the government can tap for additional needs that arise to battle the pandemic.
Just two months into the new fiscal year beginning in April, the government compiled two extra budgets worth a combined 58 trillion yen to combat the virus shock - about 10% of gross domestic product (GDP) and more than half the size of this year's annual state budget.
""It's clear the government focused on the size of stimulus this time,"" said Hiroshi Ugai, chief Japan economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Securities, who says the two stimulus packages will boost Japan's real GDP this year by 3.2 percentage points.
""It also leaves Japan with an expanded fiscal deficit"" that could draw market attention once the pandemic subsides, he said.
Some analysts say Japan may be forced to compile a third extra budget later this year to take into account an expected slump in tax revenues due to slumping corporate profits.
After years of heavy spending to stimulate a low-growth economy, Japan is saddled with a huge public debt that is twice the size of its economy and the biggest among major industrialised countries.

1656,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 02:15AM ET</span>",No time to waste?: Five questions for the ECB,"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Central Bank meets on Thursday with investors hoping that policymakers will deliver yet more stimulus for an economy ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic.
A 1.85 trillion euro ($2.04 trillion) fiscal package proposed by the European Commission to lift the region's economy eases the pressure to act speedily.
But for many economists the case for more immediate ECB stimulus is compelling -- the euro zone economy contracted at a record rate in the first quarter with an even worse performance anticipated in the second.
Here are five key questions on the radar for markets.
1. By how much could the ECB expand asset purchases?
Delaying fresh stimulus would keep the pressure on Europe's politicians to deliver and allow more time for the ECB to assess how EU bond issuance will impact its asset purchases. 
Many economists nevertheless expect the 750 billion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) to rise by 500 billion euros. ABN Amro thinks it will double in size.
Latest ECB meeting minutes, recent policymaker comments, dire economic data and expectations for a further surge in government spending and bond issuance suggest a June move remains likely, economists say.
(Graphic: The ECB's QE programme - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwvkdamrpm/Pasted%20image%201590680791300.png)
2. Surely Europe's recovery fund plan eases pressure on the ECB? 
The ECB has long urged euro zone leaders to do more to support growth -- hopes that were given a major boost last week by the recovery fund proposal.
The plan still requires unanimous support from EU members and is unlikely to delay more policy action now, economists say.
If ratified, the plan would mark a step towards mutualised debt as a major funding tool for the first time. The prospect of joint EU bonds could encourage the ECB to buy more supranational bonds.
(Graphic: ECB's cumulative public bond buys - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvzqwejpw/Pasted%20image%201590679336970.png)
3. Could the ECB add so-called ""fallen angels"" to QE?
Many analysts expect the ECB to start buying the bonds of companies that have lost their investment-grade credit ratings during the pandemic. But many policymakers are sceptical about buying such risky debt. 
The ECB disappointed markets in April when it chose not to include ""fallen angels"" in quantitative easing, having just eased rules to allow lending against recently junk-rated assets. 
Jeroen van den Broek at ING expects some 100 billion euros-worth of euro zone corporate debt will lose investment-grade status over the next 12-18 months.

(Graphic: Reuters poll-European Central Bank policy outlook: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/jznvnbzglvl/eikon.png)
4. What will the latest economic forecasts show? 
ECB chief Christine Lagarde now expects the euro zone economy to shrink between 8% and 12% this year, against an earlier forecast of a 5% to 12% contraction. 
ECB forecasts due on Thursday are likely to reflect the more bearish commentary and may help justify more stimulus. 
Focus is also on inflation forecasts as the bank has yet to spell out how the coronavirus crisis will impact price growth. 
(Graphic: ECB's growth forecasts - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jznpnbzonpl/Pasted%20image%201590679166411.png)
5. Has the German court ruling dented the ECB's ability to do ""whatever it takes""? 
Germany's constitutional court ruling in May challenges the ECB's independence and threatens to muzzle the central bank's latest bazooka, the PEPP.
The ECB has until August to justify its position or the Bundesbank must stop buying German bonds for the ECB's QE programme. Lagarde will be pressed on Thursday for the central bank's response. 
Sources told Reuters last week that the ECB is drafting contingency plans to carry out its multi-trillion bond-buying programme without the Bundesbank.
Analysts expect the ECB to stress its independence and commitment to its stimulus schemes.
""The court ruling acts more like sand on the wheels rather than changing the outcome. It's a complication to the process, but ultimately it won't change its course, or even slow down the ECB's decision-making,"" said Ilan Solot, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.

1657,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 01:45AM ET</span>",Saudi FX reserves down sharply in April to back wealth fund investments,"By Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi foreign reserves dropped sharply in April for a second consecutive month as the kingdom used tens of billions of dollars to back investments of its sovereign fund abroad while its economy is hit hard by the new coronavirus.
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, is suffering from historic price lows and measures to fight the pandemic which have hurt its non-oil economy.
Facing a collapse in oil revenue and a sharp widening of its deficit this year, between March and April it has transferred $40 billion from its foreign reserves to the Public Investment Fund (PIF) to back investments abroad to maximize returns.
Net foreign assets of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) dropped to $443.75 billion in April from $464.64 billion in March, according to SAMA data published late on Sunday.
Total reserves assets, which include foreign currency and deposits abroad as well as investment in foreign securities, dropped by nearly $25 billion month-on-month in April.
""Excluding the one-off transactions where part of the reserves were transferred to PIF to utilize the opportunity of investing in international markets under current circumstances, we are not seeing any extraordinary outflows in terms of foreign reserves,"" Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters.
SAMA's net foreign assets had dropped by nearly $27 billion month-on-month in March, their fastest rate in at least 20 years.
The reserves depletion coincides with a shift to austerity last month when the country announced a tripling of value added tax (VAT) and the suspension of a cost of living allowance for state employees, in an attempt to shore up its finances.
PIF - the vehicle of choice of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his plans to transform the kingdom into a high-tech, diversified economy - last month disclosed the acquisition of billions of dollars of stakes in listed companies abroad, including Boeing (N:BA),  Citigroup  (N:C), and Facebook (O:FB).
""PIF constantly looks for long-term compelling investment opportunities at attractive prices,"" a spokesman of the fund said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
""The current market environment presents a number of such opportunities, including in sectors and companies that are well positioned to drive economic growth and value creation moving forward beyond the current crisis.""
The fund, with assets estimated at over $300 billion, said one of its sources of funding included capital injections made by the government.

1658,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2020 11:50PM ET</span>","Pandemic set to shrink Australian economy in first quarter, worse yet to come","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economy is expected to have shrunk in the first quarter as the global coronavirus pandemic is set to tip the country into its first recession in three decades.
A Reuters poll of 15 economists forecast the A$2 trillion economy to contract by 0.3% in the three months to March - the first quarterly decline in nine years. 
Annual growth likely slowed to 1.4% from 2.2% in 2019, the survey showed.
If the economy contracts in both the March and June quarters it would be Australia's first technical recession since the early 1990s.
The economic fallout deepened in Australia as the number of local coronavirus cases surged from less than 100 in early March to more than 7,000 now, forcing the government to shut borders and restrict large gatherings. 
The country's central bank stepped in by cutting the cash rate to a record low 0.25% and launching an unlimited bond buying programme. It is widely expected to sit tight at its monthly policy meeting on Tuesday.
Some economists see a small chance of a positive Q1, partly thanks to a run at supermarkets and solid export demand.
""That means Australia might escape 'technical' recession. Again,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) economist Phil Odonaghoe forecasting a 0.1% growth in March quarter.
""Risks to our outlook are to the downside."" 
Even before the coronavirus-related mobility restrictions kicked in, Australia's economy was struggling from a devastating bushfire season, a slowdown in tourism and weak domestic demand. 
""A significant contraction in 2Q is looming,"" Bank of America-Merrill-Lynch analysts wrote in a note. ""Looking ahead, we do not expect a strong rebound in growth into 2021.""

""We expect some of the lost output will not be recovered... Hence, there is risk for unemployment to rise by the end of the year.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) said on Sunday they shuttered stores across the United States as retailers already reeling from closures because of the coronavirus pandemic shut outlets amid protests that included looting in many U.S. cities. 
Protests turned violent in places including New York and Chicago following the death in Minneapolis of a black man, George Floyd, seen on video gasping for breath as a white police officer knelt on his neck.
In Los Angeles, protests led to the looting of the Alexander McQueen clothing store on Rodeo Drive, and a Gucci store on the vaunted strip was marked with the graffiti slogan: ""Eat the rich,"" according to local media reports. 
In the nearby Grove Shopping Center, which houses 51 upscale stores, Nordstrom, Ray Ban and Apple were broken into.  Nordstrom Inc  (NYSE:JWN) temporarily closed all its stores on Sunday, it told Reuters in an emailed statement.
""We hope to reopen our doors as soon as possible,"" the statement said. ""We had impacts at some of them and are in the process of assessing any damage so we can resume serving customers.""
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said in an email statement it also had decided to keep a number of its U.S. stores closed on Sunday. The company did not specify how many stores were closed, or if the closures would be extended. 
The violence was widespread, and Minnesota-based Target said it was closing or limiting hours at more than 200 stores. It did not specify how long the closures would last.
The company told Reuters it was beginning to board up its Lake Street store in Minneapolis, near where Floyd was killed, for safety and to begin recovery efforts. The company said in a statement that it would plan to reopen the store late this year. 
""There is certainly potential for the resulting social unrest to hurt certain businesses like retailers and restaurants, and for it to further dent consumer and business sentiment,"" said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling. ""It is even possible, particularly if the unrest continues and spreads, that it would, all other things being equal, have a significant impact on investor psychology and the markets.""  
Walmart closed some stores in Minneapolis and Atlanta after protests Friday, and closed several hundred stores at 5 p.m. on Sunday, a spokesman said. ""We’ll look at them each day, and at how each community is impacted and make decisions then,"" the spokesman said.
Online retailer Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) said it was monitoring the situation closely. ""In a handful of cities we’ve adjusted routes or scaled back typical delivery operations to ensure the safety of our teams,"" the company said in an emailed statement. 

U.S. retail sales have posted record declines as the novel coronavirus pandemic kept Americans at home, putting the economy on track for its biggest contraction in the second quarter since the Great Depression in the 1930s.

PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - Panama's Maritime Authority said it will impose sanctions on vessels, including fines of up to $10,000 and withdrawing its flag from the ship, if they deliberately deactivate, tamper or alter the operation of their tracking transponders.
""This General Directorate of Merchant Marine will impose sanctions to all those Panamanian flagged vessels that deliberately deactivate, tamper or alter the operation of Long Range Identification and Tracking System or the Automatic Identification System,"" it said in a statement.
The head of Panama's Merchant Marine, Rafael Cigarruista, told Reuters the decision to sanction ships that do not comply with the rules are part of commitments made by Panama to avoid sanctions from international organizations.
""We want our ships to not deliberately turn off their equipment,"" said Cigarruista.
Panama has the largest shipping fleet in the world with some 8,000 vessels registered.
The Panama Maritime Authority said it is constantly monitoring its fleet and it will initiate an internal investigation if it detects a vessel's transponder is down or not reporting.
That investigation ""may culminate with sanctions that will be deemed appropriate (and) in some cases where the vessel is found having this conduct on regular bases could be de-flagged or deleted from the registry.""
The Trump administration on May 14 Thursday issued guidelines to help ship owners and insurers avoid the risks of sanctions penalties, standards that were modified following months of discussions with industry.
The guidelines, known as a Global Maritime Advisory, concern sanctions on Iran, North Korea and Syria. The State Department said it is committed to disrupting sanctions evasion and smuggling of goods, including oil exports from Iran, which the Trump administration imposed sanctions on soon after pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.
The maritime advisory was first outlined on March 9 by David Peyman, a State Department deputy assistant secretary. He said then the advisory would, among other things, warn shippers not to turn off transponders and to not store Iranian oil.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Ministry of Economics has proposed a 5 billion euro ($5.6 billion) buyer bonus scheme as part of an impending stimulus package in an effort to boost car sales, two people close to the matter said on Sunday. 
Global car sales have slumped as production lines and showrooms shut in response to the coronavirus pandemic. A business sentiment survey by the Ifo institute this month showed the German auto sector at its lowest ebb since 1991.
The heads of the co-governing Social Democrats (SPD) and Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) are expected to present the overall stimulus package on Tuesday, which could total up to 80 billion euros, according to one media report.
The economy ministry's proposal is for purchase premiums to be paid to buyers of electric vehicles and conventionally powered cars worth less than 77,350 euros each, with the scheme expiring at the end of the year, the sources said.
The ministry declined to comment. 
The proposal still has significant hurdles to clear.
SPD head Norbert Walter-Borjans told Reuters that he was in favour of supporting the auto industry but that incentivising purchases of conventional combustion engines was the wrong path.
""If the state subsidises (new cars), then that must go along with a change toward alternative engines. If discounts, then that must be for electric cars"", Walter-Borjans said. 
The economy ministry's plans foresee a basic premium of 2,500 euros per car, which would be topped up by 500 euros for fuel-efficient vehicles. Existing incentive programmes would be increased by 1,500 euros for electric cars and 750 euros for hybrids.

A slew of policymakers and industry groups have spoken out against premiums for car purchases, arguing that the stimulus programme should adhere to climate-change policies and not favour a single industry.

1664,By Investing.com,"<span>May 31, 2020 06:56AM ET</span>",Economic Calendar - Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,"By Noreen Burke 
Investing.com - Heightened tensions between the U.S. and China will mean that risk sentiment remains fragile this week, while the highlight of the economic calendar will be Friday's May non-farm payrolls report. Ahead of that, investors will have the chance to parse other economic data, including initial jobless claims and factory orders. The European Central Bank is widely expected to top-up its emergency asset purchasing program and the UK and European Union are to hold another round of virtual Brexit talks. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
Friday's U.S. jobs report is expected to show that the unemployment rate rose to 19.7% last month with employers forecast to have cut 8.25 million jobs, compared with the record 20.5 million jobs lost in April.
While some encouraging signs in the employment picture have emerged in recent weeks as some workers rejoin jobs with businesses starting to reopen in the second half of the month, these changes are unlikely to be reflected in the May data.
Any positive surprise, however, is likely to be cheered by stock market bulls eager to grasp at signs of a rebound from the coronavirus induced economic slump.
While Federal Reserve officials are now in the traditional blackout period ahead of their next policy meeting in June the calendar this week features ISM manufacturing data Monday, Thursday’s jobless claims report and reports on factory orders and private sector hiring.
In the euro zone investors will be looking at figures on German factory orders for April while the UK calendar has the final manufacturing PMI on Monday and then the final services PMI on Wednesday.
The standoff between the worlds two largest economies over Beijing’s new security legislation for Hong Kong, which investors fear could erode the city's freedoms, looks set to continue this week.
U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to end Hong Kong's special status if Beijing imposes new national security laws on the on the Asian financial center, but China's state media has pushed back, saying this would hurt the United States more than China.
Whether Trump goes so far as to scrap his Phase 1 trade deal with China or merely takes some symbolic steps around sanctions and visas for Hong Kong citizens could determine how long the latest global stock market rally will last.
While on the face of it the announcement of the 750 billion euro EU plan to prop up economies hit by the coronavirus pandemic has eased some pressure on the ECB, officials are still expected to unveil fresh stimulus on Thursday.
The EU recovery fund will take time to set up and will likely face hurdles on the way and the ECB is burning through its emergency asset purchases, which will likely run dry by October - unless expanded.
The ECB is widely expected to announce a 500 billion-euro ($555 billion) increase to its Pandemic Emergence Purchase Program and extend is duration until mid-2021.
The central bank will also publish updated economic projections which could confirm President Christine Lagarde’s assessment that the bloc’s economy is in the midst of a much-deeper downturn than initially believed.
Another round of Brexit talks get underway on Tuesday ahead of the June 18-19 EU summit by which time London needs to make up its mind about asking for an extension to the transition agreement.
There's not much time left until the December 31 Brexit deadline, when the two sides will part ways - with or without a trade deal in place.
Negotiators have not made much progress and the EU has urged Britain to make a bigger effort and be more realistic about what it can achieve in talks.
The resulting uncertainty has pinned sterling close to its lowest levels in almost 30 years. And as if a potentially messy Brexit was not enough, the British currency is also battling with the prospect of negative interest rates and a prolonged recession.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition would stump up more than 60 billion euros, while the country's regional states would shoulder the rest, the paper reported.
The government was not immediately available for comment.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz from the co-governing Social Democrats (SPD) and Economy Minister Peter Altmaier from Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) are expected to present the stimulus programme next week.
The scheme could include tax cuts, cash handouts to families, additional funds for small companies, debt relief for municipalities and subsidies for the car industry, according to proposals from various policy makers.
Europe's largest economy is expected to plunge into its steepest recession since World War Two. The new fiscal stimulus package comes on top of a 750 billion-euro rescue package agreed in March.
Wolfgang Schaeuble, president of the German parliament, on Sunday called for the stimulus plan to focus on climate policy, digitization and innovation.
""It is crucial not just to announce large sums of money, but to do the right thing"", he told Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung (FAS).
""Some people think that climate policy must now take a back seat. But that cannot be seriously advocated,"" he said, adding that cash incentives for new cars would be ""unimaginative"".
He echoed comments from some industry groups which have spoken out against bonuses for new cars, after France introduced such a scheme.
The president of the VDMA association of German engineering firms, Carl Martin Welcker, told FAS: ""Purchase premiums for cars and comparable individual subsidies discriminate against other products and generate windfall profits.""

Egypt suspended international flights in March and shut down restaurants, hotels and cafes in order to combat the pandemic. Although airports remain closed to all but domestic and repatriation flights, hotels were recently allowed to reopen at a quarter of their usual capacity if they met strict health and safety protocols. 
Around 78 hotels, mostly along the Red Sea coast, met these rules and are currently operating with an occupancy rate of 20%-22%, said the ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. An additional 173 hotels across the country have applied for a licence to reopen and will be considered in the coming week, he added. 
The government said it aimed to increase the permitted occupancy rate of hotels to 50% in June. Tourism is one of the country's main sources of foreign currency and accounts for 5% of GDP. 

Egypt has so far registered 23,449 cases of the new coronavirus including 913 deaths. Some of the first cases registered in the country were of foreign nationals.

Finance minister Rishi Sunak declined on Friday to say whether he would bring forward his next budget statement, due in the autumn, to spell out how he will tackle Britain's surging debt. 
But Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government was elected in December after promising to upgrade the country's creaking infrastructure and the FT said this would form a central part of its recovery programme, along with the retraining of workers. 
""We are trying to identify shovel-ready projects — we want to get a move on with this,"" it quoted one minister as saying.
Sunak said on Friday that employers hammered by the coronavirus shutdown would have to gradually start contributing to the government's hugely expensive wage subsidy scheme, but only from August.
The government has been paying since March 80% of the wages of workers who are temporarily laid off, and who now total 8.4 million, to limit a surge in unemployment.
While that has been warmly welcomed by unions and business groups there are still fears that many jobs will go in sectors which will struggle to reopen, such as hospitality, retail and aviation.

The details on holdings in the Fed's Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, one of nearly a dozen emergency programs the Fed has rolled out since March to respond to the coronavirus crisis, were published Friday.
The Fed's largest investment-grade fund holding - iShares iBoxx US Dollar Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (P:LQD) - contains 30 Apple bonds giving the Fed about $5.7 million of exposure to the maker of iPhones through that ETF alone as of May 19. Apple is also a holding in other ETFs the Fed bought.
The largest of the facility's junk bond fund holdings - iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (P:HYG) - gives the Fed around $25,000 of exposure to three companies that have filed for bankruptcy since the health crisis erupted, including $14,000 to car rental company Hertz, $10,000 to retailer JC Penney (NYSE:JCP), and $1,500 to department store operator Neiman Marcus.
All told the Fed made 158 purchases of shares in 15 exchange-traded funds from May 12 and May 18, the data showed.
Until the health crisis, the Fed had bought U.S. Treasuries and government-backed bonds. The SMCCF's purchases of bond ETFs represent entirely new territory.
LQD, the third largest U.S. taxable bond ETF, holds bonds from such banks as Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), as well as telecom operators AT&T Inc (N:T) and  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ). The fund was the Fed facility's largest holding, at $326.3 million.
The SMCCF also bought shares in six of the seven largest ETFs devoted to high-yield - or junk - bonds, accounting for $223.4 million, of 17% of its overall portfolio.
The Fed's investment in HYG was just over $100 million.

Speaking at a White House briefing to unveil measures targeting Beijing over Hong Kong, Trump said he is instructing the presidential working group on financial markets to study ""differing practices of Chinese companies listed on U.S. markets with the goal of protecting American investors,"" Trump said.
""Investment firms should not be subjecting their clients to the hidden and undue risks associated with financing Chinese companies that do not play by the same rules,"" he said, adding that Americans are entitled to ""fairness and transparencies."" 
Members of the working group include Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams (NYSE:WMB), Securities and Exchange Chairman Jay Clayton and other regulatory officials.
The move comes as the U.S. government has begun extending its trade and technology battle with Beijing to capital markets, as ties between the rival nations have soured over the origins of the deadly coronavirus. 
Earlier this month, an independent board tasked with administering federal worker and military pension funds halted plans to allow one of its funds to track an index that includes controversial Chinese companies, under pressure from the White House. 
The U.S. Senate also passed legislation in May that could prevent some Chinese companies from listing their shares on U.S. exchanges unless they follow standards for U.S. audits and regulations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday said a potential surge in U.S. coronavirus infections could derail the recovery from the deep downturn triggered by the pandemic, even as he reiterated the central bank's vow to keep fighting the crisis.
The Fed has gone all out to steady financial markets since March, lowering borrowing costs and creating credit backstops for companies and local governments reeling from the economic fallout of lockdowns to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
More than 101,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, and many health officials are worried that infections could spike in the weeks and months ahead as states reopen their economies. 
""I think a second wave would really undermine public confidence and might make for a significantly longer recovery and weaker recovery,"" Powell said in a webcast with Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economics professor and former Fed vice chair. 
Powell, a graduate of Princeton, spoke a few hours before his youngest daughter was to graduate from the Ivy League college. 
""We of course would continue to react,"" Powell said. ""We are not close to any limits that we might have, I would say ... but I would worry almost more that a second outbreak would undermine confidence."" 
The remarks were a somber reminder that the trajectory of the crisis facing the Fed is a function of the public's health, a factor over which the world's most powerful central bank has no control. 
The U.S. central bank has announced 11 programs to cushion the effects of the economic cratering, and all but two have come on line. The Fed is ""days away from making our first loans"" under the ""Main Street Lending Program"" to medium-sized companies, Powell said on Friday, and weeks from opening a lending program for states, counties and large cities. 
Investors are now thirsty for clues about when the Fed may restart large-scale bond-buying and firm up promises about how long the purchases might continue. Powell's remarks, his last public ones before the Fed's June 9-10 policy meeting, did little to slake that thirst.
Asked about limits to the Fed's crisis toolkit, for instance, Powell said there were few, noting that in fighting ""an emergency of a nature we haven't really seen before ... we crossed a lot of red lines that had not been crossed before, and I am very comfortable that this is that situation where you do that.""
The Fed's lending programs are backstopped by the U.S. Treasury under rules reserved for emergencies. And in an effort to stabilize financial markets, the Fed has ballooned its balance sheet, which it had been trimming before the coronavirus pandemic, to a record-setting level of more than $7 trillion. It may need to do more before the crisis is over, to keep borrowing rates low even as the economic recovery takes hold.
STAYING THE COURSE
Powell has repeatedly promised to keep monetary policy loose until the recovery is well on its way and the U.S. unemployment rate - widely expected to surpass 20% in the second quarter - has returned to healthy levels. 
Global investors have been doing the Fed's work so far, bidding down U.S. Treasury yields to record-low levels - the yield on the benchmark 10-year note has been below 1.0% since late March. 
But between a possible economic rebound and the trillions in extra debt the Treasury is in the midst of issuing to help pay for the economic rescue, pressure may build in the other direction, and market analysts are pushing for guidance. 
Powell offered none on Friday, though he suggested the Fed would stay the course for now. 

""Of course our balance sheet can't go to infinity,"" he said. ""I would say that I am comfortable with where we are now and the path we are on, and don't see risks based on what we're doing right now to inflation or to financial stability.""

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Analyst expectations for Colombia's inflation in 2020 fell below the targeted figure for the first time in six years, due to lower demand as the coronavirus pandemic chokes the economy, according to a survey by Reuters. 
According to the median of those surveyed, inflation will rise 2.74% this year, below the 3.4% estimated in a survey in April and under the central bank's 3% target. 
If inflation falls in line with the survey, it will represent the lowest level of annual inflation since 2013 and the second-lowest for more than 65 years. 
""Our estimate is in response to bearish factors such as weak demand, which has led to a re-adjustment of consumer spending geared towards essential goods, leaving behind items such as entertainment or durable goods,"" said Banco de Bogota analyst Gustavo Acero.
""The relative stability in some public services and in rents also supports the downward bias in our inflation expectations for the end of the year,"" he added.
In May alone, Latin America's fourth-largest economy is expected to report inflation of 0.09%, which would drop the 12-month figure to 3.28%, down from the 3.51% reported in April.
Inflation expectations for 2021 were held in line with last month's survey at 3%.
Falling inflation would continue to play to the favor of the central bank's plan to further cut the benchmark interest rate - currently at 3.25% - in a move to alleviate financial costs of as the economy collapses.

(Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday said central bank officials are open to expanding the Main Street Lending Program, which is days away from issuing its first loans, to businesses that may not currently qualify but need assistance to avoid shedding workers. 
Fed staffers also reminded businesses interested in applying for the upcoming Main Street lending facility that they can seek financing even if they have already received some other types of loan assistance.
The Main Street Lending Program is targeting medium-sized and small-sized businesses facing financial strain because of the coronavirus pandemic. The program is open to businesses with 15,000 or fewer employees and with revenue of $5 billion or less, but Powell said the Fed could adjust those parameters.
""I can imagine us expanding on either end too,"" Powell said during an interview webcast on Friday. ""We are looking back at companies that were in good, solid financial shape before the pandemic, we’re trying to find those companies and we’re trying to create credit products that work for them."" 
Businesses that received economic injury disaster loans or loans from the Paycheck Protection Program, which offers forgivable loans to companies with fewer than 500 employees, can still apply for loans in the Main Street program, Fed staffers explained in a webinar for borrowers interested in the Main Street program.
However, borrowers cannot participate in the Main Street facility if they are taking part in the Fed's primary market corporate credit facility, which will purchase corporate debt from eligible issuers. 
The Main Street program is currently not open to nonprofit organizations, but Fed staffers said they are working with the Treasury Department to evaluate the ""feasibility"" of adjusting the program criteria to include the group. 
The Fed has not disclosed a specific launch date for the program.

BUENOS AIRES/LONDON (Reuters) - Argentine bonds jumped on Friday after the government and key bondholders exchanged new proposals to revamp around $65 billion in debt that edged the two sides closer together and bolstered hopes that a deal can be stuck eventually.
Buenos Aires unveiled an amended proposal on Thursday with slightly earlier maturities and a shorter two-year grace period on coupon payments. Earlier, it had knocked back a new counter-offer from two key creditor groups.
The Ad Hoc Bondholder Group including AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB), BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Ashmore and others gave more details about its joint offer on Friday, which it said involved a 32% cut in interest payments, taking the average coupon rate to 4.25%.
The South American country's economy minister said the new proposal from bondholders was a step in the ""right direction,"" but fell short of what the country needed to dig itself out from its debt crisis during a lengthy recession.
""More work is still needed yet the two sides are getting ever closer,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note. It calculated the net present value (NPV) of Argentina's new offer to be around 41.5 cents on the dollar, up from 33 cents in the original offer.
""An NPV of 41.5 is a decent improvement and gets much closer to the 45-50 area where we think that a deal can be reached,"" the investment bank said, adding one could be struck in the third quarter with ""further goodwill on both sides"".
Citi said the shorter grace period and smaller principal haircut meant the government's new offer was around 5-7 points better than the initial one made in April, while a new bond to compensate for accrued coupons added value.
Argentina's over-the-counter bonds , mostly trading between 30-40 cents on the dollar after a sharp fall last year, rose an average 3.3% on Friday, while a country risk index fell.

Argentina is locked in talks to revamp a foreign debt pile that has become unsustainable. The major grains producer last week failed to make around $500 million of bond payments, its ninth sovereign default.
The government has extended a deadline for talks to June 2, though people close to the negotiations say the cut-off could be pushed back further.
Siobhan Morden at Amherst Pierpont said in a note on Friday that the extended deadlines and improved offer suggested a compromise could be found.

""There is still no official breakthrough between Argentina and bondholders; however there is latent optimism of reaching a compromise under the moderate influence of President (Alberto) Fernandez,"" she wrote.

In August, companies will only have to make pension and social security payments for the workers they have temporarily laid off while the government will continue to pay 80% of their wages.

Employers would then be asked to pay 10% of the wage costs in September and 20% in October, reducing some of the huge burden on the public finances but a lighter requirement than reported by media before the announcement.

“We crossed a lot of red lines that had not been crossed before,” Powell said Friday during an online event hosted by Princeton University’s Griswold Center for Economic Policy Studies. “I’m very confident that this is the situation where you do that and then you figure it out.”
Powell’s remarks will probably be the last from a Fed policy maker before officials enter a blackout period at midnight Friday leading up to the June 9-10 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Officials are widely expected to leave interest rates just above zero at that gathering and re-commit to using their full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Main Street
The Fed chair responded to questions about one of its most complex and riskiest programs intended to support the economy -- the Main Street facility -- which has been slow to launch. Powell said the central bank is “days away” from getting it up and running. The loan program is designed to help small and medium-sized businesses that don’t have access to public markets, he said.
“We do have this precious grant of independence,” Powell told session moderator Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chair. “That really means that we need to stay in our lane and just do those things that Congress assigns us to do.”
Powell and his colleagues have warned the pandemic may leave deep and lasting scars on the economy even as the U.S. and other countries begin to emerge from lock-downs designed to limit the contagion.
More than 40 million U.S. workers have filed for unemployment benefits in the past 2-1/2 months as businesses shuttered and Americans stayed home. Data released earlier on Friday showed U.S. consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the world’s largest economy, plunged in April by the most on record.

1680,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 29, 2020 10:36AM ET</span>","Trump Action Aside, China Crop-Buying Goal Is Becoming Untenable","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump is preparing to announce actions on China. Whether or not that affects his phase-one trade deal, one thing is already clear: the target for agricultural purchases is becoming untenable.
China bought just $3.35 billion in American agricultural products in the first three months of the year, the lowest for that period since 2007, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That’s a fraction of the $36.5 billion it promised for 2020 under the partial trade deal reached in January.
The spread of the novel coronavirus has put China well behind the necessary pace to meet its phase one pledges. And while purchases of everything from pork to soybeans have picked up in the past two months, it’s “highly unlikely” the nation will reach the target given low commodity prices, according to Rabobank, one of the largest lenders to the agriculture industry.
“The commitments are not in volume, they’re in dollar value,” Stephen Nicholson, a senior analyst for grains and oilseeds at the Dutch bank, said in a telephone interview. “When commodities are so cheap, you can buy a lot and not get close to that number. That’s the concern.”
Trump said he will announce new policies on China Friday. The president wasn’t specific, but he was responding to a question about whether the U.S. would remain in the “phase one” deal. Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said earlier that the deal remains in place for the moment but added that China’s moves on Hong Kong were “a very, very big mistake.”
Tensions between the U.S. and China have been escalating recently, with Trump blaming the Asian nation for misleading the world about the scale and risk of the coronavirus outbreak. On Wednesday, the U.S. said it could no longer certify Hong Kong’s political autonomy from China, sparking fears of trade disruptions.
Since the coronavirus shut down China and disrupted imports, traders have speculated the Asian nation, the top consumer of pork and soybeans, would invoke a clause that could potentially allow it to renegotiate the trade deal. That hasn’t happened and despite the worsening rhetoric on the U.S. side, China has made progress in its purchases recently.
“I think China will ignore the rhetoric to a point but will respond to any actions or sanctions against China’s interest,” said Dan Kowalski, vice president of research at CoBank, a $145 billion lender to the agriculture industry. “I’m encouraged by the direction and the momentum they have brought into this in the last couple of months.”
Slow Chinese buying in the U.S. also has been helped by a weaker currency in rival Brazil, which has made the nation’s commodities more attractive. China tends to buy where it’s cheaper and the deal acknowledges purchases will be made at market prices.
“China has offered the import opportunities and if market conditions are good, China can import more,” Cheng Guoqiang, a China farm trade expert and a professor at the School of Economics and Management of Tongji University, told a conference this month. “You can not ask commercial soy plants to increase imports of U.S. soybean that are 10% or 20% more expensive than Brazilian soybeans.”
There’s also the issue of data. While USDA figures show sales of $3.35 billion in the first quarter, Chinese customs data indicate $5.1 billion, according to Bloomberg calculations. For April, Chinese data point to another $1.25 billion while the U.S. still hasn’t made its figures available.
China usually loads up on American agricultural commodities in the first and fourth quarters. With the U.S. figure being so low in the first three months of the year, that will probably leave more than $20 billion to be picked up from October to December, Rabobank’s Nicholson said. There’s also concern the nations may decide to tear up the deal.
“Will they go and tear ‘phase one’ up? Maybe. Will it be renegotiated? Maybe. Who knows what could happen,” Nicholson said. “I think the talks will continue, because it’s mutually beneficial.”

1681,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>",Take Five: Hong Kong takes center stage,"LONDON (Reuters) - 1/ TESTY RELATIONS
China just concluded its closed-door annual meeting of parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), with top officials making clear that employment is the top priority.
Fiscal stimulus worth more than 4% of GDP has been commissioned, primarily to boost jobs and incomes, but not at the expense of financial stability. Markets might want to keep one eye on the employment indicators coming out of manufacturing surveys due in coming days. Money markets are tight, the yuan is weakening. Markets are heading into June wondering if China will cut bank reserves or let the currency slip further. 
But the elephant in the room is the standoff between Washington and China over Beijing’s new security legislation for Hong Kong, which many lawyers, diplomats and investors fear could erode the city's freedoms.
The weekend is packed with action: Hong Kong braces for more street protests, the U.S. administration reviews the city's special status and President Donald Trump preps a response. Whether he goes so far as to scupper his 2019 Phase 1 trade deal with China or merely takes some symbolic steps around sanctions and visas for Hong Kong citizens could determine how long the latest global stock market rally will last.

2/JOBS, MAIN STREET, WALL STREET 
The growing divergence between an increasingly dire economic landscape and a roaring U.S. stock market will be on display on Friday when May non-farm payroll employment data is reported.
The rise in weekly jobless claims since the April survey week points to another grim payroll figure for May. A Reuters poll showed economists expect U.S. employers to have cut 7.45 million jobs in May, compared with the record 20.5 million jobs lost in April. 
While some encouraging signs in the employment picture have emerged in recent weeks as some workers rejoin jobs with businesses starting to reopen, these changes are unlikely to be reflected in the May data.
Any positive surprise, however, is likely to be cheered by stock market bulls eager to grasp at signs of a rebound from the coronavirus induced economic slump.

3/WHY WAIT, CHRISTINE?
On the surface, the 750 billion euro European Union plan to prop up economies hammered by the coronavirus pandemic eases pressure on the European Central Bank which has long urged Europe's leaders to do more to strengthen the bloc's economy.
So, ECB rate setters meeting on Thursday could well hold back until the EU deal is done, right? Well no, argue many economists, who believe fresh stimulus in June is more likely than not. After all, the EU recovery fund will take time to set up and will likely face hurdles on the way, they say. 
In addition, the ECB is burning through its emergency asset purchases, which will likely run dry by October - unless expanded. And the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 shock means the economic outlook remains far from certain.
Fresh ECB stimulus would likely fuel gains in southern European bonds and the euro, basking at two-month highs on the recovery fund optimism. If further ECB stimulus is matter of when not if, the key question for the ECB is, why wait?

4/DIAL #1 FOR CASH
May has been remarkable for big ticket capital raises by companies, institutional investors and shareowners with several billion dollars being raised to tackle the fallout from the virus-hit, bringing life back into equity capital markets. 
In Europe, a bumper virtual coffee IPO of coffee maker JDE Peet's (AS:JDEP) is the icing on the cake. 
Hard hit by coronavirus lockdowns, companies raised money in equity and bond markets to help them weather the crisis and smoothly restart their businesses as restrictions ease. Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY),  Whitbread  (LON:WTB) and Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) were big names in Europe. In the United States, PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) Services' selldown of its BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) stake and Sanofi (PA:SASY) exiting Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) sparked a flood of deals. 
The rush for cash also put the spotlight back on convertibles - selling bonds that can convert into stocks. Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said it may sell 3-billion-euro worth contingent convertible bond.
That search of money has been more visible in the U.S. than Europe, though the levels of issuance has been well-below levels seen in the wale of the 2008 financial crisis. Meanwhile rising equity supply and falling buybacks may restrain the stock market rally, some analysts say.

5/ NOT SO STERLING 
Britain heads into another round of Brexit talks ahead of the June 18-19 European Union summit by which time London needs to make up its mind about asking for an extension to the transition agreement. 
British officials have repeatedly said they won't do so, but the clock is ticking and there's not much time left until the end of December when Britain and the EU part ways - with or without a trade deal. 
Negotiators have not made much progress. Britain says an agreement on fisheries might not be ready by July and it is down to Brussels to break a fundamental impasse. The EU urges Britain to make a bigger effort and be more realistic about what it can achieve in these talks. 
All this toing and froing keeps the pound close to its lowest in nearly three decades. And as if a potentially messy Brexit was not enough, the British currency is also grappling with the prospect of negative interest rates, a deep recession and a growing pile of debt.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester said U.S. economic activity could pick up in the third quarter as businesses begin to reopen, but she cautioned the recovery is likely to be slow as consumers and businesses take precautions to limit coronavirus infections. 
""The recovery could be slow,"" Mester said Friday during an interview with Bloomberg TV. ""When we have so many people out of work it's hard to imagine that we see a quick V-shaped recovery.""
Mester said activity could begin to emerge in the third quarter as the economy begins to reopen, but she said output and employment are not likely to return to levels seen at the start of the year. 
Fed officials moved quickly to stabilize markets and support the economy as the coronavirus spread, leading businesses to shut down across the country. The U.S. central bank cut rates to zero, launched a slew of emergency lending facilities and kicked off open-ended asset purchases to improve market functioning. 
Policymakers are expected to release their updated economic forecasts when they meet again on June 9 and 10 to discuss monetary policy. 
Asked about yield curve control, where the central bank targets borrowing costs across different maturities, Mester said it could serve as a support to forward guidance, if the Fed were to use it. But she said she doesn’t view it as a tool for the Fed to use during this ""phase,"" where officials are more concerned with market functioning. 
""You would have to think hard about how you would implement it,"" Mester said.

BENGARULU (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada will hold interest rates at a record low of 0.25% until at least the end of next year as the economy reels from the coronavirus crisis, according to nearly every economist polled by Reuters.
Canadian provinces have started to slowly reopen after the coronavirus pandemic - which has infected about 88,000 people in Canada so far and killed nearly 7,000 - led to a near-halt in economic activity, likely dragging the country into its deepest recession on record.
All but one of 24 economists polled May 26-28 who provided forecasts through to the end of 2021 had the central bank holding its overnight rate at 0.25%, following a cumulative 150 basis points of cuts since the start of the outbreak.
""It will still be a few months before it becomes clear how the economy and housing market is coping, but the downside risks suggest that the bias is still likely to be toward further policy support,"" said Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics.
Most economists expect the BoC - which launched a quantitative easing program in March, buying up to C$10 billion of corporate bonds and C$50 billion of provincial bonds to support the economy - to expand its asset purchases further. 
But when asked to estimate the size of the central bank's balance sheet by end-year, which many economists are forecasting for the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, only two were ready to provide a number, both saying $650 billion. 
BoC Governor Stephen Poloz, who will be succeeded by Tiff Macklem on June 3, said recently the damage done by the global pandemic might not be as bad as some fear and talk about it was ""a little too dire.""
Economists were evenly split when asked about his recent comments, with seven saying they were ""too optimistic"" and seven saying ""about right."" No respondent said his remarks were too pessimistic.
The economy will contract a staggering 37.5% on an annualized basis this quarter, according to a separate Reuters poll.[ECILT/CA]
""Policymakers and financial markets are too optimistic that the current crisis is only a supply side shock, allowing the economy to bounce back once restrictions are lifted,"" said Brendan LaCerda, senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics.

""The deterioration in the labor market is much more permanent, begetting a long slow recovery.""

Stefaan de Rynck said he did not expect a breakthrough at the talks next week. 
""I'm not so optimistic about Round 4, hopefully we make some progress, it won't be a breakthrough,"" he told an Institute For Government event. ""We will have to negotiate over the summer. It will have to happen at an accelerated pace."" 
The United Kingdom left the EU on Jan. 31 but the main terms of its membership remain in place during a transition period until the end of this year, allowing it time to negotiate a new free trade deal with the bloc. 
Both sides have said they remain far apart on many issues and they traded barbs earlier this month over the talks. 
De Rynck said while Britain had always taken a combative approach, relations had remained cordial and the Europeans were perplexed by a letter from the British negotiator that accused the EU of offering a ""relatively low quality"" trade agreement. 
Britain has said the bloc needs to break the impasse and de Rynck said any agreement needed to be struck soon to avoid the disruption that would come with a no-deal departure, or a late agreement. 
""You look at a situation where we agree the future in September, October, November but with very little time to prepare,"" he said. ""And in which case I would still expect quite a bit of disruption on the first of January."" 

He added the EU remained open to an extension and both sides should work at all costs to avoid a disorderly exit.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian central bank will continue cutting interest rates in 2020, as it faces a worsening economic contraction and lower inflationary risks, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
Economic activity in Russia has been pummeled since late March by lockdowns across the country designed to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The consensus forecasts of 21 analysts and economists suggested gross domestic product will contract 3.8% in 2020 before growing 3% in 2021.
A month ago, when official data was yet to reflect the impact of the lockdowns, a similar poll showed the economy would shrink by 3.4% this year.
The biggest contraction, 9.1%, is expected in the second quarter, followed by a 4.9% drop in the third, 3.6% in the fourth and 2.1% in the first quarter of 2021.
""The peak of the pandemic in Russia has passed, but the post-pandemic future holds many challenges. The government's ability to shield the economy and population remains the key swing factor in shoring up the future,"" BCS Brokerage said.
In April, the first full month of the lockdown, the economy shrank by 12% on-year, cementing expectations that the central bank will cut rates next month.
The central bank is expected to lower its key rate to 5% in June, delivering a 50-basis-point cut that is smaller than a 100-basis-point step the central bank pledged to consider, the poll showed.
""The CBR will resist the temptation to cut the policy rate prior to the scheduled meeting on 19 June and pay more attention to transmission of the recent steps into market rates and utilization of the subsidized lending,"" said Artem Zaigrin, chief economist at Sova Capital brokerage.
In the third quarter, the central bank is seen slashing the key rate to 4.5%, where it will hold it into the middle of 2021. Forecasts for the end-2020 reading varied between 3.5% and 5%.
The previous monthly poll foresaw the rate at 4.75% in the third quarter and 4.5% by year-end.
Inflation, which the central bank targets at 4%, is now seen finishing this year at 4.2%, down from 4.5% in the late-April poll.
Most of the forecasts in the Reuters poll were based on at least 10 individual projections.
The rouble outlook against the U.S. dollar was largely unchanged. The rouble was expected to trade at 70 to the dollar and 75.80 to the euro 12 months from now. The previous poll foresaw exchange rates of 69 and 77.97, respectively.

On Friday, the rouble's official exchange rates, set by the central bank, were 71.10 per dollar and 78.26 per euro.

CAUDAN, France (Reuters) - Giovanni Pili, a worker at a  Renault  (PA:RENA) factory in France, was on Friday savoring the fact that he was not laid off in a global shakeup at the carmaker, and trying not to think too much about the uncertain future facing his plant, and his industry.
Pili and colleagues at his factory in Caudan, north-west France, have been on strike all this week and protesting at the factory gates, anticipating their plant would be shuttered.
Renault instead announced the plant - and its 385 full-time workers who operate forges making manifolds and exhaust bends - would be put under strategic review while managers try to find new customers for the components they produce.
""It's a reprieve,"" said Maël Le Goff, representative at the factory of the CGT trade union. ""The hardest part is still to come.""
Pili, a 44-year-old father of two who has worked at the plant for 20 years, received the news outside a local government office, where Renault managers were briefing union representatives. Le Goff came out of the meeting and climbed onto a railing to announce the plan to the crowd of workers.
Pili's first reaction was one of relief.
The factory was his first proper job. He was hired straight out of compulsory military service, and moved to Caudan from his home in Ardennes in eastern France. His then-girlfriend, now his wife, agreed to move with him.
His family put down roots, and he built a career in the factory's foundry. He survived a round of job cuts in 2009, then helped rebuild after a fire in 2019. Many of his co-workers were father and son, because it was commonplace for generations of families to work at the factory. 
""It's a part of our life,"" he said of the factory.
He built a comfortable life. He bought a handsome converted farm house. The property has an outside terrace, a sit-on lawnmower, and a large collapsible swimming pool. Pili drives a white Renault van. His wife's parents moved to live nearby.
Speaking the day before the announcement, he said if he was laid off, he worried about how he would pay off his mortgage, and the loan on his car, with just his wife's salary from her job as a dental assistant. 
But he also did not want to move away to use his skills in a car factory elsewhere in France, because he had no faith that plant would stay open either.
After digesting the announcement about the factory on Friday, Pili said his plan was to get back to work on Tuesday, and try to make the plant commercially viable again.

""We're enjoying the announcement that was made this morning, and we're not thinking about what comes later,"" he said. ""We'll see how things evolve.""

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine is expecting the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to approve a $5 billion loan package on June 5 and to disburse the first tranche of $1.9 billion the next day, Prime Minister Denys Shmygal told Reuters on Friday. 
Ukraine has said it risked defaulting without the money, which Shmygal said he expected to be approved at an IMF board meeting, and Kiev struggled for months to pass the reforms the fund was asking for amid concerns over corruption and influence-peddling.
Its precarious financial position and horse-trading over reform comes at a time when President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is trying to negotiate with Russia, which annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 and backed a pro-Russian uprising in eastern Ukraine.
The IMF declined to comment on Shmygal's statement, which offers the most precise timing the government has yet given for when it expects the disbursement of the IMF loan tranches, money the government sorely needs to weather an economic shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The second tranche, worth $1.6 billion, is expected from September onwards and the third tranche, of $1.5 billion, would come next year, Shmygal said. 
Shmygal also disclosed a preliminary estimate for economic growth in the second quarter of this year, saying gross domestic product could fall by 12%. 
The government has previously said the economy would shrink by nearly 5% for the full year. It expects the second quarter to be the worst affected. 
The prime minister also said that the government would not restrict wheat exports for the next two months, even though the quota the government previously agreed with traders has been exhausted. 
The sharp economic downtown caused by the coronavirus pandemic had also focused attention on Ukraine's ability to service its debts this year. 
Shmygal said the government had repaid a $1 billion Eurobond this week, which he said ""shows that we can and are able to service external and internal debt absolutely calmly."" 
""The support of our creditor partners is necessary for Ukraine for economic development,"" he said.

President Donald Trump is set to announce new policy measures vis-à-vis China at the end of a week when relations between the world’s two biggest economies have badly strained.
Trump will hold a press briefing later on measures that are on the face of it a retaliation against Beijing for effectively suspending the autonomy of Hong Kong and allegedly mistreating its Muslim minority in the western state of Xinjiang.
Trump may announce the end of, or changes to, Hong Kong’s trading privileges with the U.S., given that the U.S. has tied these privileges to Beijing’s observation of its promise to abide by the “one country, two systems” arrangement after retaking control of the former British colony in 1997.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng index fell another 0.7%, but the offshore yuan firmed slightly.
2. Powell to speak after another data dump
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell takes the microphone again at 11 AM ET, and may give his two cents’ worth on another stubbornly initial jobless claims number on Thursday.
The market preferred to focus on the drop in continuing claims that pointed to at least a modest revival in hiring, so there’ll be a lot of focus on how much he encourages that tendency – or not.
The stream of hard data from the U.S. economy continues on Friday with the release of personal income and spending data for April at 8:30 AM ET.
There will also be a first reading for May’s University of Michigan consumer sentiment index at 10 AM ET. The Conference Board’s index earlier this week showed an underwhelming bounce from what is likely to have been the cyclical low in April.
3. Stocks set to open lower on profit-taking
U.S. stocks are set to open lower on Friday as bulls draw in their horns at the end of a strong week, wary of keeping long positions open ahead of a weekend that may contain some unpleasant political risks.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract was down 83 points or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was down 0.2% and the Nasdaq 100 Futures contract was down 0.2%.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter  (NYSE:TWTR) stock were again in focus after President Trump signed his promised executive order that aims to allow federal regulators to hold companies liable for perceived restrictions on free speech. The order, which was criticised by Facebook, Twitter and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), is likely to draw a number of legal challenges.
Also in the spotlight are Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), VMware (NYSE:VMW) and Dell (NYSE:DELL), which all posted better-than-expected results after the bell on Thursday, and Ulta Beauty  (NASDAQ:ULTA), which slumped to an unexpected loss in its latest quarter.
4. Renault, Nissan slash capacity in response to slump; VW bets on China and EVs
The global car industry is taking ever more severe measures to stay afloat. French auto giant Renault SA (PA:RENA) said on Friday it will cut nearly 15,000 jobs, of which nearly 5,000 will be in tightly regulated domestic market.
It has appeased the French government, its biggest shareholder, by freezing plans to roll out capacity expansions in cheaper locations such as Romania and Morocco.  Overall, it’s cutting capacity by some 20%.  The measures come a day after its global alliance partner Nissan Motor (OTC:NSANY) announced similar cost-cutting measures, including the closure of a large plant in Barcelona, Spain.
Elsewhere, Germany’s Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) upped its bets on China and on electric vehicles. It’s spending $1.1 billion to raise its stake in a joint venture with EV-maker JAC to 75% from 50%, and spending another $1.1 on a stake in a local battery manufacturer.
5. Oil still struggling after inventory data
Oil prices are also consolidating after two weeks of solid gains, amid concerns that the rally may have gone too far, too fast.
The shock rise in U.S. oil stocks, confirmed by government data on Thursday, have underlined how far below year-earlier levels demand still is, as well as reviving doubts about output discipline by suppliers.
A large part of the rise in inventories last week was due to imports, notably from Saudi Arabia.
By 6:30 AM, U.S. crude futures were down 3.8% at $32.42 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 2.0% at $35.02."
1689,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",Plunging crude prices drag euro zone inflation to four-year low,"BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation continued to plunge on crashing oil prices but underlying price growth held steady, a hopeful sign for European Central Bank policymakers desperately trying to stave off the threat of deflation amid the bloc's recession.
Consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell to a four-year low of 0.1% in May from 0.3% in April, well short of the ECB's target of almost 2%, as energy prices dropped by 12% on a global recession and political scuffles among top oil producers.
But a keenly watched ""core"" figure, which excludes food and energy prices, held steady at 1.1% while even narrower data, which also excludes alcohol and tobacco, remained at 0.9%. 
While all the readings are below its target, the ECB has little power to control short term price growth and instead wants to avoid low prices getting entrenched and leading to a difficult-to-break deflationary spiral. 
Some policymakers even warned that inflation could turn negative in the coming months, primarily on low energy prices, a sort of one-off that central banks normally look past.
But the ECB is still likely to provide more stimulus in June or July as the euro zone economy shrinks by a tenth this year and coronavirus-related restrictions stay in place longer than initially feared. 
The ECB is buying up to 1.1 trillion euros worth of debt this year to keep borrowing costs down but economist expect the bank to top up its quota, perhaps by 500 million euros, as government borrowing surges. 
Low inflation is also likely to prompt some soul searching at the ECB. It has undershot its target for 7 years and the current crisis suggests years of misses ahead, even as policy is already stretched to the limits. 
This has raised questions about the viability of the bank's target and the issue will take centre stake in the ECB's strategy review due to end in mid-2021.

BofA said the ""Make America Great Again"" policy pushed by U.S. President Donald Trump to boost the American economy had supported the dollar until now, and ""Make Europe Great Again"", or ""MEGA"", is now likely to help the euro. 
The European Commmission on Wednesday proposed to offer 500 billion euros in grants and 250 billion euros in loans in a recovery fund for the region's coronavirus-hit economies.
The news triggered a rally in the euro, in European equities and in southern European bonds. The euro (EUR=EBS) has now jumped 1.8% against the dollar this week to its highest levels since late March.
BofA's weekly analysis of fund flow data flagged up a $12.8 billion move into investment grade credit funds and $6.9 billion flows into high-yield credit.
Equities saw $3.8 billion in outflows while emerging markets continued to bleed cash, losing another $1.6 billion, but it was the market's smallest outflow in six weeks.

Crunching numbers to scale the impact of the virus on the world economy, BofA noted that global GDP had seen $10 trillion in losses, policy stimulus so far has totalled $18 trillion and there have been 122 interest rate cuts globally.

1692,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 04:05AM ET</span>",Explainer: How important is Hong Kong to China as a free finance hub?,"By Noah Sin
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Bankers and investors fear China's push to impose national security laws on Hong Kong threaten the city's future as an international financial centre. If it gets to that stage, Beijing's move will come at a cost for China's economy.
WHY DOES CHINA NEED HONG KONG AS IT IS?
China still has extensive capital controls and often intervenes in its financial markets and banking system. Hong Kong is one of the world's most open economies and one of the biggest channels for equity and debt financing.
The size of Hong Kong's economy may only be the equivalent of 2.7% of mainland China's, down from 18.4% in 1997 when it reverted to Chinese rule, but the territory punches above its weight due to world-class financial and legal systems.
As a gateway between China and the West, Hong Kong attracts global capital for China more efficiently than its other cities.
(GRAPHIC: HK China GDP - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopakjdwpa/HK%20China%20GDP.jpg)
HOW IS THAT CHANGING?
Under the 'one country, two systems' formula agreed as part of Britain's handover of the territory to China, Hong Kong is guaranteed liberties unavailable on the mainland such as freedom of expression and an independent judiciary.
These freedoms give Hong Kong a special international status -- for instance, it does not have to pay the U.S. tariffs currently hitting Chinese imports.
With the U.S. State Department recommending the removal of that status as it no longer deems Hong Kong sufficiently autonomous from Beijing, measures hitting trade, finance and investments among other areas could follow.
Australia, Britain, Canada, the European Union and others also have expressed concerns over the legislation.

(GRAPHIC: HK CN DCM - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwywbrpw/HK%20CN%20DCM.jpg)
WHAT IS AT STAKE?
China uses Hong Kong's currency, equity and debt markets to attract foreign funds, while international companies use Hong Kong as a launchpad to expand into the mainland.
While China has reformed its markets over the years, over 60% of foreign direct investment (FDI) into and out of China continued to be channeled through Hong Kong as of 2018, according to  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Last year, Chinese companies raised $73.8 billion via initial public offerings (IPOs), $35 billion of which was bagged in Hong Kong, according to data from Dealogic. 
Chinese businesses tapped Hong Kong's debt market for 25% of their $131.8 billion in offshore U.S. dollar funding last year, Refinitiv data shows.
Schemes linking stock exchanges in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen provide the main gateway for foreigners to buy mainland stocks. A planned opening up of Chinese capital flows only increases the importance of these channels, and ultimately, Hong Kong, Fidelity said in a post this week.
(GRAPHIC: CN banks assets HK - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkplwxalvb/CN%20banks%20assets%20HK.jpg)
(GRAPHIC: Assets in HK banks by region - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmypmogxkpr/Assets%20in%20HK%20banks%20by%20region.jpg)
Chinese banks hold more assets in Hong Kong -- $1.1 trillion in 2019 -- than lenders from any other region, according to Hong Kong Monetary Authority's data compiled by Natixis. Any squeeze on the massive financing channel risks destabilising the Chinese economy.
Among other deep linkages, Hong Kong's port continues to handle some of China's exports and imports, though it has been eclipsed by big Chinese ports in the last few decades. 
Hong Kong has also been pivotal to China's ambition to turn the yuan into a widely-used international currency, competing with the U.S. dollar and increasing its global influence.
HOW COULD IT ALL UNRAVEL?
The pandemic has prompted central banks around the world to flood markets with new liquidity. Money that would normally seek a home in Hong Kong may just choose other centres, such as Singapore, in time diminishing the city's significance.

Capital already in Hong Kong could also choose to move outside the scope of mainland legislation and escape disruptions from local social unrest and any international restrictions. Outflows so far have been limited, bankers said.

1693,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 03:30AM ET</span>",Hungary's Orban `sceptical' about EU economic rescue proposal,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Friday said he was sceptical about the European Union's planned 750 billion-euro economic stimulus plan, which he said was problematic both on the borrowing side and the distribution side.
Orban, who assumed office 10 years ago today, has often been at loggerheads with the EU, resisting supra-national policies on the grounds ""Brussels was not Moscow"", referencing Communist rule.
Orban told public radio in an interview on Friday the EU stimulus package ignited ""red lights in our heads"" because it was a deviation from the EU's normal financing method, when countries contribute the funds that are disbursed.
The European Commission introduced the plan on Wednesday, a step towards mutualised debt as a major funding tool and greater EU powers of taxation.
Major EU governments welcomed the plan.
Orban said the eurobonds would chart new territory in the course of EU integration, with EU states automatically vouching for each other's debt.
""I don't dismiss this off-hand, although my instincts keep me sceptical,"" he said. ""I propose we study it with cool composure, then decide whether we want to step on such a path, which could set Hungary's future for decades.""
He also criticised the proposed distribution of the funds, which he said favoured wealthier nations.
""This new distribution system is an absurd and perverted solution, because it gives more to the rich than the poor, then what is the point of the whole exercise? Financing the rich from the coffers of the poor is not a good idea.""

Orban added that he would open a fresh round of ""national consultation"", a mail-in survey of government questions, on the economic response to the economic crisis.

1694,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 03:05AM ET</span>","Travel disruptions, cost cutting key issues for U.S. business in China: report","BEIJING (Reuters) - Global travel disruptions are the top concern for American businesses in China, of which many are cutting compensation and bonuses amid the fallout of the COVID-19 epidemic, according to a report from a business group.
Ninety percent of the 100 or so respondents said they were affected by such disruptions, up from 77% last month, according to a monthly survey on the impact of COVID-19 by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, released Friday.
Thousands of senior executives are stranded outside China, chamber chairman Greg Gilligan said in a news release. 
""We will continue to work closely with the relevant government authorities in a bid to bring them back as soon as possible,"" he said. 
Sixty percent of companies said they were cutting costs. About half of respondents said they had or were considering cutting compensation for employees, with nearly 30% saying they were cancelling or deferring salary increases this year.
Both U.S. and European business groups are lobbying China to allow foreign workers back into the country after it shut its borders in late March to non-Chinese nationals to curb the coronavirus.
China sees imported cases from abroad as a key threat to its epidemic control.
It has only relaxed rules to allow some business travel from South Korea and Germany. Beijing has also consulted with Japan about easing border controls.

Nearly 60% of surveyed companies said they had resumed normal operations after nationwide lockdowns, although only a quarter of companies working in the resources or industrial sectors said this was the case. About half of manufacturers said their facilities are operating at normal capacity.

1695,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 02:50AM ET</span>",China's PMI to show gradual factory recovery from lockdown paralysis: Reuters poll,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity likely rose for a third straight month in May as the economy recovered from strict lockdowns implemented to contain the coronavirus outbreak, which has hammered global business activity.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI), due for release on Sunday, is forecast to rise to 51.0 in May, from 50.8 in April, according to the median forecast of 23 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity.
Recent PMIs in many other economies have plummeted to previously unimaginable lows.
The Chinese government earlier this month omitted a gross domestic product (GDP) growth target for 2020 in its yearly work report, citing uncertainties brought on by the epidemic. Hobbled by the coronavirus, China's economy shrank 6.8% in the March quarter from a year earlier, the first contraction since current quarterly records began. 
The government also announced a range of fiscal measures to bolster the economy and support jobs, equal to about 4.1% of China's GDP, according to Reuters calculations.
China's factory output rose for the first time this year in April as the economy slowly emerged from its coronavirus lockdown, although consumption remained depressed amid increased job losses.
While much of the economy has reopened, many manufacturers are struggling with reduced or cancelled overseas orders as global demand falters. China's factory prices fell at the sharpest rate in four years in April, as industrial demand weakened.
Also, while China has defied a deeper slump in exports seen across Asia in April, that trend is unlikely to last, said Sian Fenner of Oxford Economics. 
"" (W)e expect this to be temporary as global supply disruptions and a contraction in external demand will continue to weigh on all Asian economies in the near-term,"" Fenner wrote in a note. 
Chinese authorities have rolled out more support to revive the economy, and earlier this month targeted a 2020 budget deficit of at least 3.6% of GDP, above last year's 2.8%. 
The People's Bank of China (OTC:BACHY) has cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves and reduced the interest rate on lenders’ excess reserves, as well as guiding benchmark lending rates lower to reduce borrowing costs for companies and prop up the economy. 

The private-sector Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI, which analysts say focuses more on smaller export-driven firms, is expected to improve slightly in May but remain in contractionary territory, rising to 49.6 from the previous month's 49.4. That PMI is released on Monday.

1697,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 01:10AM ET</span>","With 'Main Street' in view, Fed weighs risks of job, productivity shocks","By Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve officials have talked broadly about helping households and firms through the current economic crisis and quickly unleashed trillions of dollars in cash and credit guarantees to build a ""bridge"" to the post-pandemic world.
But underlying that swift response is a debate over how to ensure the cure for the country's immediate economic problems doesn't damage future growth by keeping otherwise failing firms alive, saddling others with too much debt to thrive, or encouraging people to stay in jobs that will disappear.
It's a longer-term dilemma, to be sure, when the priority is to prevent a wave of personal and business bankruptcies from creating an even deeper economic hole. But it is one the world's central banks and elected leaders are struggling to get right even as they roll out unprecedented support. A misstep could damage productivity and slow the hoped-for recovery. 
""It is a very tricky balance,"" Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said in a recent interview where he sketched out the paradox U.S. officials face in lowering an unemployment rate that likely topped 20% this month: Federal programs, based on hopes of a short downturn and sharp rebound, have been geared toward returning workers to jobs they held before the novel coronavirus outbreak; but those might not be the jobs the economy demands in a slow-to-recover world with new social norms and entire industries like elder-care likely to be reimagined. 
""Some of this has to start with where do you see growth"" in the future, Barkin said. His thought was echoed in a recent New York Fed study on how job training programs struggled after the last recession to adapt to in-demand occupations, possibly prolonging unemployment.
'MAIN STREET' SET TO OPEN
The Fed is expected by next week to open its ""Main Street Lending Program,"" which will provide four-year loans to businesses with between 500 to 15,000 employees. The signature program, one of several measures taken by the U.S. central bank to battle the crisis, was announced about two months ago but delayed as officials wrangled over complex details.
Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, whose bank will administer the program, described the hunt for a sweet spot in which loans are too expensive for firms that ""have no problems"" while troubled borrowers are weeded out by private banks who must put some of their money at risk for each loan the Fed makes.
""What we are really looking for is firms that were doing fine going into the end of last year,"" Rosengren said on Sunday on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" program.
At up to $600 billion, the program is the Fed's most extensive use ever of its credit-creating powers for non-financial firms. Officials expect to avoid losses on the program, and the Fed says its aim isn't to provide bailouts - a spending issue for elected officials to decide - but to provide a credit lifeline likely to turn a profit for the central bank.
The coming weeks will tell if Fed officials got it right.
LIQUIDITY LESS IN DEMAND
The crisis programs the Fed has opened so far have been largely aimed at the financial sector, and seen only weak demand. The modest take-up is viewed as a success, a sign the central bank's announcement of support for financial markets convinced investors to keep credit flowing and allow firms like Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and others to raise money on their own.
Central banks in Europe and elsewhere have seen similar tepid use of ""liquidity"" programs, which is also viewed as evidence the financial sector only needs to know that central bank help is available if needed, not to actually tap it.
In the case of programs for potentially thousands of firms in the real economy, however, even Fed officials say they expect strong demand - and don't want to be seen as too strict in the midst of a global crisis.
Other central banks are working through the same issues.
The Bank of Japan has designed a program along the lines of what the Fed is doing. Britain's experience shows why the details are important. When the British government offered to guarantee 80% of loans banks made to companies to navigate the crisis, banks were still reluctant to lend. When the guarantee extended to 100%, the flow of credit doubled. 
What that means for the future will be a core concern for policymakers as the recovery takes shape.
Some economists have begun discussing the legacy of bad debt that may be left behind by the pandemic, and whether the same sorts of programs erected to erase bad loans in the early 1990s savings and loan crisis or the 2007 housing meltdown may be needed again.
For labor markets and business investment, meanwhile, the ""reallocation shock"" has already begun, University of Chicago economists Jose Maria Barrero, Nick Bloom, and Steven J. Davis argued in a recent paper. They estimated more than 40% of the pandemic-related job losses will prove permanent, and said governments should not encourage workers to wait for their return, for example through programs that extend generous unemployment benefits too far into the future.

The shift to new jobs and industries will ""lag the destruction,"" they wrote. ""Partly for this reason we anticipate a drawn-out economic recovery.""

1699,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 12:20AM ET</span>",Explainer: More central banks eye yield curve control. How does Japan's work?,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan's yield curve control (YCC) is drawing attention from other central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, as a possible policy tool to help economies recover from the devastation caused by coronavirus pandemic.
Fed officials, including New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams (NYSE:WMB), have recently said YCC could be a tool to complement forward guidance.
After cutting rates to historic lows, Australia's central bank set a target of around 0.25% for the three-year bond yield.
The BOJ pioneered YCC. This is how it has worked in Japan and its potential pitfalls.
WHY DID BOJ INTRODUCE YCC?
YCC is generally seen as a tool to keep borrowing costs low. But when it was adopted in 2016, the BOJ's main purpose was to avoid excessive rate declines.
After years of huge bond buying failed to fire up inflation and dried up market liquidity, the BOJ cut short-term rates below zero in January 2016 to fend off an unwelcome yen rise.
The move crushed yields across the curve, outraging financial institutions that saw returns on investment evaporate.
To pull long-term rates back above zero, the BOJ adopted YCC eight months later by adding a 0% target for 10-year bond yields to its -0.1% short-term rate target.
The idea was to control the shape of the yield curve so that short- to medium-term rates - which affect corporate borrowers - fall, without pushing down super-long yields too much and reducing returns for pension funds and life insurers.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
YCC is an efficient way to cap borrowing costs in a country like Japan, where the central bank already owns nearly half of the bond market.
Having already gobbled up so much bonds, it is hard for the BOJ to commit to buying more at a set pace. Under YCC, it only needs to buy as much as needed to achieve its 0% yield target.
When yields are stable around the target, the BOJ can taper purchases. At a time like now when the government is ramping up debt issuance to fund a huge stimulus package, the BOJ can accelerate purchases. By doing so, it can help keep government borrowing costs low and maximise the effect of fiscal spending.
WHAT ARE THE PITFALLS?
By committing to keep yields at a certain level, central banks lose control over how much bonds they buy.
The biggest challenge for the BOJ was to keep super-long bond yields from falling too much and narrow financial institutions' margins.
When yields rise, the BOJ can simply ramp up buying. When they fall, it could reduce purchases. But that creates communication challenges, as it runs counter to its pledge to keep monetary policy ultra-loose.
YCC also limits the BOJ's monetary easing options. Cutting the rate targets is not ruled out but seen as a highly unlikely option due to the pain it inflicts on commercial banks.
WOULD IT WORK IN OTHER COUNTRIES?
In Japan, YCC is seen as a tool directly aimed at capping bond yields. Fed officials look at it more as something that could complement forward guidance, or communication aimed at managing long-term interest rates.
The BOJ managed to pin yields around its target for nearly four years because of its dominance in Japan's $9 trillion bond market. It would be far more challenging for the Fed, which needs to wrestle with a vastly diverse $18 trillion U.S. Treasury market.

The BOJ had to target 10-year yields because that was the most liquid zone in Japan's bond market. Other central banks could instead target the shorter end of the curve, such as the three-year zone like that for Australia.
