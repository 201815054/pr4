""Encouraging news about the present needs not to be drowned out by fears for the future. Now is not the time for the economics of Chicken Licken,"" Haldane said in a speech, citing a folk tale bird who worried about the sky falling in.
Haldane has been the most optimistic voice among the BoE's interest rate-setters since the lockdown.
In his speech on Wednesday he said none of the conditions that would justify taking rates negative had been met.
Haldane acknowledged that Britain faced an ""unholy trinity of risks from COVID, unemployment and Brexit"" but it was important that the economy's quicker-than-expected recovery, so far, from the lockdown was not overlooked.
""My concern at present is that good news on the economy is being crowded-out by fears about the future,"" he said in his speech delivered online to Cheshire and Warrington Local Economic Partnership body.

""This is human nature at times of stress. But it can also make for an overly-pessimistic popular narrative, which fosters fear, fatalism and excess caution. This is unhealthy in itself but, if left unaddressed, also risks becoming self-fulfilling.""

Representative Michael McCaul, who chairs the China task force launched by House of Representatives Republicans earlier this year, said such negotiations would be ""an important foreign policy statement to make,"" and help hold China accountable for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has drawn fire from President Donald Trump.
""It is very much on their radar screen,"" McCaul told Reuters, when asked if the Trump administration and its top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, would pursue a deal. ""I don't think that Lighthizer has 100% approved it, but...it is one of the options on the table for them and I think a recommendation coming from the task force would carry a lot of weight."" 
The proposal is one of 400 recommendations outlined in a report set to be released later on Wednesday by the task force.
The report will also recommend bolstering U.S. medical supply chains, sanctioning Chinese telecoms companies engaged in economic or industrial espionage, and evaluating whether the Beijing's repression of its Uigher Muslim minority amounts to genocide. 
Taiwan has long sought a free trade agreement with the United States, its most important supporter on the international stage, but Washington has complained about barriers to access for U.S. pork and beef.
Last month, Taiwan paved the way for an eventual deal by announcing an easing of restrictions on the import of U.S. beef and pork that is expected to go into effect on Jan. 1. 
Taiwan-U.S. trade last year was worth $85.5 billion, with the United States running a $23.1 billion deficit. Taiwan was the United States' 14th biggest export market in 2019.

The United States, like most countries, has no official relations with Taiwan, which is claimed by Beijing as sovereign Chinese territory. China has been stepping up its military activities near the island.

WASHINGTON/BOSTON (Reuters) - Turmoil in money market mutual funds sparked by the coronavirus pandemic shows that decade-old reforms to the $4.4 trillion industry may not be enough to avert major outflows during a future crisis, Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Justin Muzinich said on Tuesday.
The remarks were the latest to raise expectations a new round of rulemaking may be on the way for money funds, which faced turbulence this spring as the COVID-19 pandemic shook Wall Street before Washington officials stepped in.
Muzinich told a New York Federal Reserve conference that the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility created in March was critical to restoring financial market functioning as broad shutdowns of the U.S. economy got underway.
But high demand for fund withdrawals was due to different metrics than those operating during the 2008 financial crisis, he said.
In 2008, the Reserve Primary Fund ""broke the buck"" when its net asset value fell below $1 as a banking crisis accelerated, causing a stampede of fund withdrawals that were quelled only by a U.S. Treasury backstop for over $3 trillion in fund assets.
The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation required money market mutual funds to hold 30% of their assets in instruments that are liquid within a week, among other reforms. But Muzinich said that when some funds neared this threshold in March, withdrawal requests accelerated.
""The events of this past March show that those reforms may not be enough,"" Muzinich said. ""For example, one might ask whether we have exchanged one psychological bright line for another.""
Muzinich said such lines have the potential to create ""run dynamics"" in markets as they are approached. But he stopped short of calling for further specific reforms.
""While policymakers were able to avert a run, it is worth asking whether there are ways to enhance the liquidity resources available to funds without using a bright-line test, or whether there are ways to draw a line without creating a first-mover advantage,"" Muzinich added.
Peter Crane, founder of money fund research company Crane Data, said the remarks add to expectations new rules will be created for money funds, sometimes seen as rivals by more closely-regulated banks.
""Certainly from the looks of it new money fund regulations might be coming,"" Crane said.
He also noted a Sept. 24 speech by Dalia Blass, the top fund regulator of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, who said her division will analyze the events of March and look to build a resilient market ""while preserving the important role of money market funds in the short-term funding markets.""
Low yields on U.S Treasuries and other debt have forced big money fund sponsors to waive fees just to keep investors in their products this year, or to close them to new investors.

3,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 01:20AM ET</span>",Fact-checking U.S. economic claims in tumultuous Trump-Biden debate,"By Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden battled over the economy - and everything else - at their first ever head-to-head debate on Tuesday. 
Trump said the United States is coming back ""incredibly well"" from the coronavirus shutdown, but Biden suggested it wasn't working right now for ""all the small towns and working class towns in America."" 
Here are some of their claims and checks on their accuracy: 
CORONAVIRUS RECOVERY 
""We had 10.4 million people in a four-month period that we've put back in the workforce. That's a record the likes of which nobody's ever seen before.... Our country is coming back incredibly well,"" Trump said. 
U.S. businesses did add 10.6 million jobs from April to August, Labor Department data shows, a record four-month period. 
However, that's also just under half the 22.1 million jobs lost from February to April, as the coronavirus led to shutdowns of schools and offices nationwide. 
GRAPHIC: Jobs fell off a cliff - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ECONOMY-DATA/xlbvglzxepq/chart.png 
Employment in U.S. manufacturing - a sector that Trump said Tuesday he had revived - is 720,000 jobs short of February’s level. 
""Millionaires and billionaires like him...have done very well,"" Biden said of Trump. The combined wealth of billionaires jumped in the weeks after the coronavirus lockdowns, the Institute for Policy Studies found. 
SMALL BUSINESS 
Biden claimed Trump has ""done nothing to help small businesses."" 
Trump signed Congress' $2.3 trillion pandemic relief package in March, which created the Paycheck Protection Program that distributed about $525 billion in forgivable loans to more than 5 million small businesses. 
The program expired before it was fully tapped out, leaving $130 billion unused. Federal Reserve officials have sounded loud warnings in recent days that much needed to be done to keep small businesses afloat. 
RECORD ON JOB CREATION 
""We handed him a booming economy. He blew it,"" Biden said, while Trump claimed, ""We built the greatest economy in history.""
As vice president, Biden helped oversee the recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis, which took years. In President Barack Obama's second term the economy added about 2.5 million jobs per year. That's better than the around 2.1 million per year during Trump's first three years in office. 
By February, just before the coronavirus crisis hit, unemployment was plumbing 50-year lows, helping boost wages for those making the least and drawing in more workers from the sidelines than many economists had thought possible. 
STOCK MARKET 
""When the stock market goes up, that means jobs,""
Trump said. 
Stock prices typically track investor expectations for future corporate earnings and do not necessarily mean more jobs, especially right now. 
While the economy has recouped only half the jobs lost since the crisis began, the S&P 500 Index had regained its entire 35% loss by August, climbing to a new record in early September before falling again, ending Thursday a little more than 1% below its February closing high.

4,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 01:10AM ET</span>","Ally of Japan PM urges more fiscal, monetary stimulus to boost virus-hit economy","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan should keep selling government bonds to the central bank to pay for the cost of reflating the economy out of a pandemic-induced slump, an academic close to new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said.
There are ""no limits"" to what monetary policy can do to achieve higher inflation, at least until the Bank of Japan achieves its elusive 2% inflation target, Kaetsu University Professor Yoichi Takahashi told Reuters in an interview.
A former finance ministry bureaucrat, Takahashi keeps close contact with Suga via mobile phone and email.
He met with the premier at a Tokyo hotel days after Suga was elected to succeed Shinzo Abe, who resigned due to poor health.
The two discussed ""economy and other issues,"" Takahashi said, declining to comment in detail.
""Suga was absolutely right to say he would continue Abenomics,"" Takahashi said, referring to Abe's reflationary recipe comprised of bold monetary easing, flexible fiscal spending and reform.
Takahashi hailed Suga's intention to proceed with the third arrow of structural reform, which made little headway under Abenomics, and there's room left for the first two arrows, monetary policy easing and fiscal spending.
Takahashi criticised financial institutions for complaining about dwindling profits caused by the central bank's negative interest rate policy.
There are many things regional banks can do such as reviewing business models and streamlining operations before they are forced into realignment, he added.
""Who's complaining about side effects of monetary easing? It's wrong to make such an argument. The BOJ should keep buying government bonds as there's no limit to monetary policy.""
The government for its part should not hesitate to boost fiscal spending at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world's third-largest economy hard, Takahashi said.
When taken together with central bank assets, Japan's debt would become much smaller than official estimates that put it more than twice the size of its $5 trillion economy, the worst among industrial countries.
""It's ""misleading to warn Japan is saddled all over with debt. Looking at consolidated base, there's more room for fiscal spending,"" Takahashi said. ""The government should simply issue more bonds and have the BOJ buy them under policy mix.""
Analysts polled by Reuters last month forecast the economy would contract by 6% in the current fiscal year to March, more than previously expected.

Sheikh Nawaf succeeds his half brother, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, who died on Tuesday at the age of 91. Sheikh Nawaf, the crown prince since 2006, had been serving as acting head of state since July, when the emir was flown to the U.S. for medical treatment.
The new leader comes to power at a time when Kuwait is facing the highest budget deficit in its history, brought on by the drop in oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic. A potential solution to its brewing liquidity crisis has been blocked by parliamentary opposition to a law that would allow the government to borrow, as other Gulf nations have done in response to the dual crisis.
While Kuwait’s oil and foreign policy is unlikely to change, its domestic political landscape could be redrawn under the new leadership, particularly if Sheikh Nawaf makes a bid for national reconciliation. Such an initiative could help unblock Kuwait’s gridlocked politics and restore some balance among the different branches of the ruling family.
Kuwait is the only country in the Gulf where nationals have a genuine say in how they’re governed, but the resulting political paralysis means it’s been left behind by less democratic neighbors like the United Arabic Emirates. The emir appoints the prime minister and political parties are banned, so there’s no coherent opposition. The elected parliament is often filled with populist independents who butt heads with governments they accuse of being too soft on corruption.
Opposition Meetings
Sheikh Nawaf has split from his predecessor in meeting with two of Kuwait’s veteran opposition politicians, Ahmed Khateeb and Ahmed Al-Saadoun, amid calls to allow the return of self-exiled opposition leaders. The new leader also recently received proposals for political and economic reforms from two opposition politicians. The meetings came ahead of crucial parliamentary elections later this year.
The opposition has boycotted parliamentary polls since December 2012, when the electoral law was amended at the order of the former emir. The boycott followed one of the biggest opposition rallies in the nation’s history, as critics called for the government to share more power with elected politicians.
The opposition claimed at the time that the changes to voting rules were aimed at reducing its chances of winning and made it easier for candidates to buy votes. The government said the amendments were intended to ensure stability and boost democracy.
According to the constitution, the crown prince ascends to power upon an emir’s death. That would leave Sheikh Nawaf with the duty of appointing a new crown prince, which he has one year to do. The new emir needs the endorsement of parliament for his crown prince nominee. In theory, parliament could reject the emir’s choice, forcing him to submit three fresh nominees for the house to vote on.
Sheikh Nawaf, born in Kuwait on June 25, 1937, is the sixth son of Kuwait’s tenth ruler, Sheikh Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah. He was first appointed to the cabinet in 1978 as interior minister, and thereafter held the defense and social affairs portfolios. Sheikh Nawaf has also served as deputy chief of the national guard. He was educated in Kuwait and is married with four sons and one daughter.

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Tuesday it had closed loans to seven large airlines hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and urged Congress to save tens of thousands of airline jobs by extending billions in payroll assistance.
The Treasury said in a statement the seven carriers were Alaska Airlines, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Frontier Airlines, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp , Hawaiian Airlines,  SkyWest  (NASDAQ:SKYW) Airlines and United Airlines. 
Airlines and unions were still heavily lobbying Congress ahead of a Wednesday deadline for a new $25 billion bailout to keep workers on the payroll for another six months, but industry officials acknowledge they face an uphill battle with just hours left.
U.S. airlines received $25 billion in March under the CARES Act, primarily in the form of grants to keep employees on payroll through September and avoid furloughs.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged Congress on Tuesday to extend the payroll assistance program ""so we can continue to support aviation industry workers as our economy reopens and we continue on the path to recovery."" Last week, Mnuchin ruled out executive action to avert airline layoffs.
House of Representatives Democrats have backed a $2.2 trillion measure that would provide assistance to many hard-hit sectors as well as direct relief for Americans. They have been reluctant to support a stand-alone measure that would only aid airline workers.
Nick Calio, who heads the airline trade group Airlines for America, said Tuesday that carriers ""remain hopeful that Congress will act quickly to save these jobs before the Sept. 30 deadline – which is tomorrow – but time is running out.""
American Airlines said Friday it secured a $5.5 billion Treasury loan and could tap up to $2 billion more in October. 
Airlines, which together continue to burn through $5 billion a month, have until Sept. 30 to decide whether to draw from the $25 billion U.S. Treasury loan fund, which was authorized by Congress in March.
Treasury said it expects ""the initial loan amounts will be increased as a result of some major airlines determining not to move forward with loans"" and could boost loans to as much as $7.5 billion per carrier.

Airlines have also tapped capital markets to bolster liquidity, but passenger traffic still down 68% from pre-pandemic levels.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Canadian home prices, which rallied more sharply than expected this year, are set to rise by less than consumer inflation next year as higher unemployment and lower immigration levels cool down the market, a Reuters poll of analysts showed.
The resource-rich economy went into its deepest recession on record this year due to the coronavirus pandemic that shuttered businesses and halted trade. Over 150,000 people have been infected in Canada.
But the economy has recovered significantly over the past month, cushioned by the Bank of Canada's cumulative 150 basis points of interest rate cuts and massive fiscal spending by the government, with expectations for a faster economic recovery than most of its trading partners.
Housing starts hit a 13-year high in July and home prices rose at their fastest pace in over three years, suggesting a solid rebound, recent data showed.
The Sept. 15-25 poll of 14 property market analysts and economists showed house prices would rise 6.0% on average this year nationally, the highest prediction since polling began for this period in November 2018. Three months ago, they were expected to rise only 1.5% in 2020.
""Housing has been quite resilient so far, most likely reflecting a backlog of projects on hold from the spring lockdown, pent-up demand from higher income households that were less affected by the pandemic and ultra-low interest rates,"" said Tony Stillo, director of Canada economics at Oxford Economics.
""While new federal income support programs should lessen downside risks, several government emergency support programmes are set to expire this fall and we expect a modest retreat in housing activity and lower prices later this year and through mid-2021, especially in urban condo markets.""
For next year, house prices were expected to rise 1.0%, compared with a 1.2% fall predicted in the June poll. But in a worst-case scenario, Canadian house prices were predicted to rise only 2.0% in 2020 and fall 10.0% next year.
""The housing market will face its toughest challenge in 2021 as the combo of disposable income, low mortgage rates and deferrals, that helped boost the market in 2020, reverse course and work against prices,"" said Brendan LaCerda, senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics.
In Toronto, house prices were expected to rise 9.0% this year and 2.0% next year, compared to 3.0% and -3.1%, respectively, predicted in the previous survey.
For Vancouver, house prices were forecast to rise 3.3% this year and 2.0% in 2021, compared to a 1.8% and 2.9% fall predicted in June.
Still, eight of 13 economists with a view said the risks to their outlook were skewed more to the downside, citing high unemployment and lower immigration as the biggest hurdles to the Canadian housing market over the coming year.
""Unemployment rate will remain high throughout 2021. A supplemental risk is a worldwide second wave in the pandemic which would stop international migration flows which in Canada are vital to sustain housing demand,"" said Marc Pinsonneault, senior economist at National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to advance a temporary funding bill to keep the government open through Dec. 11, with final passage of the measure expected on the deadline, Wednesday.
Government funding runs out at midnight Wednesday. The legislation, if passed by then and signed into law by President Donald Trump, would maintain current funding levels for most programs, avoiding a government shutdown in the middle of a pandemic and weeks ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. election.
The Senate voted 82-6 on a procedural motion to advance the temporary funding bill, with all six no votes cast by Republicans.
The Democratic-led House of Representatives approved the measure a week ago after Democrats struck a deal with the White House and Republicans on farmers' aid and nutritional assistance for children.
Senate Democrats acknowledged they had stretched out action on the stopgap bill in recent days as part of their protest against Senate Republicans' rush to approve a new Supreme Court nominee weeks before the presidential election. But a Senate Democratic aide also said Democrats would ""ensure the government will not shut down.""
The bill generally maintains current spending levels and gives lawmakers more time to work out budget details for the fiscal year that ends on Sept. 30 2021, including for military operations, healthcare, national parks, space programs, and airport and border security.
The legislation's Dec. 11 end date will require Congress to return to the government funding question again during its post-election lame-duck session, after what is likely to be a bruising fight to confirm Trump's third Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett.

Congressional Democrats have had a stormy relationship with the White House over federal funding since Trump took office early in 2017, disagreeing over the president's demands for billions of dollars to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall and a range of other domestic priorities.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - North Korea has a ""reliable and effective war deterrent for self-defense"" and will now focus on developing its economy, North Korea's U.N. Ambassador Kim Song said on Tuesday, though he acknowledged that international sanctions were a hindrance. 
Addressing the U.N. General Assembly, Kim also said the ""anti-epidemic situation in our country is now under safe and stable control"" as a result of measures taken to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. North Korea has said it has no confirmed cases, though some U.S. officials have cast doubt on that claim.
Already weighed down by tough international sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, Pyongyang is also facing significant economic damage from strict border closures and other measures aimed at preventing a coronavirus outbreak and struggling to cope with damage from recent storms and flooding.
""Based on its reliable guarantee for safeguarding the security of the state and people, the DPRK is now directing all its efforts to economic construction,"" said Kim, using his country's formal name - Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
""It is a matter of fact that we badly need an external environment favourable for economic construction,"" he said. ""But, we cannot sell off our dignity just in a hope for brilliant transformation – the dignity which we have defended as valuable as our own life. This is our steadfast position.""
He said North Korea was still being threatened by military hardware like stealth fighters being used on the Korean Peninsula and ""nuclear strike means of all kinds are directly aimed at the DPRK.""
""Genuine peace can only be safeguarded when one possesses the absolute strength to prevent war itself,"" Kim said. ""As we have obtained the reliable and effective war deterrent for self-defense by tightening our belts, peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the region are now firmly defended.""
Independent U.N. sanctions monitors reported to the U.N. Security Council in August that North Korea was pressing on with its nuclear weapons program and several countries believe it has ""probably developed miniaturised nuclear devices to fit into the warheads of its ballistic missiles.""
Jenny Town, a Stimson Center fellow and deputy director of 38 North, said that in the envoy's speech ""there were no overt threats or hints of shows of force or demonstrations of power in the near future. It was very focused on rebuilding and recovering the internal situation.""
She added that while North Korea wants sanctions relief ""they aren't going to simply give up their weapons on promises of a brighter future"" and there would need to be tangible moves to prove that relations with the United States had changed before Pyongyang could justify taking measures that would jeopardize its security.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump have met three times since 2018, but failed to make progress on U.S. calls for Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and North Korea's demands for an end to sanctions.

North Korea's ruling party plans a congress in January to decide a new five-year plan, state media reported last month, after a party meeting noted serious delays in improving the national economy and living standards.

The UK Internal Market Bill, which ministers acknowledge breaks international law, was approved by 340 votes to 256 and now passes to the House of Lords for debate.
The bill seeks to protect free trade between Britain's four nations once a Brexit transition period ends, but has soured relations with Brussels just as time is running out to reach a deal on their long-term relationship.
After an initial uproar within Prime Minister Boris Johnson's party, including criticism from three former Conservative prime ministers, a rebellion was snuffed out by a concession to give parliament a say over using the powers. 
The government says clauses in the bill which override the Withdrawal Agreement, signed by Johnson in January, are necessary to protect free trade with Northern Ireland, and will only be used if talks on a border solution with the EU fail.
The EU, which wants to make sure Northern Ireland's open border with member state Ireland does not act as a back door for goods to come into the bloc, says it is an extremely serious violation of the exit treaty and has threatened to sue. 
Scrutiny in the House of Lords, parliament's upper chamber, is expected to take until early December. Johnson does not have a majority there and revisions to the most contentious clauses are likely to have strong support.
But talks with the EU are expected to move more quickly, and if a deal can be reached on an Irish border solution the powers may not be needed.

If there is no deal, any changes made by the Lords would need approval from the Commons, creating potential for a political standoff.

In its balance of risks update, the financial stability council said in a statement that challenges remain, including the operation of markets, credit flows and risk management.
While the economy has seen reduced risk premiums and interest rates, and a stronger peso currency since April, financial conditions will be closely tied to the evolution of the pandemic, the statement added.
The council called the country's financial system ""solid,"" noting that the banking system has shown sufficient capital and liquidity while some non-bank institutions should diversify financing sources.
The council, which is headed by the finance ministry and includes the central bank governor, cited as a major external risk the global economy's recovery, including ""the risk that it will be less vigorous that expected.""
Higher levels of volatility in international financial markets was also flagged as a risk, as were ""additional adjustments"" to the credit ratings of the government and state oil company Petróleos Mexicanos, or Pemex.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's high-profile Main Street Lending program may be missing one of its key targets, with half of banks in a recent survey saying they had rejected loans to companies that were in good shape before the pandemic but too damaged by it to justify a loan. 
In crafting one of its cornerstone responses to the coronavirus recession, Fed officials said they wanted the Main Street program to help firms that were solvent before the pandemic find a financial bridge to better times.
But 44 of 86 bank senior loan officers in a Fed survey released on Tuesday said they had rejected some Main Street loans for firms that were ""creditworthy before the COVID-19 crisis, but too severely impacted to remain viable and hence unable to repay the loan.""
The response points to the sort of economic damage that programs like Main Street were meant to limit. It also highlights calls for the Fed and the U.S. Treasury Department to be willing to take more risks in supporting firms that might ultimately fail.
The survey, offering a first look by the Fed at how the Main Street program is playing out among banks, suggests that as it stands the program's use may well remain limited.
The results indicated that while banks expect demand for business loans to increase or hold steady in coming months, there is no clear sign that the so-far limited use of the Fed program will change much in response.
Rather, nearly three-fourths of respondents said they had made no Main Street loans at all or were not registered for the program. For most of those that had made loans, the Fed's Main Street program accounted for less than 2.5% of their total commercial and industrial lending. 
The lenders cited a variety of constraints around the use of the program, including Fed-imposed cash flow requirements and repayment terms that ruled out some potential borrowers, and the ability to simply make any attractive loans themselves without getting involved with the central bank.
""Respondents expected C&I loan inquiries to increase in the next three months,"" from companies in the size category eligible for the Fed's Main Street program, which is open to those with no more than 15,000 employees or $5 billion in revenue. ""However only a modest share of banks expected their willingness to extend (Main Street) loans to increase over the same period,"" the report noted.
The Main Street program is among the highest profile of the Fed's many pandemic-related programs.
But uptake has been weak. Only about $2 billion of a potential $600 billion in lending has been approved by the Fed so far. While Fed officials have characterized that as evidence the private credit system is working without Fed support, it has also led to calls for the Fed to make the loan terms easier, or even to reallocate some of the funds to other programs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden hold the first of three debates Tuesday night ahead of the Nov. 3 election, and the economy is expected to be a key topic.
At issue: What did Trump accomplish for the economy in three tumultuous years of trade wars and tax cuts? How much blame should he bear for the mass layoffs and slump triggered by the coronavirus pandemic? Can Biden convince voters he will be a better steward of the world's largest economy? 
Before March, Trump had a clear argument for reelection. Record-low unemployment and rising wages were helping the less well-off, while a record stock market buoyed richer Americans. 
Even at that point, however, growth seemed to be slowing as the impact of 2017's tax cut, which slashed taxes for companies, ebbed. 
Stacked against his campaign promises from 2016, Trump's record was mixed on issues including eliminating the trade deficit and locking in 3% annual economic growth. (See graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2P4ZAuG)
From perhaps the broadest barometer - job creation - the economy under Trump actually slowed from the trend begun during former President Barack Obama's second term, before the pandemic hit. 
The economy added about 2.5 million jobs per year from 2013 through 2016 compared to around 2.1 million per year during Trump's first three years in office.

Still, the economy was performing well through the start of 2020, a point Trump is likely to focus on Tuesday night. He is likely to highlight details such as the record-low unemployment rates reached for Black and Hispanic Americans. 
Unemployment by race: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ECONOMY/dgkvlbqbdvb/chart.png
All that, of course, ended in March. 
The pandemic drove consumers indoors and led to a wave of both voluntary and mandated business closures. After a record-setting crash in U.S. economic output from April through June, and millions of layoffs, Trump approaches November with the economy currently about 5 million jobs short of where it was when he took office. 
Trump's economy: After the pandemic - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/ELECTION/gjnvwjkjkpw/chart.png
The president's case has shifted - from promoting the ""greatest"" economy in U.S. history to arguing he is better equipped to restore it. 
Biden and his supporters argue https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-economy-factbox/trump-biden-offer-clashing-visions-on-reopening-economy-idUSKBN2681FW Trump's response to the pandemic was slow, ineffective, and made the situation worse.
More than 200,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus, making the United States the country with by far the highest death toll. In the background, the economy has been recovering faster than initially expected, but the virus also continues to spread, putting the economic recovery at risk. 

Models that use economic data to predict election results are harsh on incumbents when jobs numbers are weak, and analysts note that the economy has gone from being an asset for Trump to a liability. ""A recessionary unemployment rate and depressed incomes following the expiry of government aid programs will push the pocketbook votes toward Joe Biden,"" Oxford Economics analysts predicted this week.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan will this week begin the process of selling unused telecom spectrum in an auction it hopes will raise around $1 billion and enhance network capacity, said three senior government officials familiar with the matter.
The spectrum is in the 1800 and 2100 MHz bands typically used by operators for 4G LTE (long-term evolution) networks that offer faster video streaming and Internet downloads, said the officials.
They asked not to be named as they were not authorised to discuss the matter with the media.
The country plans to kick-start the process by laying out plans to retain an international consulting firm that would design the auction process, and advise on base pricing and other details, they said, adding that no sale date has yet been set.
Pakistan is anxious to replenish state coffers that have been hit by a slump in the economy and in tax collections exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.
A spokesman for Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said the process to hire a consultant for ""Spectrum Auction 2020-21"" has been initiated. He declined to give further details.
The country has some 85 million 3G/4G subscribers, and the upcoming auction is seen a precursor to any 5G launch.
The Pakistan telecom market is dominated by Jazz, backed by Netherlands-based Veon Ltd (AS:VON);  Telenor  Pakistan, backed by Norway's state-controlled Telenor (OL:TEL); Zong, owned by China Mobile (HK:0941) and Ufone, which is controlled by state-owned Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd.

17,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 11:35AM ET</span>","Bank of England realistic about challenge of sub-zero rates for banks, Bailey says","LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the central bank was realistic about the challenges negative interest rates would pose for the banking system, but repeated he was not ruling them out as a way to help Britain's economy.
Bailey said the big share of retail deposits - which have tended to continue offering positive rates to investors even in countries which have cut rates below zero - in Britain's banking system could reduce the effectiveness of any BoE negative rates.
""That does not mean to say that we rule out using negative interest rates for a moment,"" Bailey said in an online speech given to Queen's University Belfast on Tuesday. 
""It means to say we are realistic enough, I think, to know that the transmission mechanism would be affected.""
Sterling jumped by half a cent against the U.S. dollar on Bailey's comments before falling back.
Investors have been trying to work out the likelihood of the BoE following the lead of the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, as well as other central banks, and taking rates below zero for the first time.
The BoE said this month it would look during the fourth quarter at how it might be able to implement negative rates if needed, building on an announcement in August that the option was part of its toolbox.
Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said on Monday he thought the floor for the central bank's key interest rate remained at its current level of 0.1%.
But another interest rate setter, Silvana Tenreyro, said in a weekend newspaper interview that the BoE's investigation into whether negative rates might help the economy had found ""encouraging"" evidence.
Bailey reiterated that the BoE had not reached a judgement on whether or when to use sub-zero rates for the first time and that he wanted to push back against speculation that a shift in stance would be coming soon.
He also said Britain's economy had performed a bit more strongly than the BoE thought as recently as last month but there were signs that the recovery will not be as strong going forward.

Economic activity was probably about 7-10% weaker between July and September than before the coronavirus pandemic and had finished the third quarter growing more strongly than in the period as a whole, Bailey said.

(Reuters) - Broad weakness in emerging stocks and volatility stemming from U.S. election uncertainty have created value opportunities in developing markets, a client portfolio manager at fund house Eastspring Investments said.
Samuel Bentley told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Tuesday his fund was considering increasing exposure to South Korea, Mexico and South Africa.
""U.S. elections are typically a volatile time for emerging markets, and so we expect some good opportunities to top up this year,"" said Bentley, whose firm prefers to assess political impact on company earnings over hedging event-risk.

Bentley expects U.S.-China relations to improve after the Nov. 3 election, which he said will drive the dollar lower. (DXY)
""We see a weaker dollar and progress on a COVID-19 vaccine as positives for emerging markets.""
The dollar (=USD) lost 3% in the third quarter, which will be its worst since mid-2017, but it gained 3% in the month of September.
Eastspring, a unit of insurer  Prudential  plc (L:PRU) and which manages assets worth $220 billion, is bullish on emerging financials, energy, industrial and technology hardware stocks, Bentley said.

South Korea, which has the second-largest weighting in Eastspring's portfolio at about 15%, presents opportunities across sectors, Bentley said.
China, to which Eastspring has allocated 35% of its portfolio, provides ""stock-specific opportunities outside expensive e-commerce,"" he said.
Eastspring cut exposure to Taiwan after some local tech stocks performed well, Bentley said.
It has raised its investments in South Africa, ""where investors may tend to overlook (opportunities) given the unfavourable news headlines"", he said. 
It is now looking to buy more Indian stocks too.
""We have been underweight (on India) outside a few interesting financial and IT names. But recent weakness has put a few names on our radar.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economic recovery should continue, but depends on people using masks to slow the spread of the coronavirus and eventual deployment of a vaccine, Philadelphia Federal Reserve president Patrick Harker said on Tuesday.
With the economy currently growing faster than initially expected since a recession took hold last spring, Harker said continued growth ""depends on a sustained decline in the rate of new infections -- probably a result of nearly universal mask-wearing, especially indoors -- that ensures only sporadic new outbreaks,"" Harker said in webcast comments to the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum.
He said he is also ""assuming that a vaccine becomes widely available sometime mid to late next year.""
Several vaccines are already in trials, but their success and the speed of deployment is not guaranteed. The U.S. as well is far from suppressing the spread of the virus or even agreed on the protocols for mask wearing. 
Harker said that while the health crisis continues, federal elected officials need to renew government aid ""commensurate"" to the problems faced by unemployed workers, small businesses and other hardest hit by the recession. The policymaker said he is assuming there will be at least another $1 trillion in fiscal stimulus as part of his economic forecast, and says GDP will go down by several tenths without it. 
Even if the recovery continues and a new surge of the virus is avoided, ""employment, unfortunately, probably won't be back to pre-pandemic levels until 2023,"" Harker said. Given the high levels of joblessness, ""I would urge lawmakers to consider providing additional support soon.""
The economic recovery could resemble a bumpy "" Nike  (NYSE:NKE) swoosh,"" with growth going up and down based on the virus. ""We've really got to get the virus under control because that is driving everything,"" he said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro took to social media on Tuesday to hit back at accusations his government is using accounting gimmicks to fund a new minimum income program without breaking its spending cap, its most important fiscal rule.
Bolsonaro's charm offensive comes as Brazilian markets were under pressure for a second day on fears the spending spree shows he is unwilling to take the tough decisions needed to rein in record deficit and debt, and get the public finances back to health.
Fiscal responsibility and the spending cap are the ""rails of the economy,"" wrote Bolsonaro, who critics say is pushing this scheme and the controversial way it is funded with an eye on the 2022 presidential elections. 
""Those responsible for destroying millions of jobs are now silent. My government seeks to anticipate the serious social problems that may arise in 2021 if nothing is done to meet the needs of all these people who have lost everything, or almost everything,"" he wrote on his social media sites.
Together with government leaders in Congress and Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, Bolsonaro on Monday announced a new welfare transfer program for the poor called 'Renda Cidada', an extension and expansion of the current 'Bolsa Família' cash transfer program.
Paying for Renda Cidada will involve an accounting maneuver allowing the government to tap into 55 billion reais ($9.7 billion) in the budget earmarked for future court-ordered debt payments to businesses and individuals, and cash set aside for education.
Brazilian markets balked. Stocks and the currency fell, while interest rates futures rose on Monday as investors viewed it as an accounting gimmick not to break the spending ceiling fueled by populist, political motives.
In early trading on Tuesday, the real and stocks were still lower and long-term borrowing costs were higher.
""If the administration does indeed decide to follow this course, we expect price action to continue trading poorly,"" Citi strategists wrote in a note on Tuesday. 

""We would not be surprised if the government drops this controversial solution after its negative repercussions in asset price, and among fiscal accounts specialists and important Congressmen like Rodrigo Maia, the Speaker of the Lower House,"" they said.

21,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>","Policymakers Should Have Freedom to Lift Rates, Kaplan Says","(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan said he dissented at the central bank’s September meeting so that future policy makers wouldn’t be forced to keep rates near zero.
“I would like future committees to have the flexibility to adapt to those future economic conditions so they can use their best judgment in deciding on the appropriate stance of monetary policy,” Kaplan wrote in a letter published Tuesday.
The letter outlines his rationale for dissenting as well as his views on the economy and energy markets. Kaplan also said he’s skeptical about the benefits of additional forward guidance right now.
Kaplan sees the economy contracting 3% this year and growing 3.5% next year. The core personal-consumption inflation rate will rise 1.6% at the end of this year and 1.8% by the end of next year. The unemployment rate will fall to 5.7% by the end of 2021.
Kaplan was one of two dissenting voters at the Fed’s Sept. 15-16 meeting, where policy makers took a more dovish tone. They signaled rates would stay near zero through 2023 and adapted their post-meeting statement to reflect their new strategy of allowing inflation to rise above 2% after periods of under-performance.
Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari dissented in favor of waiting for a rate hike until “core inflation has reached 2% on a sustained basis.”
Kaplan said he expects it’ll be appropriate to keep interest rates near zero until the economy is on track to achieve maximum employment and inflation averaging 2% over time, which will take until late 2022 or “sometime in 2023.” As the economy approaches those benchmarks, keeping rates near zero may mean that policy actually becomes more accommodative, he wrote.
“I can understand why future committees will want to remain accommodative at that point in order to ensure we achieve our goals, but will they want to be effectively increasing the level of accommodation by keeping the federal funds rate at zero?” Kaplan wrote. “I would like future Committees to have the flexibility to make this judgment.”
He also said that low rates punish savers and encourage greater risk-taking, creating distinctions in financial markets. Kaplan votes on this year’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee but the Dallas Fed won’t again until 2023 under the reserve bank rotation system.

Kaplan said officials learned in the last recovery that the unemployment rate can fall much lower than previously expected without triggering excess inflation, and that a such a tight labor market can bring previously sidelined workers back.
The coronavirus pandemic has hit these individuals the hardest, Kaplan wrote. The Black and Latino unemployment rates climbed to much higher levels than that of White Americans during the height of the crisis, and remain at elevated levels today.
“These disparities are indicative of how the pandemic has disproportionately impacted person-to-person service sector jobs, and those with lower levels of educational attainment,” Kaplan wrote. “These statistics reinforce the need for greater efforts to invest in education and skills training in order to create a stronger and more inclusive labor market and help ensure that key groups of our society are not left behind in this recovery.”
He added that if Congress doesn’t continue the additional unemployment benefits, which had supported consumer spending during the early months of the pandemic, and other fiscal stimulus it would “certainly create headwinds for continued recovery.” Kaplan said support for state and local governments is also essential, as is helping small- and mid-size businesses access capital.
The Dallas Fed’s district encompasses the world’s largest shale-oil field, which has seen a huge decrease in production as energy demand disappeared this year. Kaplan estimates that production in the Permian Basin will decline to 3.8 million barrels per day in December, from 4.7 million barrels per day last year. The U.S. overall will see a decline to 10.7 million barrels per day from 12.8 last year.
Completed wells will decline 50% this year, and U.S. capital spending on exploration and development will drop by the same amount. Kaplan said oil production should be flat next year.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>",Fed's Kaplan sees costs to pinning rates at zero,"(Reuters) - The U.S. central bank should keep interest rates at their current near-zero levels until the economy is back on track to full health, likely by late 2022 or sometime in 2023, Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan said on Tuesday. 
But because the U.S. economy is likely to change in unforeseeable ways over the next few years, he said, the Fed should not tie its hands on monetary policy after the coronavirus crisis has passed. 
At that point, he said in an essay explaining his views, the Fed ""should be willing to be more accommodative than in the past,"" but it can do so even if it raises rates a bit.
""I believe there are real costs to keeping rates at zero for a prolonged period of time,"" including excessive risk-taking and distortions in financial markets. 
New tax, regulatory or trade policy; changes in the role of the dollar as the world's reserve currency; and potentially accelerating technological disruptions could also impact how the economy works, and how the Fed will need to react, he said. 
Left unsaid was one of the biggest near-term unknowns: whether Americans will reelect U.S. President Donald Trump on Nov. 3 or pick Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to replace him. 
Each would have very different tax, trade, spending, and other policies with big implications for the economy's trajectory.
Kaplan dissented earlier this month against the Fed's decision to keep rates at zero until inflation reaches and is on track to ""moderately exceed"" the Fed's 2% goal. 
""I believe that we will learn a lot over the next two years about the impact of monetary policy on achieving our inflation goals,"" Kaplan said. 
The economy is recovering faster than expected, and with additional fiscal relief and a vaccine hopefully approved in the next several months, should see the unemployment rate falling to 5.7% by the end of 2021, and core inflation rising to 1.8%, Kaplan said. No further fiscal relief poses a downside risk to that forecast, he said.

Full-year passenger traffic is set to decline 66%, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said, compared with a previously forecast 63% decline.
""The improvement that we saw in the summer months has more or less stopped,"" IATA Chief Economist Brian Pearce said. August traffic was down 75.3% in terms that reflect passenger numbers as well as distance flown, compared with a 79.5% drop in July.
Airlines are pressing governments to abandon quarantines and other travel curbs blamed for worsening the slump, and instead roll-out rapid COVID-19 testing at airports.
Load factors that measure the proportion of aircraft seats filled fell 27.2 points to a record low of 58.5% in August.
""The industry is restarting but it looks as though it’s still burning through cash,"" Pearce said. Losses will continue to mount throughout 2020, with bookings data pointing to a weak fourth quarter.
August's short-lived improvement was driven by domestic routes, down more most 50% year-on-year, while international traffic was 88% lower.
A rebound in Russia's domestic market, up 3% on last year, contrasts with Australian flights still down 88% and Chinese internal traffic still 19% lower year-on-year, IATA said.
Cargo demand was down 12.6% in August, an improvement on July's 14.4% decline, it also said. The grounding of passenger jets has reduced capacity, supporting prices.

24,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 09:30AM ET</span>",Germany's debt costs hit historic low despite record borrowing - sources,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany expects its debt servicing costs to more than halve this year and reach their lowest level despite the government's decision to take on record new borrowing in the COVID-19 pandemic, two officials told Reuters on Tuesday.
The lower-than-expected borrowing costs, partly enabled by the European Central Bank's loose monetary policy, could create a windfall of several billion euros which would reduce the pressure to cut spending once the coronavirus is contained.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz have since March unleashed an unprecedented array of rescue and stimulus measures to help Europe's largest economy recover as quickly as possible from the coronavirus shock.
The German parliament has temporarily suspended the constitutionally enshrined debt limits to allow the government finance its measures with net new borrowing of 218 billion euros this year and additional 96 billion euros next year.
The finance ministry so far has earmarked 9.6 billion euros for debt servicing in its 2020 budget which already marks a drop from some 12 billion euros in the previous year.
But the ECB's bond-buying programmes and worldwide demand for safe-haven bonds mean that the government now even expects to pay only 5 billion to 6 billion euros, a senior official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Another official said Germany's debt servicing costs stood at 6.8 billion euros as per end-August, but negative yields were likely to push the overall amount below 6 billion euros until the end of the year - and to possibly even lower levels beyond.
A finance ministry spokesman declined to comment. In its draft 2021 budget, the ministry has so far earmarked 9.8 billion euros for debt servicing. 
As German debt is in such demand that yields have turned negative, even for long-term bonds, finance ministry officials now say, only half joking, that it is actually just a matter of time before the government is not paying for its debt servicing, but actually making money out of it.

""We need to understand how changes in the market ecosystem —whether due to regulation, technology, or other factors — have influenced market resilience,"" Williams said in remarks prepared for the U.S. Treasury Market Conference. 
The Fed helped to stabilize markets after bouts of volatility last September and in March by conducting large-scale operations in the market for repurchase agreements, or repo, and by purchasing Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. Studying those scenarios can help lead to reforms that can make the financial system stronger, Williams said.
""It's crucial that our financial system can handle shocks and disruption,"" he said.

Williams did not comment on his outlook for the economy or monetary policy in his remarks.

26,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 08:09AM ET</span>","New York Region Sees 40% Bankruptcy Surge, Braces for More","(Bloomberg) -- The pandemic has battered New York City businesses, with almost 6,000 closures, a jump of about 40% in bankruptcy filings across the region and shuttered storefronts in the business districts of all five boroughs.
It’s going to get worse.
This fall, the nation’s largest city will see even more padlocked doors as companies burn through federal and private loans they tapped in March, landlords boot businesses that can’t make rent, and plummeting temperatures chill outdoor dining and shopping.
“By late fall, there will be an avalanche of bankruptcies,” said Al Togut, a lawyer who has handled insolvencies for small businesses and huge corporations like Enron. “When the cold weather comes, that’s when we’ll start to see a surge in bankruptcies in New York City.”
New York City and its businesses have reached a pivotal point. After over six months with the specter of Covid-19 hovering in every subway car and corner bodega, the virus is showing signs of resurgence.
The state of New York on Saturday reported more than 1,000 new cases for the first time since early June. Spikes emerged in south Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods with large Orthodox Jewish communities, just as they observed Yom Kippur. Meanwhile, principals called on the state to take over schools days before they restart in-person classes, saying Mayor Bill de Blasio failed to ensure enough staff to open safely.
The coming wave of business closings will touch every New Yorker as jobs get scarcer, neighborhoods lose beloved shops and families run out of cash.
Already, dwindling tax revenue has led to cutbacks in municipal services. Trash on sidewalks, unkempt parks and an increase in shootings have made it more difficult to persuade workers to return to offices, more than 150 executives told the mayor in a letter this month. A dearth of office workers is a death knell for many merchants.
“It’s a crisis, and we need to act—our economy can’t recover without saving small businesses,” said city Comptroller Scott Stringer, a candidate in next year’s mayoral election. “When they close, we don’t just lose our beloved Main Street businesses. We lose jobs, tax revenue and the economic backbone of our city.”
The pandemic could permanently close as many as a third of New York’s 230,000 businesses, according to the Partnership for New York City, a business group.
Bankruptcy filings in the region have skyrocketed since the middle of March, when the state of New York reported its first deaths from Covid-19 and Governor Andrew Cuomo closed all nonessential businesses. There were 610 filings in the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York from March 16 to Sept. 27, according to court records. That’s a 40 percent jump from the same period in 2019 and the most by far for any year since the financial crisis. The districts include some nearby counties.
Almost 6,000 New York City businesses closed from March 1 to Sept. 11, according to  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP), the website of user reviews. Over 4,000 of those closed permanently.
The carnage has been demoralizing after decades in which the city fought back from the brink of bankruptcy, the scourges of crack cocaine and violent crime, terrorist attacks and recession. The pandemic hit as the city had achieved record high employment and low crime.
Prosperity expressed itself in bustling department stores from Bergdorf’s to Macy’s. Neighborhoods flourished with artisanal food and clothing boutiques, mom and pop stores, and coffee shops that gave New Yorkers a place to feel at home outside their tiny apartments.
The nation’s business capital has always rebounded from past crises, but the advent of work-from-home in an economy increasingly dependent on white-collar jobs may be an insurmountable challenge.
Distress is on display on Madison Avenue, once a global destination bustling with glamorous shoppers. From 60th Street to 70th Street today, about 60 of the 130 storefronts are closed and locked. 
Padlocked doors and windows covered with butcher paper or plywood line a quiet boulevard. Even inside the luxury retailers that remain open, like Dolce & Gabbana and Prada (OTC:PRDSY), a handful of well-coiffed sales people and broad-shouldered security guards stand expectantly on sales floors empty of customers.
The owner of Jimmy’s Steak and Grill, a food cart on the corner of Madison and 60th, said that with nearby office buildings empty, sales of hot dogs and lamb-on-rice platters are down 60%.
“Right now, I’m supposed to have a line,” Jimmy Gonzalez said through a black mask, motioning mournfully to the empty sidewalk. Over half the food-cart owners he knows gave up. “They sell the cart, they sell the permit, they sell everything.”
Small businesses like Gonzalez’s show what’s at stake when big employers keep workers away from office towers. Manhattan businesses that use the digital payment system Square are earning only 62% of the revenue they earned pre-pandemic, according to the company.
“This is likely a result of a significant drop in the number of commuters coming into the borough,” according to Square economist Felipe Chacon.
By late September, just 15% of the city’s 1.2 million office workers had returned, according to the Partnership for New York City.
“Retail and real estate will continue to decline in New York until you can reignite the office traffic,” said Joseph Malfitano, who advised Brooks Brothers and the parent company of Ann Taylor in their bankruptcies this year.
Many New York City business owners who give up don’t even bother filing for bankruptcy, which can cost as much as $25,000, according to Leslie Berkoff, a longtime bankruptcy attorney. Owners just lock the doors and walk away.
“What’s the point of bankruptcy? Nobody’s going to chase you right now,” said Berkoff. “A lot of your vendors probably aren’t going to survive either.”
That’s what cheesemonger Patrick Watson, the owner of Stinky Bklyn in the Cobble Hill neighborhood, did when his landlord refused to renegotiate his rent. Watson quickly sold off his inventory of imported Brie and Humboldt Fog and donated the remaining staples —cans of tuna, crackers and condiments—to a homeless shelter.
“We tried. We really, really tried,” Watson wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in April. “For the safety of our crew and with no immediate end in sight, Sunday will be our last day.”
About 10 neighboring businesses also closed, including a diner, a bar and a hair salon, said Randy Peers, president of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce.
Sales remain brisk at Watson’s other business, a wineshop called Smith & Vine, possibly indicating heightened stress levels in the city.
In an effort to help restaurants, the city closed dozens of streets on weekends so they can take that space, and it’s going to continue the program into the winter, allowing propane heat lamps and tent-like enclosures.
“Once you hit below 60 degrees, it starts to get dicey,” said Vin McCann, a restaurant consultant. “I would bet you that between 25 and 50 percent of restaurants in New York City will not come back.”
Rent relief could be possible if the state allowed localities to forgive landlords’ property-tax payments in return for discounting rent owed to them, said City Councilman Mark Gjonaj, who heads the council’s small-business committee.
“This would help save struggling mom-and-pop shops while preventing landlords’ properties from going into distress,” he said.
The city’s Department of Small Business Services received about 35,000 calls for help since June and gave out about 4,000 grants and loans from an $80 million program approved early in the pandemic.
“A third of our small businesses could be closed if we don’t have a strong recovery,” said Jonnel Doris, the department’s commissioner. “The fate of small businesses will determine the fate of the city.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Risks related to political developments in the U.S. have emerged as the main economic concern for central banks, alongside trade wars and a global slowdown, according to a UBS survey.
Further disruptions of major economies by the COVID-19 crisis, including new shutdowns, were expected by a total of 42% of respondents to the survey of more than 30 central bank reserve managers.
Among non-COVID concerns affecting the global economy, trade wars ranked as the top worry for the third year in a row, cited by 81% of participants. Fear of a global economic slowdown and a return of deflationary trends ranked second, flagged by 72% of respondents.
But political developments in the U.S. emerged as a worry for 72% of participants, more than twice the percentage of those who saw it as a key risk in the previous year.
Investors are preparing for the Nov. 3 presidential election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. They're also focusing on what the outcome may mean for the United States' relationship with China after the two countries imposed tariffs on each other's goods.
For the second year running, low and negative yields in fixed-income markets remained the biggest anxiety affecting central bank FX reserves, excluding the coronavirus, with 69% of respondents citing it as a headache.
Real, or inflation-adjusted, yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries plunged below zero this year amid the coronavirus pandemic, joining Japanese, German and British equivalent debt that has for much of the past decade given negative returns.
While the survey suggested the global dominance of the U.S. dollar remained intact, the average share of dollar holdings among all participants was 67%, down from 71% the year before.

The dollar and the Chinese yuan were the currencies most added by participating sovereign institutions during the past year, the survey found.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's car makers have asked the government to reduce taxes on new vehicle purchases as part of a proposed stimulus package for the coronavirus-hit sector, according to a presentation from an industry body seen by Reuters. 
The proposal, aimed at boosting local sales of new cars as rising coronavirus cases threaten demand in key export markets, was presented to the government on Monday by the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA), its chief executive Mike Mabasa said. 
NAAMSA represents global car giants like Nissan (T:7201) and Toyota (T:7203) which produce vehicles in South Africa, with around 64% marked for export. 
Automakers want to lower the tax rate for new vehicles from 42% of the price currently to between 35% and 38%, Mabasa said. 
Removing a tax on carbon dioxide emissions imposed at purchase and reducing an ad valorem levy - a value-based tax on items considered a luxury in South Africa - could together boost new sales by almost 28,400, NAAMSA's presentation showed.
Without this, some NAAMSA members who rely heavily on export sales could find their South African operations become unviable, Mabasa warned.
""If the investments (car makers) are making are not giving them the required return, they will certainly consider leaving the country as a result of that,"" he said. 
That would hurt an ambitious 2035 plan to supercharge auto manufacturing in South Africa, a key element of President Cyril Ramaphosa's attempts to revive growth and bring unemployment down through industrialisation.
The coronavirus crisis is already thought to have put some key aims of the plan out of reach as a lockdown brought the industry to a standstill and both local and global demand collapsed.
The additional demand for new vehicles resulting from the proposed tax cuts would be equivalent to around a month of sales, Mabasa said. 
He added that NAAMSA estimated this could create some 4,000 jobs across the industry. Removing the sales tax would result in an additional 1 billion rand ($58.22 million) for the country's strained treasury, while the reduction in the ad valorem tax would have a neutral impact, as higher sales would offset the lower rate of tax per vehicle, NAAMSA estimated. 
Automakers also asked the government to set aside a portion of existing coronavirus relief, such as a COVID-19 fund for small businesses, for transport operators to stimulate fleet renewals.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>",By the numbers: The chasm where the corner cafe used to be,"By Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - How fast can you rebound from zero?
In the massive job reshuffling under way in the United States right now, the speed with which corner restaurants, the local barber or the yoga studio up the street can climb back to normal from a dead stop in March and April will be one key to whether the coronavirus leaves a lasting gash in the economy.
Those industries may seem trivial in an advanced country where attention focuses on the latest high-flash technology helping people work from home.
They aren't. In the decade-long economic expansion that ended in February, restaurants, hotels, and personal service firms played an important role.
Some industries grew more.
But the proliferation of small restaurants and similar businesses over the last decade generated a growing share of U.S. jobs, accounting for 11% of all jobs as of February. It was growth, moreover, across occupations more open to the less-skilled, helping push the U.S. unemployment rate to the record lows it hit last year and extend the gains of that expansion more broadly across the population.
For those firms, the wound from the coronavirus has been the deepest by far. From February to April, the leisure and hospitality industry lost about half of its 16.8 million jobs, the largest decline in any of the 14 industrial categories used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to describe the U.S. economy.
In a viral pandemic, the very qualities that make a neighborhood cafe cozy become a confidence breaker, so a full recovery may be slow.
Of the roughly 8 million jobs lost in the industry, 4 million were recovered as the economy reopened and firms found news ways, such as outdoor seating, to rekindle business.
But that still leaves 4 million jobs ""missing,"" and the easy part may be over. What's worrying U.S. officials now is whether those still-lost jobs will come back at all, or whether some industries have been permanently downsized.
Many of the jobs at risk were in small businesses more prone to failure for each month the crisis extends, and particularly if a new viral wave deepens the downturn.
Many were filled by minorities, women, or less skilled workers who following past recessions have had a tougher time regaining a foothold in the economy.
At the start of this downturn, economists were hopeful that its unique origins - a public health crisis that required the economy to hibernate - could be quickly reversed. They now talk about the risk of an extended ""reallocation shock"" as workers fight to retrain, switch industries and regain their place.
Economists watch different groups of people for evidence of how deep and permanent the scars might become. Among the most telling are the number of people unemployed for six months or more, and the number who have pared down their job search, out of discouragement for example.
In the opening months of this downturn, those two groups have grown 50%, to 3.6 million as of August - triple the rate of increase seen in the 2007 to 2009 recession."

Investing.com -- Banks and regulators are losing the fight against money-laundering.
Data leaked from the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network painted a picture of banks overwhelmed by the sheer volume of potentially suspect transfers, with neither the resources nor the will to tackle the problem thoroughly.
The amount of money laundered globally each year is estimated to be 2% to 5% of global GDP, as much as $2 trillion in absolute terms, according to figures from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The magazine American Banker noted that the system catches as little as 1%.
While much of the information released was largely historic, it once again ran the names of a handful of big-name banks through the mud.
Both U.S. and EU lawmakers are considering ways to improve their respective regimes: Congress is looking at the Illicit Cash Act, which would allow banks more power to know the identities of the people behind the myriad shell companies through which money is laundered. The EU, meanwhile, is looking at transferring supervision of anti-money-laundering to a new European regulator which – it is hoped – would be better at catching criminals than the overworked and sometimes compromised supervisory staff of the EU’s smaller states.2:25
Whether either will ever provide an effective defense against global organized crime is, however, another question."
31,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 07:22AM ET</span>","Meatpackers deny workers benefits for COVID-19 deaths, illnesses","By Tom Hals and Tom Polansek
(Reuters) - Saul Sanchez died in April, one of six workers with fatal COVID-19 infections at meatpacker JBS USA's slaughterhouse in Greeley, Colorado, the site of one of the earliest and deadliest coronavirus outbreaks at a U.S. meatpacking plant.
Before getting sick, the 78-year-old Sanchez only left home to work on the fabrication line, where cattle carcasses are sliced into cuts of beef, and to go to his church, with its five-person congregation, said his daughter, Betty Rangel. She said no one else got infected in the family or at Bible Missionary Church, which could not be reached for comment.
JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, denied the family's application for workers' compensation benefits, along with those filed by the families of two other Greeley workers who died of COVID-19, said lawyers handling the three claims. Families of the three other Greeley workers who died also sought compensation, a union representative said, but Reuters could not determine the status of their claims.
JBS has said the employees' COVID-19 infections were not work-related in denying the claims, according to responses the company gave to employees, which were reviewed by Reuters. 
As more Americans return to workplaces, the experience of JBS employees shows the difficulty of linking infections to employment and getting compensation for medical care and lost wages.
""That is the ultimate question: How can you prove it?"" said Nick Fogel, an attorney specializing in workers' compensation at the firm Burg Simpson in Colorado. 
The meatpacking industry has suffered severe coronavirus outbreaks, in part because production-line workers often work side-by-side for long shifts. Companies including JBS,  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) and WH Group (OTC:WHGLY) Ltd's (HK:0288) Smithfield Foods closed about 20 plants this spring after outbreaks, prompting President Donald Trump in April to order the plants to stay open to ensure the nation's meat supply. The White House declined to comment on the industry's rejections of workers' claims. The U.S. Department of Labor did not respond to a request for comment.
Tyson has also denied workers' compensation claims stemming from a big outbreak in Iowa, workers' attorneys told Reuters. Smithfield workers at a plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, also hit by a major outbreak, have generally not filed claims, a union official said, in part because the company has paid infected workers' wages and medical bills.
Smithfield declined to comment on workers’ compensation. Tyson said it reviews claims on a case-by-case basis, but declined to disclose how often it rejects them. JBS acknowledged rejecting claims but declined to say how often. It called the denials consistent with the law, without elaborating.
Workers can challenge companies' denials in an administrative process that varies by state but typically resembles a court hearing. The burden of proof, however, usually falls on the worker to prove a claim was wrongfully denied. 
The full picture of how the meatpacking industry has handled COVID-related workers' compensation remains murky because of a lack of national claims data. Reuters requested data from seven states where JBS or its affiliates have plants that had coronavirus outbreaks. Only three states provided data in any detail; all show a pattern of rejections.
In Minnesota, where JBS had a major outbreak, meatpacking employees filed 930 workers' compensation claims involving COVID-19 as of Sept. 11, according to the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry. None were accepted, 717 were rejected and 213 were under review. The agency did not identify the employers.
The Minnesota Department of Health said only two meatpacking plants there had significant coronavirus outbreaks: a JBS pork processing plant in Worthington, and a poultry plant in Cold Spring run by Pilgrim's Pride Corp (O:PPC), which is majority-owned by JBS. 
Tom Atkinson, a Minnesota workers' compensation attorney who has represented meatpacking workers, estimates up to 100 COVID-19 claims were filed by employees at the Worthington plant.
In Utah, seven JBS workers filed claims related to COVID-19 by Aug. 1 and all were denied, according to the state's Labor Commission. At least 385 workers at a JBS beef plant in Hyrum, Utah, tested positive for COVID-19.
In Colorado, 69% of the 2,294 worker compensation claims for COVID-19 had been denied as of Sept. 12. Although the state does not break down the denials by industry, a JBS spokesman told Reuters the company is rejecting claims in Colorado and that it uses the same claim-review procedures nationwide. 
JBS spokesman Cameron Bruett did not answer the question of whether JBS employees were infected on the job and declined comment on individual workers’ claims. He said the company has outsourced claim reviews to a third-party administrator. 
""Given the widespread nature of viral spread, our third-party claims administrator reviews each case thoroughly and independently,"" said Bruett.
The administrator, Sedgwick, did not respond to a request for comment. Bruett, also a spokesman for Pilgrim's Pride, did not respond to questions about infections and claims at its Minnesota plant.
At the JBS plant in Greeley, where Sanchez worked before he died, at least 291 of about 6,000 workers were infected, according to state data. The company, in its written response to the family’s claim, said that his infection was “not work-related,” without spelling out its reasoning. The two sides are now litigating the matter in Colorado's workers' compensation system. 
Under Colorado law, a workers' compensation death benefit provides about two-thirds of the deceased worker's salary to the surviving spouse and pays medical expenses not covered by insurance. If JBS had not denied the Sanchez family’s claim, that would have provided his widow a steady income and paid uncovered medical bills totaling about $10,000, according to his daughter. 
""They don't care,"" Rangel said of JBS. ""They are all about the big profits, and they are not going to give any money out.""
MASS INFECTIONS, LITTLE COMPENSATION 
The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) International Union, which represents 250,000 U.S. meatpacking and food-processing workers, said last week at least 122 meatpacking workers have died of COVID-19 and more than 18,000 had missed work because they were infected or potentially exposed. 
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) said on Sept. 11 that it had cited JBS for failing to protect workers at the Greeley plant from the virus. OSHA cited Smithfield this month for failing to protect workers at its Sioux Falls, South Dakota, plant, where the agency said nearly 1,300 workers contracted the coronavirus and four died.
Smithfield and JBS said the citations had no merit because they concerned conditions in plants before OSHA issued COVID-19 guidance for the industry. OSHA said it stands by the citations.
Workers' compensation is generally the only way to recoup medical expenses and lost wages for work-related injuries and deaths. The system protects employers from lawsuits, with few exceptions, and allows workers to collect benefits without having to prove fault or negligence. But the system was designed for factory accidents, not airborne illnesses.
In response to the coronavirus, governors and lawmakers in at least 14 states have made it easier for some employees to collect workers compensation for COVID-19 by putting the burden on companies and insurers to prove an infection did not occur at work. But most of the changes, which vary by state, only apply to workers in healthcare or emergency services. A similar proposal failed to gain support in Colorado.
Mark Dopp, general counsel for the North American Meat Institute, a trade association that represents meatpackers, said it is difficult to determine where workers get infections given extensive sanitation efforts taken by meat plants and workers' daily travel to and from the plants.
Tyson in April closed its Waterloo, Iowa, pork processing plant due to a COVID-19 outbreak. Ben Roth, a local workers’ compensation attorney, said five families of employees who died filed workers compensation claims for death benefits, and all were denied.
He said meat-processing companies have an incentive to deny every claim because admitting they caused even one infection can expose the firms to liability for all workers contracting COVID-19.
""That undercuts the argument that they want to make across the board: that you can’t prove you got it here and not at a grocery store,"" Roth said. 
Tyson said it follows state laws for workers’ compensation. The company noted that Iowa law states that disease with an equal likelihood of being contracted outside the workplace are ""not compensable as an occupational disease.”
In Colorado, Sylvia Martinez runs a group called Latinos Unidos of Greeley and said she knows of more than 20 JBS workers who applied for workers compensation and were denied. Many plant workers are not native English speakers and sought out her group for guidance, she said, adding that many don't understand their rights and fear being fired. The company's rejections have discouraged more claims, Martinez said.
""If you deny five or 10, those workers will tell their co-workers,"" she said.
'WHO IS GOING TO HIRE HIM?'
JBS also contested the claim of Alfredo Hernandez, 55, a custodian who worked at the Greeley plant for 31 years. He became infected and was hospitalized in March. He still relies on supplemental oxygen and hasn't returned to work, said his wife, Rosario Hernandez.
Generall y, companies approve claims if it looks probable that an employee was injured or sickened at work, said Erika Alverson, the attorney representing Hernandez. But JBS, she said, is arguing workers could have contracted COVID-19 anywhere.
""They're getting into, where did our clients go, what were they doing during that time, who was coming into their house, what did their spouse do, was there any other form of exposure?"" said Alverson, of the Denver firm Alverson and O’Brien. 
A judge will decide the Hernandez case in an administrative hearing. In the meantime, the Hernandez family has only his disability benefits – a portion of his salary – to cover his medical and insurance costs, Rosario Hernandez said.

""We're getting bunches of bills,"" she said.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn, the former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) head who fled Japan where he was facing trial, is launching a university business programme in Lebanon, a nation mired in a deep economic crisis blamed on years of misrule, mismanagement and corruption.
Nine months after his dramatic escape to Beirut from Tokyo, the Lebanese-French executive has unveiled a plan to shake up the business school at the Université Saint-Esprit de Kaslik (USEK), a private university north of the Lebanese capital.
Ghosn, credited with turning round the Japanese and French carmakers before he faced charges in Japan of financial wrongdoing that he denies, plans programmes to coach executives, offer technology training and help start-ups to create jobs.
Ghosn has found refuge in Lebanon where the economy is collapsing under debts amassed since the 1975-1990 civil war. A devastating blast in Beirut on Aug. 4 compounded Lebanon's woes.
""Obviously I am not interested in politics but I will dedicate time and effort into supporting Lebanon during this difficult period,"" he told Reuters at the weekend, before the formal launch of his new university programme.
At Tuesday's news conference to announce the programme, he said: ""This is about creating jobs, employment and entrepreneurs to allow society to take its role in the reconstruction of the country.""
He said Lebanon's challenge was ""the restoration of confidence"" not a lack of assets, saying the state owned infrastructure, land and hydrocarbon resources. Now it needed to execute a recovery plan, he added.
""If you bring back trust, money will come,"" he said. ""You can have an excellent plan for Lebanon but if you don't execute it you are not even at starting point.""
Ghosn, who was approached by USEK in the weeks after arriving in Lebanon at the end of December, said the business programme aimed to offer practical help. He will help supervise.
Drawing on his experience, the focus for the executive programme would be turning around companies in trouble, corporations struggling with a troubled environment and how to ""make yourself invaluable"" in a company.
'ROLE MODEL'
Ghosn said several international executives had agreed to give pro bono courses, such as Jaguar and Land Rover Chief Executive Thierry Bolloré, former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) vice-chairman Ken Curtis and venture capitalist Raymond Debbane. 
The short courses, expected to start in March, would be open to 15 to 20 senior executives in Lebanon and the Middle East.
""The role model is my experience, what I think are the basic needs of a top executive in a very competitive environment,"" he said, adding that, when he was in charge, Nissan's executive training programme in Japan had been open to other companies.
The second USEK programme, subsidised by the executive programme, would train people on new technologies, such as computer-assisted design and artificial intelligence.
Ghosn said Lebanon's jewellery exporters were among those who would benefit from software to help with designs.
The third programme would act as an incubator for start-ups, and he aimed to invest in two projects. ""I am mainly interested in projects that have environmental impact,"" he said, citing the example of a project to turn sewage into fertiliser.
He said was persuaded to work with USEK by the president of the Maronite Christian institution, Father Talal Hachem, and his young team.
Ghosn said he picked USEK, rather than a bigger Lebanese university, because he liked working with an institution that attracted a broad range of students, not just the wealthy. 
""These students need help more than anybody else. This is the class that has been smashed by the situation today,"" he told Reuters. ""I’m going to help build the economy by helping to solve problems that every Lebanese is facing today.""

MADRID (Reuters) - Former IMF chief Rodrigo Rato was acquitted on Tuesday of fraud charges and falsifying accounts after a high profile trial over the IPO of  Bankia , when he was chairman of the Spanish bank.
Rato, who always denied any wrongdoing, resigned as chairman of Bankia in May 2012. He is serving a 4-1/2 year sentence in after being found guilty of embezzlement in a separate trial over the misuse of company credit cards while he was at Bankia.
Another 33 people and entities charged in the trial relating to the bank's ill-fated 2011 listing were also cleared of any charges, a sentence published by Spain's High Court showed.
This included Bankia (MC:BKIA) itself which is in the middle of a merger with Caixabank (MC:CABK).
Rato's lawyer did not reply to a request for comment, while Bankia, which had denied any wrongdoing, declined to comment.
The ruling, almost two years after the trial started, is politically and socially charged as more than 300,000 retail shareholders lost their investments in Bankia, which within a year of its float had to be bailed out by the government.
As part of separate civil proceedings, Bankia has already paid retail investors around 1.9 billion euros ($2.22 billion) in compensation relating to losses they sustained in the IPO. 
In its 442-page ruling, the court said that the financial information included in Bankia's initial public offering (IPO) prospectus was accurate and more than enough for institutional and retail investors to form a reasoned opinion about the value of the bank and that any risks had been well flagged.
Spain's public prosecutor had sought an eight and half years jail sentence for Rato, a former Spanish Economy minister was International Monetary Fund chief between 2004 and 2007. 
Less than a year after Bankia raised 3.1 billion euros in the share offering, it restated a 2011 profit of slightly above 300 million euros with a 3 billion euro loss.
This was done by Bankia's current management team, headed by chairman Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri, who is poised to become chairman of the new combined entity with Caixabank.
During the trial, Rato attributed the accounting changes to writedowns against future losses when the bank changed management rather than to actual losses on his watch and said that the Bank of Spain was aware of his decisions.
Bankia, formed in 2010 from the merger of seven unlisted savings banks, was bailed out in a 22.4 billion euro state rescue in 2012, at the height of Spain's financial crisis.

The average price of a haircut rose by 6.3% on the year in August, despite a July 1 cut in VAT to 16% from 19% and overall consumer prices remaining unchanged last month. For children, the cost rose by 9.4%, for men 6.5% and for women 5.8%.
""One reason is probably the implementation of strict hygiene requirements after the reopening,"" the Statistics Office said. ""For example, dry haircuts may not be offered.""

37,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 06:34AM ET</span>","Election Debate, Virus Deaths and Fed Speakers: What's up in Markets on Tuesday","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com --  Donald Trump and Joe Biden face off, the virus claims its one millionth victim as Mike Pence warns of rising infection numbers, Fed speakers galore - and the Turkish and Russian currencies weaken as their allies square off in the Caucasus. Here's what you need to know in markets on Tuesday, September 29th.
1. Seconds out, round one
Donald Trump and Joe Biden will take part in their first head-to-head debate ahead of the presidential election at 9 PM ET (1700 GMT).
The state of the economy, the handling of the pandemic and issues of racial inequality and law and order are likely to top the bill. One further issue of note is likely to be Trump’s tax records, which were leaked by the New York Times at the weekend.
Opinion polls suggest that at the moment, the election is Biden’s to lose: an average of polls on RealClearPolitics.com put him nearly 7 points ahead nationally. The debates are nonetheless likely to be a severe test of the 77 year-old’s powers of concentration, which Trump has repeatedly flagged as a weakness in his opponent.
2. Covid-19 hits the million milestone
Covid-19 has now officially killed more than 1 million people worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins.
There’s no particular power in such numbers, but markets remain under pressure from signs of rising infections across much of Europe and the U.S.  Vice-President Mike Pence, who argued during the summer that there was no ‘second wave’, said on Monday that Americans should expect case numbers to rise in the coming days. While he put this down to more widespread testing, positivity rates have also risen across much of the Midwest in recent days.
Deaths from the virus rose 40% in England and Wales to their highest in five weeks, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned she might impose tighter restrictions on public gatherings to pre-empt a further surge in infections.
On the brighter side, India – which has been the world’s virus hotspot in recent weeks – posted its lowest level of new infections in nearly a month.
3. Stocks consolidate after big gains
U.S. stock markets are poised to open largely flat ahead of Tuesday’s presidential debate, consolidating after rapid gains over the last two sessions.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), Dow futures and S&P 500 futures were both flat, while NASDAQ futures were down 0.1%.
Markets reacted with skepticism overnight to new proposals from House Democrats for a $2.2 trillion stimulus package for the economy. The numbers remain far above what the Republican-controlled Senate has signalled it will approve.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include chipmaker Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and cruise operator Carnival (NYSE:CUK), both of which release quarterly updates.  Investors will also be on the lookout for more details about Palantir’s IPO. It’s set to start trading on Friday.
4. Fed speakers, consumer confidence, house price data due
The data calendar fills up a bit more today, with updates from the Conference Board on consumer confidence at 10 AM ET, and the S&P/Case-Shiller house price index for July an hour before that.
A raft of speakers from the Federal Reserve will also hit the newswires, starting with New York’s John Williams (NYSE:WMB) at 9:15 AM and ending with bank supervision head Randall Quarles at 3 PM. Influential Vice-Chair Richard Clarida is sandwiched between them at 11:40 AM ET.
European data overnight pointed to persistent weakness in consumer prices in the euro zone in September, which followed an overwhelmingly dovish address to the European parliament by ECB President Christine Lagarde on Monday.  
5. Caucasus fighting hits currencies; oil not so much
Oil prices fell in overnight trading, as a brief rally on geopolitical concerns ran out of steam ahead of the weekly update on U.S. crude stockpiles from the American Petroleum Institute.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), U.S. crude futures were down 0.5% at $40.39 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 0.5% at $42.66 a barrel
The eruption of fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia briefly raised concerns about the security of a 1.2 million barrel-a-day pipeline that takes Azeri crude to the Mediterranean. The two former Soviet republics both have powerful supporters in Turkey and Russia, who exercise considerable influence over both.
While the fighting hasn’t had a durable impact on oil prices, yet, it has hit both the Turkish and Russian currencies, which both fell against the dollar (the Turkish lira hitting another all-time low overnight).

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday he would persist with heavy spending to help Europe's largest economy recover from the coronavirus pandemic as rescue and stimulus measures push debt to its highest level on record.
Speaking to lawmakers to present his draft budget for 2021, he said the government would continue to help companies and consumers by expanding job protection schemes and would keep public investments high.
""With the investments of this budget, we're pushing the door further open for the future of our country,"" Scholz said.
He defended the draft budget, which envisages net new debt of 96.2 billion euros ($112.45 billion) to finance further measures to tackle the coronavirus crisis.
""That's a lot, a lot of money,"" Scholz said, but added that inaction would eventually lead to even higher costs.
The additional borrowing marks the second-highest amount of net new debt since the end of World War Two. The government has already taken on record high borrowing of some 218 billion euros this year.
The fiscal plans, which include investments in climate protection measures such as a national hydrogen plan, require Germany to suspend its constitutionally enshrined debt limits again in 2021 after parliament abandoned them this year.
The overall debt from federal government, regional states, municipalities and social security funds rose to 2.1089 trillion euros in the first half of 2020, the Federal Statistics Office said.
That was an increase of 11%, or 210.1 billion euros, compared to the previous six months. The previous record was set in the second half of 2012.
""The increase is mainly due to the fact that the public budgets borrowed funds for the purpose of financing measures to overcome the coronavirus crisis,"" the office said.
From 2022, Germany plans to stick to its debt brake rules again, limiting borrowing to a tiny fraction of gross domestic product. But Berlin is not planning to return to its ultra-prudent fiscal policy of keeping a balanced budget.

The move is expected to encourage Chinese companies and households to covert their often large foreign currency holdings to yuan and dampen speculative purchases of foreign currencies, analysts said.
Bank of Communications (SS:601328) (HK:3328) said on Saturday that it was lowering interest rates on deposits below $3 million in certain foreign currencies.
The one-year dollar deposit rate at all of China's ""big five"" state banks now stands at 0.35% which compares with levels of 0.75-0.8% previously, according to data from the lenders.
In contrast, the benchmark one-year yuan deposit rate is much higher at 1.5%. Long betting that the yuan would eventually depreciate, Chinese companies and households have heavily invested in foreign currency assets.
Chinese foreign currency deposits stood at $819.5 billion as of end-August, up $25.8 billion from the previous month, and marking the highest level since March 2018. But as overseas economies embark on aggressive monetary easing, cutting rates to zero or negative, foreign capital has flowed into China - the only major economy expected to show growth this year. As a result, the yuan  has appreciated more than 5% against the dollar since late May.

In the Southeast Asian country, President Rodrigo Duterte has been bolstered by establishing a powerful support base on social media platforms like Facebook, a factor that was instrumental in his election victory in 2016. 
But Facebook last week dismantled a network of accounts that originated from China and the Philippines for engaging in ""coordinated inauthentic behaviour"", including one that Manila says it supports for its anti-communism stance. 
The takedown drew the ire of Duterte who warned Facebook on Monday night that it should explain what its purpose is in his country if it wants to continue to operate.
Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque said Duterte would not shut down Facebook, but he wants to understand how it regulates content in the Philippines where 65% percent of its 107 million people are users.
Platforms like Facebook have become political battlegrounds in the Philippines, but the Duterte administration has denied allegations that it has allowed the abuse and manipulation of social media by its supporters to harass or discredit opponents.
Roque also questioned Facebook's partnership with local fact-checkers Rappler and Vera Files, online news organizations that he said were critical of the Duterte government.
""We need new policies to level the playing field on Facebook,"" Roque said, adding Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself has called for regulation of online content.
Facebook and Rappler did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Vera Files declined to comment.
Facebook has been under fire in recent years for its lax approach to fake news reports, state-backed disinformation campaigns and violent content spread on its services, prompting calls for new regulations around the world.

Following such criticism, Zuckerberg had said the company would prioritize ""trustworthy"" news in its feed by identifying high-quality outlets.

Prior to the pandemic, land prices had been making a steady recovery with demand for hotels and other commercial properties particularly strong due to robust tourism and ahead of the now delayed Tokyo Olympics. An increase in demand for offices from companies had also helped.
But commercial land prices slipped 0.3% in the year to July 1, their first decline in five years, the land ministry's annual survey found.
""Land prices related to hotels and shops showed relatively big changes but price changes for many other types of areas were smaller,"" a land ministry official said. 
Residential land prices, which have been declining since 1992 in the wake of the bursting of Japan's bubble economy, accelerated their pace of falls, dropping 0.7% after a 0.1% dip in the previous year.
Land prices are among data closely watched by the Bank of Japan to monitor how its super-loose monetary policy is affecting the economy and asset prices.

43,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 02:29AM ET</span>","Northern California wildfires kill three, force evacuation of thousands","By Adrees Latif and Stephen Lam
SANTA ROSA, Calif. (Reuters) - A northern California wildfire raging in the foothills of the Cascade range has claimed three lives, officials said on Monday, as a separate blaze prompted mass evacuations and spread turmoil to the famed wine-producing regions of Napa and Sonoma counties.
The three fatalities in the so-called Zogg Fire in Shasta County, which erupted on Sunday near Redding, about 200 miles north of San Francisco, were reported by the county sheriff and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire). They were all civilians.
No further details about the victims or how they perished were immediately provided. But the deaths bring to 29 the number of people killed since mid-August in a California wildfire season of historic proportions.
The Zogg fire, which has destroyed 146 structures and charred 31,000 acres of grassy hillsides and oak woodlands thick with dry scrub, coincided with the outbreak of another conflagration in the heart of California's wine country north of the Bay area.
That blaze, dubbed the Glass Fire, has spread across 36,000 acres of similar terrain in Napa and Sonoma counties since early Sunday, incinerating more than 100 homes and other buildings, forcing thousands of residents to flee and threatening world-renowned vineyards, according to CalFire.
Both fires were listed at zero containment as of Monday evening. The cause of each was under investigation.
They marked the latest flashpoints in a destructive spate of wildfires this summer across the Western United States. 
In California this year, wildfires have scorched 3.7 million acres (1.5 million hectares) since January - far exceeding any single year in state history. They have been stoked by intense, prolonged bouts of heat, high winds and other weather extremes that scientists attribute to climate change. 
More than 7,000 homes and other structures have burned statewide so far this year. 
LANDMARK CHATEAU BURNS
The Glass Fire broke out in Napa Valley before dawn near Calistoga before merging with two other blazes into a larger eruption of flames straddling western Napa County and an adjacent swath of Sonoma County.
In one notable property loss, the mansion-like Chateau Boswell winery in St. Helena - a familiar landmark along the Silverado Trail road running the length of the Napa Valley - went up in flames on Sunday night. 
An estimated 60,000 residents have been placed under evacuation orders or advisories in Sonoma and Napa counties combined, but no injuries have been reported.
Not everyone heeded evacuation orders.
As neighbors around him fled, Santa Rosa resident Jas Sihota perched himself on his front porch with a garden hose, darting out every 15 minutes or so to douse nearby spot fires seeded by wind-blown embers under a hazy red sun.
Sihota, a radiology technician at a nearby hospital, said he had not slept in some 24 hours.
""I wouldn't have a house if I didn't stay,"" said Sihota. At least 10 homes elsewhere on the street beyond the reach of his hose were destroyed.
In 2017, roughly 5% of Santa Rosa's homes were lost when downed power lines sparked a devastating firestorm in October that swept the region, killing 19 people.
HARVEST SEASON SMOKE 
The Glass Fire struck about midway through the region's traditional grape-harvesting season, already disrupted by a spate of large fires earlier this summer.
Several Napa Valley growers said recently they would forgo a 2020 vintage altogether due to smoke contamination of ripening grapes waiting to be picked. 
The 475 vintners in Napa Valley alone account for just 4% of the state's grape harvest but half the retail value of all California wines sold. Sonoma County, too, has become a premiere viticulture region with some 450 wineries and a million acres of vineyards.
The full impact on the region's wine business remains to be seen and will differ for each grower, depending on how far along they are in the harvest, said Teresa Wall, spokeswoman for the Napa Valley Vintners trade group. 
""There are some who were close to wrapping up, and some who were still planning to leave their grapes hanging out there for a while,"" she said. 
The fires caused major upheavals for the area's most vulnerable residents already grappling with the coronavirus pandemic. 
The Adventist Health St. Helena hospital was forced to evacuate patients on Sunday, the second time in a month following a lightning-sparked wildfire in August.
On Monday, residents at Oakmont Gardens, a Santa Rosa retirement community, leaned on walkers and waited to board a bus taking them to safety, their face masks doubling as protection against smoke and COVID-19.
Over 100,000 homes and business have suffered power outages across northern California since Sunday, some from precautionary shutoffs of transmission lines to reduce wildfire risks in the midst of extremely windy, hot, dry weather, Pacific Gas and Electric Co reported.

Red-flag warnings for extreme wildfire risks remained posted for much of Northern California, forecasting low humidity and gale-force wind gusts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Income inequality in the United States narrowed in the first three years of the Trump administration as rising wages and a low unemployment rate fueled gains for lower-income and less educated families, according to U.S. Federal Reserve data released on Monday.
Wealth inequality was largely unchanged, with the top 10% of families holding about 71% of family wealth in 2019, roughly the same as in 2016, the Fed found in its latest Survey of Consumer Finances, conducted every three years. 
The survey provides a snapshot of how income, assets and debt are distributed across the population, and in this case how the benefits of the final years of a decade-long economic expansion had begun flowing to typically less advantaged parts of the population.
Median family net worth by race: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/FAMILIES/oakveexnbvr/chart.png
Most of the survey was conducted last year, before the coronavirus pandemic ended that expansion and pushed the United States into a recession that may endanger some of the very gains documented in the report.
But the data did reflect a pause at least in the long trend toward wealth and income becoming more concentrated in the upper end. Overall, for example, average incomes fell, but that was driven by a decline in incomes among the top earners.
Excluding the richest 1% of families, average incomes rose about 3.1% between 2016 and 2019.
The same dynamic was behind the 6% decline in average income for whites, from $133,000 to $122,000. White families are disproportionately represented among the ranks of the top earners, but Fed economists said their incomes can also be more volatile because they are more dependent on the proceeds of private businesses or dividends and gains from asset holdings.
Although the top 10% retained a steady share of wealth, the period did see some reshuffling among the rest of the population.
Those in 25th to 50th percentiles saw wealth gains of 36% over the period, attributed by the Fed to rising rates of home ownership and increased stock holdings. 
While the net worth of those in the bottom quartile also increased, that one-fourth of American families still held just 0.3% of family wealth. 
There were proportionately larger gains in wealth as well for Black and Hispanic families, the Fed said. Median net worth rose 33% for Black families and 65% for Hispanic families, compared with a 3% gain in the median for white families. However the absolute gap remained large: the median net worth for white families, at $188,200, was nearly eight times that of the $24,100 median for Blacks, and over five times that of the $36,100 of Hispanic families.

45,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 11:40PM ET</span>",Explainer: The $4 trillion U.S. government relies on individual taxpayers,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government's over $4 trillion annual budget, the world's largest, relies heavily on individual wage earners whose taxes and retirement benefits are deducted from every paycheck, leaning particularly on the top 20% of income earners.
Corporations pay just a fraction of what individuals do into the federal spending pool, which funds the military, transportation safety, veterans benefits, regulatory agencies and programs like NASA. 
A New York Times investigation https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html published on Sunday shows that President Donald Trump paid just $750 in federal taxes during the years straddling his 2017 inauguration, and none at all for 10 of 15 years before then. Trump dismissed the report as ""fake news.""
Trump reported https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-ethics/trump-owes-lenders-at-least-315-million-disclosure-shows-idUSKBN1972XM income of at least $594 million for 2016 and early 2017 and assets worth at least $1.4 billion, in a financial disclosure in June 2017. 
HOW THE U.S. BUDGET IS FUNDED
Individuals, whether they are self-employed or earn a paycheck from a small business or a giant corporation, foot most of the federal government's bills. 
Individual income tax funds U.S. federal spending: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-TRUMP/TAXES/xlbpgjzwrvq/chart.png
Of the $3.46 trillion in receipts taken in by the U.S. Treasury during fiscal 2019, nearly half came from the $1.72 trillion in individual income taxes collected. 
In addition, $1.24 trillion in Social Security and Medicare taxes were paid by individuals, bringing their share to 85%.
Taxes paid by corporations last year totaled $230 billion, or just 6.6% of the total in 2019. The remainder of federal revenues are made up from customs duties on imported goods, excise taxes such as those on gasoline, estate taxes and other miscellaneous taxes and fees.
WHO PAYS THE MOST?
W2 wage earners - those with a regular paycheck from a business, government entity or non-profit - make up the largest share of tax revenue through income tax and social insurance withholdings, like the payroll tax that funds Social Security, the government retirement program. 
Those withholdings can reduce https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-federal-income-tax-rates-work Americans' take-home pay by nearly 40%, depending on income, and have made up about 73% of total revenue over the past two fiscal years through August. 
Despite high unemployment because of the coronavirus pandemic, withheld income taxes in 2020 have fallen less than 1% from 2019 levels, partly due to higher earnings early in the year and aid to small businesses that kept paychecks coming to many idled employees over the spring and summer months.
Self-employed people, including many business owners, and those paying capital gains or other taxes not withheld from their paychecks, make up the second-largest category, funding around 19% of the total tax revenue during fiscal 2020 through August. 
TAXES BY INCOME LEVEL
The U.S. tax system has been described as ""progressive,"" meaning that the share of taxes paid rises with income, through seven https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-federal-income-tax-rates-work tax brackets. 
The very poorest, those making under $9,875 a year, are taxed at a 10% rate, while the wealthiest, or those making $518,400 and over are taxed at a 37% rate. But what the wealthiest pay is often much lower due to a variety of complicated tax loopholes, which can benefit hedge fund managers, private equity firm partners and real estate investors.
The 2017 tax cuts passed by Republicans and signed by Trump largely kept that relationship intact, but shifted more of the tax burden to wealthy and upper-middle-class wage earners. But income deductions for mortgage interest and state and local taxes paid, the biggest middle-class tax breaks, were reduced considerably. 
A pre-pandemic Congressional Budget Office estimate https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-12/55941-CBO-Household-Income.pdf projected the top 20% would pay 69.7% of federal taxes in 2021. 
U.S. federal taxes paid by income group: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-TRUMP/TAXES/oakpeexxbpr/chart.png
America's 37% top marginal tax rate is lower than the top rates for many wealthy and developing countries, including the OECD average of 41.2%, according to https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/services/tax/tax-tools-and-resources/tax-rates-online/individual-income-tax-rates-table.html KPMG. 
Corporations got a major tax cut in the Republican bill, when their tax rate before deductions was slashed to 21% from 35%.
IS THE UNITED STATES COLLECTING ENOUGH TAX? 
No. Even before the coronavirus pandemic sparked a deep recession this year, the federal budget deficit https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/reports-statements/mts/mts0919.pdf in fiscal 2019 was $984 billion and was forecast in January to top $1 trillion in fiscal 2020, which ends on Wednesday. 
Massive spending to keep businesses and households from collapsing is expected to drive the fiscal 2020 deficit to $3.3 trillion, dwarfing the previous record of $1.4 trillion in 2009 and making up the largest share of gross domestic product since the end of World War Two.

If action is not taken to shrink deficits in future years through spending cuts or tax increases, the CBO has warned that federal debts as a percentage of GDP will double by 2050.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic is expected to lead to the slowest growth in more than 50 years in East Asia and the Pacific as well as China, while up to 38 million people are set to be pushed back into poverty, the World Bank said in an economic update on Monday. 
The bank said the region this year is projected to grow by only 0.9%, the lowest rate since 1967.
Growth in China was expected to come in at 2% this year, boosted by government spending, strong exports and a low rate of new coronavirus infections since March, but held back by slow domestic consumption.
The rest of the East Asia and Pacific region was projected to see a 3.5% contraction, the World Bank said.
The pandemic and efforts to contain its spread led to a ""significant curtailment"" of economic activity, the report said.
""These domestic difficulties were compounded by the pandemic-induced global recession, which hit EAP (East Asia and Pacific) economies that rely on trade and tourism hard,"" it said.
Countries in the region may need to pursue fiscal reform to mobilise revenue in response to the economic and financial impact from the pandemic, while social protection programmes can help support workers' integration back into the economy, the Washington, DC-based bank said.
""Countries with well-functioning social protection programs, and good implementation infrastructure, pre-COVID, have been able to scale up more quickly during the pandemic,"" it said.
The economic shock of the pandemic was also expected to lead to a jump in poverty, defined as income of $5.50 a day, the bank said, adding that based on past experience and the latest gross domestic product forecasts, poverty could expand by 33 million to 38 million people to see its first rise in 20 years.
The bank said that 33 million people who would have in the absence of the pandemic escaped poverty would remain in it this year.
""The region is confronted with an unprecedented set of challenges,"" said Victoria Kwakwa, vice-president for East Asia and the Pacific at the World Bank.
""But there are smart policy options available that can soften these tradeoffs - such as investing in testing and tracing capacity and durably expanding social protection to cover the poor and the informal sector.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British home prices will rise 2.0% this year following a post-lockdown boom in the housing market, according to a Reuters poll, marking a sharp turnaround in views from a 5.0% fall predicted three months ago.
Britain's economy shrank more than 20% in the second quarter after the government forced businesses to close and citizens to stay home, but it is expected to rebound with 15.8% growth this quarter as some restrictions have been relaxed. 
The lockdown meant people spent more time indoors and a dash for larger homes and gardens pushed up prices in September, a survey by property website Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY) showed last week.
That chimed with other surveys that have shown a post-lockdown surge in the market, also helped by a temporary cut in property tax. 
Prices will rise 2.0% this year, the Sept. 15-25 poll of 22 property experts showed, but stagnate next year after the tax break finishes and due to an expected spike in unemployment following the closure of the government's furlough scheme.
""Those who have been hit medically or financially by COVID-19 will have bigger issues to worry about than moving for a bigger garden,"" said property market consultant Henry Pryor.
""We may well run out of a pool of buyers prepared and able to move for lifestyle reasons as the flood of negative headlines about the true cost of the pandemic to individuals and the nation starts to become clearer.""
When asked about the risk of the recent surge in prices reversing by the end of the year, respondents were split, with nine saying it was high, seven saying it was low and three saying very low. None said it was very high.
""Sellers are achieving a record share of their asking price, and while this metric isn't directly correlated with house price growth, it points towards a strong market where price falls are unlikely,"" said Aneisha Beveridge at estate agents Hamptons International.
However nearly 80%, or 14 of 18, analysts who responded to an additional question said the risk to their forecasts was to the downside. In a worst case scenario prices will be flat this year - albeit very different to the 11.0% median fall given in June - and fall 3.3% in 2021.
Prices in London, long a hotbed for foreign investors, will flatline this year but recover 1.0% next year and rise 3.3% in 2022. In a worst case they will fall 1.0% this year and 5.0% next, the poll showed.
""London is the only part of the UK where house prices are not rising and affordability has crept in,"" said Tony Williams (NYSE:WMB) at property consultancy Building Value.
When asked to describe the level of house prices in the capital on a scale of 1 to 10 from extremely cheap to extremely expensive, the median response was 8. Nationally it was 6.
Another distraction for forecasters is that Britain's transition period after leaving the European Union is due to expire at the end of December and talks about the future trading relationship have so far proved fractious.
Twelve of 19 respondents to another question said recent tensions between the two sides would have little impact on housing market activity. Seven said it would slow activity and none said it would get a boost.
""I doubt the tensions surrounding negotiations will have much of an impact,"" said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""But if they result in a no-deal Brexit in 2021, with all the potential adverse consequences this would mean for the economy, that would be a different matter.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - When Lau Kai Fai, his wife and teenage son moved into a new Hong Kong flat last month, he thought the 290 square feet (27 square metres) of space in his ""module home"" felt like ""winning the lottery.""
Among the first Hong Kongers to move into such prefabricated dwellings, built as a transition for people awaiting public housing, Lau's family more than tripled the space they had squeezed into. Now they sit together for meals, rather than eating in turns.
While tiny by the standards of many cities in rich countries, the new home represents a big step up - even if temporary - for Lau, 70, in one of the most crowded urban areas in the world.
""It feels like a home,"" Lau said. ""The previous flat was only a place to sleep.""
Lau is the beneficiary of Hong Kong's latest initiative to ease a housing shortage, where more than 200,000 people living in subdivided flats are waiting an average 5.5 years to get public housing.
Transitional homes are built on idle land leased by the government or private developers for only a few years, although the prefab modules can be moved and reused.
The 2018 plan only scratches the surface of the needs of one of the world's most unequal cities: more than 1 million of the 7.5 million people in this opulent financial hub live in poverty. As of June, 800 transitional homes had been built of 15,000 planned over the next three years.
But for the Lau family, the flat in a four-storey building in one of the oldest and poorest districts in central Kowloon is luxury.
HOMEWORK AT DESK, NOT BED
Their previous flat, one of many in Hong Kong dubbed ""coffin homes,"" had cost around HK$5,000 ($650) a month in rent. Now the family pays HK$3,000 - 25% of the income of the retired Lau's wife, Tian Jiayu, the family breadwinner who works in a supermarket.
They finally have a place where their son does his homework at a desk rather than in bed.
The door to the white, container-shaped dwelling opens onto a bunk bed. A wardrobe separates the bed from the living room, where a rotating chair doubles for computer work and dining. Twelve steps from the entrance, at the end of the flat, stands the mini-kitchen with a refrigerator, stoves and washer.
The move expanded the family's floor space from 80 sq ft to 290 sq ft. They now live in two-thirds the median area of a home in crowded Hong Kong, at 430 sq ft - itself half the size of the average London home.
In Tokyo, another packed Asian capital, the average home is 710 sq ft, although some 1.4 million people live in spaces of 210 sq ft or less, according to government figures.
Tian is happiest about the upgrade to mini-kitchen from gas stove.
The land for Nan Cheong 2020, the city's first module home project, was leased by developer Henderson Land (OTC:HLDCY) for HK$1 a month. The project was built by the Hong Kong Council of Social Service.
It was built from container-like blocks for only 40% of the cost of building a public rental home, said Anthony Wong, business director of the nonprofit.
Lack of land and money are challenges to building more transitional homes. NGOs say the government is not doing enough. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam is under pressure for housing solutions, including shoring up the transitional housing scheme.
""The problem is the government is acting like a middle man rather than taking the responsibility to develop it. They are relying on NGOs and developers to do that,"" said Sze Lai Shan, community organizer at the Society for Community Organisation.
A spokesman for the Transport and Housing Bureau told Reuters the government launched a HK$5 billion funding scheme in June to support transitional housing projects by NGOs, which can come in many different arrangements and different ideas.
“We hope to ... allow different community groups to use their creativity as much as possible to provide diversified transitional housing projects,” he said by email, adding the government is facilitating short- and long-term ""policies to increase housing supply, in order to address housing problem faced by low-income families.""
Lau's Nan Cheong 2020 lifeline is two years.
""We hope we'll get a public flat by then, if not there’s nothing we can do,"" he said. ""We’ll have to find a subdivided flat again.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Some Bank of Japan board members called for a review of the central bank's policy strategy as the economic shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic pushes inflation further away from its target, a summary of opinions from a September meeting showed.
Those views underline the increasingly tough position the BOJ finds itself in, as inflation had failed to gain momentum even before the coronavirus ravaged Japan's economy. 
A few of the board members said the central bank may need to find a new approach to fire up inflation toward its 2% target, given the pandemic's sweeping impact on companies and households.
""As economic developments change rapidly, it's becoming hard to foresee inflation reaching our target. It's thus necessary to conduct again a comprehensive examination of our strategy for achieving the price goal,"" one member said.
""We may need to debate the appropriate monetary policy path from the perspective of how to balance the need to contain the pandemic and keep the economy alive,"" according to another opinion shown in the summary.
Some others said the BOJ must act ""promptly"" and in close cooperation with the government if the pandemic's scars deepen, according to the summary released on Tuesday.
The BOJ kept policy steady in September and offered a slightly more upbeat view of the economy than in July, suggesting that no immediate expansion of stimulus was needed.
But BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said the central bank would work closely with new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's administration to shield the economy from the broadening fallout of the pandemic, including by loosening policy further.

The BOJ releases a summary of opinions voiced by its board member roughly a week after its rate review. It does not disclose the identity of the members who voiced the views.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Australian housing market activity won't recover from the recent slowdown for at least a year as dwindling household incomes and soaring unemployment hammer demand, causing home prices to fall this year and next, a Reuters poll of analysts showed.
Now in its first recession in three decades, Australia's economy is expected to recover slowly even though the spread of the coronavirus is largely under control and most businesses have reopened. Still, policymakers expect unemployment to rise to about 10% from 6.8% in August.
That forecast comes despite aggressive monetary policy easing from the Reserve Bank of Australia, which has so far chopped its key interest rate to an all-time low of 0.25% and launched a bond-buying campaign to hold market yields down.
The Sept. 16-28 poll of 12 property analysts showed average home prices would fall 4.5% this year and another 2.8% next. The market is forecast to recover 3.4% in 2022. All of these were slightly milder predictions than in the Reuters poll in June.
""The deterioration in household income will be the biggest driver of weakness, but elevated uncertainty, much lower population growth and weak investor appetite given the slump in the rental market will all weigh on house prices,"" said Felicity Emmett, senior economist at ANZ.
""Government support and the deferral of home loan repayments have undoubtedly helped support the market. But with unemployment likely to continue to rise and fiscal stimulus to shrink in Q4, prices are likely to continue to decline.""
Six of the 10 property analysts who answered an additional question said activity in the Australian housing market would take at least a year to recover from the recent slowdown.
In a worst-case scenario, the median forecast of a slightly smaller sample showed a 5.0% decline in house prices this year and next, with forecasts ranging from -6.0% to as low as -15.0%.
Asked which was a greater risk for the Australian housing market over the coming year, all but one of six analysts said a sharp economic slowdown.
""We believe house prices will face downward pressure nationwide, as supportive factors will be outweighed by the impact of the change in net immigration,"" wrote Ben McCarthy at Fitch Ratings in a note. 
""Immigration had already been slowing prior to the outbreak of the pandemic, but has plunged since the health crisis led to strict controls on international travel."" 
A regional breakdown of the poll data showed Sydney and Melbourne, which contribute about 43% to the country's gross domestic product, were forecast to decline 2.0% and 7.0% in 2020, respectively, sliding again by nearly 4.0% in 2021.
""The impact of closed borders on immigration, which has helped fuel the housing market, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne in recent decades, will be significant,"" said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital.

""Home prices are expected to fall by around 10%-15% from their April high. Melbourne is particularly at risk on this front, as its 'Stage 4' lockdown has pushed more businesses and households to the brink.""

WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Monday questioned California Governor Gavin Newsom's plan to require all new passenger vehicle sales in 2035 be zero-emission models, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the plan ""raises serious questions regarding its legality and practicality"" and said it could cause problems for the state's electrical grid.
He also declared the move could be subject to federal approval, saying it ""may require California to request a waiver to U.S. EPA.""
The EPA in 2019 issued rules barring California from requiring the sale of electric vehicles; a court challenge is pending.
Wheeler's exchange with Democratic-led California comes as Republican President Donald Trump seeks to win votes in Midwestern auto manufacturing states in the Nov. 3 presidential contest.
California's 2035 clean car move, the most significant yet by a U.S. state aimed at ending the use of gasoline-burning internal combustion engines, clashes with Trump's pro-fossil fuel policies.
California accounts for about 11% of all U.S. vehicle sales, and many states adopt its green vehicle mandates.
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) must write binding regulations to implement the 2035 goal.
Newsom did not immediately comment.
In the letter, Wheeler held up the state's recent rolling blackouts as evidence that its power grid could not support the ambitious plan, which would require millions more cars to run on electricity.
""California’s record of rolling blackouts – unprecedented in size and scope – coupled with recent requests to neighboring states for power begs the question of how you expect to run an electric car fleet that will come with significant increases in electricity demand, when you can’t even keep the lights on today,"" Wheeler wrote.
California on two days last month imposed rolling blackouts on about 400,000 customers during an oppressive heat wave.

The state’s grid operator blamed outages on a gas plant suddenly dropping offline, low wind power and a lack of imported electricity from other states due to scorching temperatures across the West.

In a letter to Democratic lawmakers released by Pelosi's office, she said the legislation ""includes new funding needed to avert catastrophe for schools, small businesses, restaurants, performance spaces, airline workers and others.""
""Democrats are making good on our promise to compromise with this updated bill,"" she said. ""We have been able to make critical additions and reduce the cost of the bill by shortening the time covered for now.""
Pelosi in recent days has said she thinks a deal can be reached with the White House on a new coronavirus relief package and that talks were continuing. But she also said that she would offer legislation if the impasse continued with the Trump administration over the size and shape of another relief package.
She did not say when there would be a vote on the latest Democratic proposal.
Formal talks among Pelosi, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows aimed at hammering out a relief package broke down on Aug. 7 with the two sides far apart.
Pelosi and Mnuchin spoke by phone on Sunday and again on Monday. They plan to speak again on Tuesday morning, her spokesman said. 
Pelosi and Schumer initially sought a $3.4 trillion relief package, then said some time ago they were willing to scale that back by at least a trillion dollars. But it was not clear whether the White House would consider the $2.2 trillion sum proposed in the new legislation. Meadows has said that Trump would be willing to sign a $1.3 trillion relief package.
Pelosi also faces pressure from moderate House Democrats who say they want to see bipartisan aid proposals that have a chance of becoming law.
The new proposal included $436 billion for state and local governments, as well as money for education, testing, airline industry workers and for a small business loan program known as the Paycheck Protection Program, a statement from House Democrats said.

It would also provide a new round of direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per taxpayer and restore federal unemployment benefits of $600 a week through January.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's government on Monday detailed how it would pay for a new minimum income program called Renda Cidada, with President Jair Bolsonaro and Economy Minister Paulo Guedes still pledging to honor the country's spending cap and fiscal rules.
The proposed program would replace Bolsa Familia, the successful flagship welfare program of former Workers Party President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, which pays women a stipend on the condition that they send their children to school and has been credited with reducing poverty in Brazil.
Renda Cidada, which translates as ""Citizen Income,"" would draw from funds already dedicated to Bolsa Familia, as well as from an education fund called Fundeb, said Senator Márcio Bittar, speaking on the sidelines of a meeting between top officials at Bolsonaro's official residence.
At the same meeting, Guedes said the aim was for the new program to begin on Jan. 1, just as emergency pandemic payments to the poor are set to end.
While Bolsonaro had previously given free reign to Guedes on economic policy, the president's backing of big spending to support the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic has led to tensions with Guedes, who favors fiscal discipline.
Renda Cidada is a new version of a planned social welfare programme called Renda Brasil that Bolsonaro cancelled earlier this month after it received waves of bad press over a two-year freeze on pensions and payments for disabled people. Guedes said the policy had been misrepresented and he had never called on cuts for the poor, sick or vulnerable.
Paying for Renda Cidada will involve an accounting maneuver allowing the government to tap into 55 billion reais ($9.7 billion) in the budget earmarked for future debt payments.
""This would put the federal government in the same situation as local states and municipalities: accumulation of unpaid debt,"" said a senior trader at a bank in Sao Paulo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""It ... raises concerns over accounting manipulation and does not change the country's underlying fiscal condition.""
Brazilian markets reacted negatively to the news, amid fears of looser fiscal policy. The real closed down 1.46% at 5.64 per dollar, the stock market fell 2.3%, and longer-term interest rates spiked sharply higher.

56,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 06:20PM ET</span>",EU and Britain far apart as key week of Brexit talks begins,"By Jan Strupczewski, John Chalmers and Elizabeth Piper
BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union and Britain both said a post-Brexit deal was still some way off and differences persisted on Monday over putting in place their earlier divorce deal as they began a decisive week of talks in Brussels.
Britain left the EU last January and is locked in negotiations on a new trade deal from 2021, as well as on implementing the divorce, as set out in the Withdrawal Agreement, especially on the sensitive Irish border.
EU national leaders will assess the state of play at a summit next month, with a no-deal Brexit still possible.
Negotiations have stumbled over fisheries, fair competition and settling disputes, and Brexit descended into fresh chaos this month when London proposed draft laws that would undermine the earlier agreement.
""The UK's positions are far apart from what the EU can accept, a deputy head of the bloc's executive Commission, Maros Sefcovic, said on Monday after talks with Michael Gove, the minister handling the divorce deal.
""We maintain that the bill, if adopted in its current form, would constitute an extremely serious violation of ... the Withdrawal Agreement and of international law,"" he said, urging speedy progress before he meets Gove again in mid-October.
Gove said the clauses of the Internal Market Bill that undercut the Withdrawal Treaty would remain.
""We want to make sure that the Withdrawal Agreement is implemented in full,"" Gove told reporters. ""But those clauses are there, they're in legislation ... And those clauses will remain in that bill.""
TRADE TALKS
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said in London that Britain's focus was on progress in trade talks.
""Although the last two weeks of informal talks have been relatively positive there remains much to be done,"" he said.
""We simply want the standard free trade agreement ... we continue to be asked to accept provisions that do not reflect the reality of our status as an independent country.""
Trade talks resume in Brussels on Tuesday. Lasting until Friday morning and also due to cover energy links and transport, they are the final round of negotiations scheduled so far. 
EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday are expected to authorise more talks before their next summit on Oct. 15-16. They will then assess whether to try push a deal over the line or prepare for the most damaging Brexit at the end of the year. 
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told reporters at a news conference in Lisbon late on Monday that a post-Brexit deal was still possible, saying the EU was ""working hard"" on it.
""Our economies, on both sides of the Channel, were severely hit by the pandemic and we should do everything possible to find an agreement that is manageable so we do not increase the negative impact on our economies,"" she said.
The EU says negotiators must seal an agreement by the end of October or early November, to leave time for ratification by the European Parliament and some national parliaments in the EU so that it can take effect from 2021 when Britain's standstill transition ends after Brexit.

Otherwise, the delicate peace on the island of Ireland as well as an estimated trillion euros worth of annual EU-UK trade would be at risk as the sides would fall back on general World Trade Organization rules that include tariffs and quotas.

The U.K. prime minister will announce a package of measures to provide support for ongoing vocational education so employees and people who are out of work can retrain and gain new skills.
More than 700,000 people have already lost their jobs as a result of coronavirus restrictions and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said last week he expects the “tragedy” of unemployment to affect many more as the U.K. economy is crimped by the pandemic and government support is withdrawn.
“As the Chancellor has said, we cannot, alas, save every job. What we can do is give people the skills to find and create new and better jobs,” Johnson will say in a speech on Tuesday, according to extracts released by his office. “We’re transforming the foundations of the skills system so that everyone has the chance to train and retrain.”

The unemployment rate, already at over 4%, is expected to rise further as a job subsidy scheme put in place early in the pandemic expires next month to be replaced by a scaled-back job support programme.
""We cannot, alas, save every job. What we can do is give people the skills to find and create new and better jobs,"" Johnson will say in a speech, according to excerpts sent by his office.
""We're transforming the foundations of the skills system so that everyone has the chance to train and retrain.""
The measures will include funding to allow adults without qualifications to take certain college courses without paying fees, as well as flexible loans allowing people to space out their study and transfer credits between colleges.
The government will also seek to boost the number of apprenticeships, with more funding for small and medium firms taking on apprentices, and will extend a pilot programme known as digital skill boot camps to new locations.
The number of people doing vocational training has been falling over the past two decades, the government said, adding that 10% of adults in Britain held a higher technical qualification as their highest qualification, compared with 20% in Germany and 34% in Canada.

British businesses have complained for a long time of a shortage of skills in the workforce, and the country's productivity has persistently been lower than in some comparable economies.

59,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 04:45PM ET</span>","Trump's reported tax methods would be par for the course for the rich, experts say","By Tom Bergin
(Reuters) - President Donald Trump has denied an expose by The New York Times saying he effectively paid no income tax for most of the past two decades, but experts said the methods it was reported he employed to reduce his bill are commonly used by wealthy property developers to file zero-liability tax returns.
In addition to real estate tax breaks, Trump could also benefit from a broad flexibility available to the super-rich to report personal expenses, such using their own private jets and holiday homes, as deductible business costs, they say.
“It would be very common for my wealthier clients in the world of real estate to report losses or to break even,” said Robert Keebler who runs a tax advisory firm in Green Bay, Wisconsin, which serves high net worth clients.
“It’s not something cooked up in some law firm, it’s something Congress devised,” he said of the tax breaks enjoyed by the real estate sector and investors with capital gains.
Real estate investors are allowed to deduct around 4% of the purchase value of their buildings from their rental income each year, even though buildings do not usually drop in value. This means they can report tax losses while earning fat profits. 
Tax campaigners have long argued the tax break was a giveaway not needed to spur real estate investment and should be abolished.
Outside of the real estate sector, or in cases of real estate tycoons whose buildings no longer offer big depreciation deductions – something the Times said might apply to Trump -- it is a maneuver that becomes more difficult to achieve.
“Wealthy people for the most part pay taxes,” said Annette Nellen, professor of tax at the College of Business, San Jose State University. She said that if Trump did not enjoy big depreciation deductions -- applied against his earnings from his TV show ""The Apprentice"" and licensing his name to developers around the world -- it would have been difficult to pay no tax whatsoever.
“You would think he had some income to pay taxes on,” she added.
The White House did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment
In a series of Twitter posts, the Republican president responded on Monday to the New York Times report. ""I paid many millions of dollars in taxes but was entitled, like everyone else, to depreciation & tax credits,"" he wrote.
The United States has not published individuals' tax returns since a brief period in the 1920s so it is impossible to know how much wealthy people typically pay in tax. 
The tax records published in 2012 by then presidential candidate Mitt Romney were a rare insight into the tax affairs of the wealthy. 
The documents revealed he paid an effective federal tax rate of 14% on $14 million of income. That result was largely because of the low tax rate applied to capital gains and dividends – something successive governments had confirmed in the hope that it may stoke business creation-- but not aided by the business structure or potential deductions someone like Trump enjoys.
In his financial disclosures since 2016, Trump has reported gains from selling shares and land. Trump has not released his tax documents, bucking a decades-old tradition for U.S. presidential candidates to make their returns public.
Beyond his real estate dealings, another way Trump was reported to reduce his tax bill was by putting personal expenses through his businesses and designating a family estate outside New York City as a business. 
Experts said it was not uncommon for wealthy business owners to claim holiday homes or hobby farms were businesses whose running costs should be offset against other income, or that private jet flights for weekends away in Miami were business expenses.
“They are not alone. We see court cases on this in the U.S. every year,” Nellen said.
However, experts said it was impossible to know the extent to which Trump’s zero tax bill was due to generous breaks, tax avoidance – the bending of tax rules to pay less than the law intended – or the fact that he simply did not have a big income across the years involved.
At least several of Trump’s properties have been loss-making in recent years, published accounts and property tax records show. A 2016 Reuters examination of his golf courses found that Trump had invested around $1 billion building a portfolio of assets which were worth as little as half that value. 
https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/trump-golf
Trump disputed that estimate.

The Times said Trump was coming under increasing financial pressure due to ongoing losses at some of his businesses and with debt repayments coming due over the next few years.

(Reuters) - While the U.S. economy has seen improvement in areas that benefit from low interest rates, such as housing, there are areas that will take longer to rebound and that will depend on the coronavirus, Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester said Monday. 
For example, some people are able to work at home and there has been an increase in auto sales. But industries in the service sector, including restaurants, small businesses and others that require face-to-face interaction, are lagging, Mester said. 
""It's almost like a tale of two cities,"" Mester said while answering questions during a webinar organized by the African American Chamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania. ""You have a lot of the economy now where activity is picking up, but you have a great part of the economy - travel, leisure and hospitality - where you're not seeing a pickup. I think that's going to continue for some time."" 
Mester said she expects the economy could end the year with the unemployment rate between 7% and 8%. Inflation could end the year above 1% but still well below the Fed's 2% target, Mester told reporters. ""So it's still far from both of our goals, I'd say, for both employment and inflation,"" Mester said. 
Monetary policy will remain accommodative for some time to support the economy through the ""fragile"" recovery. Low interest rates are also in line with the Fed's new framework, which puts more emphasis on closing shortfalls in employment and letting inflation run modestly above 2% for some time. 

The Fed's asset purchases are also providing accommodation and further changes to the program will depend on how the economy goes, Mester said. ""I think right now we're well calibrated,"" she said. ""I think monetary policy is doing what it should.""

62,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 03:27PM ET</span>",Trump Team Weighs Tough New Sanctions on Iran’s Financial Sector,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is considering fresh sanctions to sever Iran’s economy from the outside world except in limited circumstances, by targeting more than a dozen banks and labeling the entire financial sector off-limits, three people familiar with the matter said.
The move would effectively leave Iran -- which has seen its economy crushed by the loss of oil sales and most other trade thanks to existing American restrictions -- isolated from the global financial system, slashing the few remaining legal linkages it has and making it more dependent on informal or illicit trade.
The proposed sanctions would have two objectives, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal deliberations: close one of the few remaining financial loopholes allowing Iran’s government to earn revenue, and stymie Democrat Joe Biden’s promise to re-enter a 2015 nuclear deal if he wins the presidency in November.
The proposal is still under review and hasn’t been sent to President Donald Trump.
Under the plan, the administration would designate the Iranian financial sector under Executive Order 13902, which Trump signed in January to clamp down on mining, construction and other industries. That would not only affect banks, but also remittance processors, money-changers and the informal transfer system used frequently in the Muslim world known as hawala.
Then the administration would blacklist roughly 14 banks in Iran that have so far escaped some U.S. restrictions, under authorities designed to punish entities associated with terrorism, ballistic-missile development and human-rights abuses.
Why U.S., Other Powers Differ on Iran Nuclear Deal: QuickTake
The sanctions under consideration initially got a chilly reception from several Trump officials for fear they could complicate the provision of international humanitarian assistance to Iran, which has been hard hit by the Covid-19 outbreak and existing U.S. sanctions. But they’ve since gained more support amid a broad push from hardliners inside and outside the administration and a belief that it would be possible to mitigate the humanitarian costs, chiefly through so-called comfort letters from the Treasury Department, the people said.
A spokesperson from the Treasury Department declined to comment, as did press officials from the National Security Council and the State Department.
Mark Dubowitz, the president of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who has closely advised the Trump administration on Iran policy, floated the idea in an Aug. 25 editorial in the Wall Street Journal, arguing that protections already exist for humanitarian aid. Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton, who have helped push Trump to take some of the harshest actions against Iran so far, are also in favor.
How Iran’s Virus Fight Is Tied to Struggle With U.S.: QuickTake
“It has a major chilling effect on any financial entities considering doing business with Iran,” Dubowitz said in an interview. “This action would turn Iran’s financial sector radioactive.”
The move has an additional goal: embed sanctions on Iran now so that if Biden wins the election he will find it much harder to re-enter the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. The JCPOA in 2015 gave Iran sanctions relief in exchange for limits on its nuclear program. Trump left the pact in 2018 and has reimposed a raft of sanctions, but Biden has said he would look to re-enter some sort of deal if he wins.
In a Sept. 13 CNN editorial, Biden said he would re-enter the agreement provided Iran also returned to compliance. He called the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran a failure and said the nation is closer to a nuclear weapon now than it was when Trump came to office -- despite a series of sanctions that choked its oil exports and other sectors, along with individuals.
Advocates for the new sanctions argue that the measures would be difficult to unwind because a Biden administration would need to show that Iran was no longer doing work connected to missile proliferation or terrorism. The sanctions would also add to reluctance from companies looking to weigh the risks of doing business with Iran against any potential gains.
U.S. Issues New Iran Sanctions as Others Reject Move at UN
Critics of the hardline approach say Iran is already so heavily sanctioned that one more set of restrictions won’t make much difference. Indeed, the administration introduces new sanctions against Iran on a near daily basis, including Thursday, when the Treasury Department designated two Iranian judges under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.
Despite all those moves, the Iranian regime has so far remained defiant and refused to meet with Trump officials. The U.S. has also grown increasingly isolated at the United Nations Security Council, where 13 of 14 other countries on the panel -- including several U.S. allies -- have rejected its bid to reimpose, or snap back, restrictions targeting Iran’s nuclear program.
“I’m very skeptical that there’s anything they could do at this stage that would change perceptions,” said Jarrett Blanc, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former State Department coordinator for Iran nuclear implementation under President Barack Obama. “If Joe Biden believes that it’s in the U.S. national interest to return to the JCPOA and the sanctions posture that implies, he’ll do it.”
Blanc said the remaining Iranian banks are still important for humanitarian operations and the amount of unsanctioned trade taking place is too small to make much of a difference to Iran’s economy.
‘Malign Activities’
The new proposal has also been taken up by Republican lawmakers who believe the best way to get them passed is by appealing directly to Trump. In a Sept. 17 letter, Cruz, Cotton and four other senators urged Trump to impose the sanctions and cut the banks off from the SWIFT financial messaging system. A group of 57 Congressmen followed with a near identical letter on Thursday.
“Iran’s desperate economic circumstances provide a critical opportunity for the United States to force the regime to abandon its malign activities and return to the negotiating table on your terms,” both letters said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The cost to Brazil's government of servicing its ballooning domestic debt fell to an all-time low in August, official figures showed on Monday, following the drop in official interest rates and a dramatic shortening of the debt profile.
The average cost of servicing the wider public debt load fell to its lowest in a year, Treasury figures showed, as the average interest rate on debt issued in the 12 months to August also fell to the lowest on record.
The average rate of interest on the domestic federal debt stock fell to 7.3% in August from 7.4% in July, the Treasury said, while the average cost of servicing the wider federal public debt load fell to 8.54% from 8.73%. 
The average rate of interest on new domestic debt issued in the 12 months to August fell to 4.85% from 5.13% in the 12 months to July, Treasury said. Barely four years ago, this figure stood at 14.5%.
The Brazilian interest rate curve has steepened sharply in recent weeks, with short-term borrowing costs anchored by the central bank lowering its benchmark Selic rate to a record low of 2.00%, and growing worries over Brazil's fiscal outlook pushing up longer-term rates.
Treasury Secretary Bruno Funchal told Reuters last week that the curve steepening was a ""warning"" that Brazil has ""no room for error"" in getting its record debt and deficit back under control. 
As investors cut back on risk and lend to Brazil for shorter time frames, the average maturity of new domestic debt issued in the 12 months to August fell to a new all-time low of 2.36 years from 3.15 years in July, Treasury figures showed.
At the end of last year, that was over 4 years.
Brazil's overall public debt rose 1.56% in August to 4.41 trillion reais ($768 billion) from the month before, while the total domestic debt stock rose 1.35% to 4.18 trillion reais, Treasury said.

The central bank's new approach to monetary policy, unveiled last month, also puts more emphasis on closing shortfalls in employment, including disparities between racial groups.

66,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 01:40PM ET</span>","U.S. must stand up to China if Biden wins, focus less on trade, Krugman says","By Isabel Versiani
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Democratic candidate Joe Biden should maintain a tough stance against China if he wins the U.S. presidential election, but focus more on industrial policy than trade tariffs, according to Nobel-prize winning economist Paul Krugman.
A fiery critic of the Trump administration who writes a column for the New York Times, Krugman said the dispute over Chinese technology giant Huawei, whose U.S. operations have been severely curtailed by Washington, will remain a bone of contention between the two powers no matter who wins the White House. 
""The U.S.-China situation is complicated. On the one hand, the U.S. has genuine complaints; on the other, there is very little support for Trump's trade war,"" Krugman said in an emailed interview with Reuters.
""So what Biden should probably do is continue to face up to China, but in a different way. Focus more on industrial policy and bring other countries on board to join the effort,"" he said.
If Donald Trump is re-elected, the relationship between the two countries will be ""very bad,"" Krugman said.
The Trump administration imposed staggered tariffs on more than $370 billion in Chinese goods in 2018 and 2019, arguing China was stealing intellectual property and forcing U.S. companies to transfer technology for access to China's markets.
China imposed its own retaliatory tariffs. 
On the U.S. economy, Krugman said the biggest challenges in addition to the near-term uncertainty fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic are structural changes in the demand for labor, and secular stagnation.
""We still have savings exceeding investment demand, leading to low interest rates and a limited ability to respond to slowdowns,"" he said, adding that this should be met with infrastructure investment.
Krugman also said he is worried about the fiscal situation in emerging economies, especially Turkey. He said the growing ability of many emerging market economies to borrow in local currency, rather than dollars, had eased access to credit.
""But emerging countries still have a lot less fiscal space than rich countries, at a time when deficit spending is essential,"" he said.

Krugman also said the path of the U.S.-Latin America relationship in the years ahead is unclear, but suggested the region will remain low on Washington's agenda regardless of outcome on Nov. 3.

LONDON (Reuters) - Financial markets roared into the second half of the year in full-throttle comeback mode. The only problem was that the coronavirus came back too.
The pandemic never really went away of course, but as the charts below show, up until a few weeks ago investors seemed happy to ride the rebound without too much worry about second waves of infection.
Fuelled by over $20 trillion of global stimulus and super-charged tech stocks, MSCI's world stocks index (MIWD00000PUS) piled on 14% over July and August to reclaim the record highs it surrendered in February when COVID first spiralled.
Oil (LCOc1) gained a further 10%, August saw sustained moves out of government bond and gold  bolt holes (US10YT=RR) (DE10YT=RR), video app Zoom (O:ZM) kept zooming and even the world's poorest countries were on a tear in debt markets.
Then September came!
Renewed lockdowns from Melbourne to Madrid compounded concerns that the marauding rally had overshot as rallies often do. World stocks shuddered, giving back over 8% in three weeks, and led down for once by the big tech titans. 
""People just got a bit complacent in August watching all the tech stocks march higher without too much of a thought,"" said IG's chief market analyst, Chris Beauchamp. ""It just needed a decent correction, and that is exactly what we got."" 
Apple (O:AAPL) and Amazon (O:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG), Facebook (O:FB), Netflix (O:NFLX) and Tesla (O:TSLA) all took double-digit dunkings that wobbled the rest of the ""risk"" complex from corporate debt to EM currencies.
Europe's bank stocks slumped back to an all time low, while Argentina's freshly-restructured government bonds lost a quarter of their value to score the worst relaunch into markets since Greece in 2012.

$1.5 BILLION AN HOUR
The quarter as a whole still looks broadly positive though. World stocks are up roughly 6%, the FANGS 28%, oil 2%, Italy's bonds nearly 8% despite 160% debt-to-GDP, and stocks in the least developed 'frontier' countries have jumped 9%. 
A seesawing of major currencies has also happened. The safe-haven dollar (=USD) was down 10% from March up until the September wobble. It is still down over 3% for Q3, which will be its worst since mid 2017, but this month it is up 3%.
""You had such a big fall in the dollar, 5% (in July) in just a few weeks..So this rebound is people stepping back a bit,"" said Francois Savary, Chief Investment Officer of Prime Partners. ""But I think it is purely a short-term phenomenon.""
For now though it has meant more pain in emerging markets.
Brazil's real  is down nearly 30% for the year. Russia's rouble  - one of last year's top performers - is down 16% and 9% in Q3 despite a near bullet-proof balance sheet. Turkey's record low lira  has fallen a further 12% this quarter while Mexico's peso  and South Africa's rand  are down 14% and 20% for the year despite calmer Q3s.
With global central banks hoovering up bonds at a rate of $1.5 billion per hour according to BofA analysts, life has remained good in debt markets. 
Italy's 10% bond returns have been helped by a super-sized COVID rescue plan, Suriname's bonds have made 33.5% as its fears of default have eased, while even hyperinflation-hit Venezuela has jumped 19%, albeit still only to 12 cents on the dollar.

WHEN SEPTEMBER ENDS
A breakdown of the best- and worst-performing stocks also tells the story of the coronavirus pandemic, which has now claimed nearly a million lives and sent unemployment soaring. 
Malaysian rubber glove maker Supermax (KL:SUPM) and Korean pharmaceutical firm Shin Poong (KS:019170) have both rocketed more than 1,000%.
The boom in video chat has lifted Zoom (O:ZM) 630%,  Moderna  (O:MRNA), one of the drug firms in the race for a vaccine, is up over 250%, while sit-on-your-sofa stocks like Netflix (O:NFLX) and Amazon (O:AMZN) have jumped 49% and 67% respectively. 
At the other end, cruise ship company Carnival (N:CCL) has sunk 70%, scores of airlines, travel firms and retailers have been battered while aero engine maker Rolls Royce (L:RR) has been pummelled 45% this quarter and nearly 80% for the year.
And there is still the fourth quarter to navigate with its race for a COVID-19 vaccine, the race for the White House, and the race to avoid a no-deal Brexit that would end a 3-1/2 year long Britain-Brussels standoff with an explosive bang. 
Ashmore's Jan Dehn is bracing for another wild few months.
""Data are not getting any stronger and are beginning to roll over and you have all the political noise ahead of the U.S. elections which is starting to get a little frayed.
""On top of that we have markets which are very expensive because they have rallied like mad since March,"" he said.

The ruling on September 15 said that tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump's administration on more than $200 billion in Chinese goods broke trade rules because they were above maximum rates and applied only to China.
""We think that the panel made an objective and fair decision,"" Zhang Xiangchen said at a virtual trade conference in which his U.S. counterpart Dennis Shea also participated. 
""We hope that it will facilitate the prompt resolution of the dispute between China and the U.S.,"" he added. Shea did not comment on the case at the event although the U.S. Trade Representative previously criticised the ruling.
If Washington chooses to appeal the ruling, the dispute will go into a legal void, as the top WTO appeals body is paralysed because the United States has blocked the appointment of judges.

In the ruling, the panel recommended that Washington bring its measures into conformity with trade rules, while urging both sides to work to resolve the overall trade dispute.

70,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 10:27AM ET</span>",Lagarde Says ECB Will Act If Needed as Pandemic Burdens Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank is ready to deploy more monetary stimulus to aid the recovery if needed as the pandemic damps prospects for the economy, according to President Christine Lagarde.
Addressing European lawmakers on Monday, Lagarde called the recovery across the 19-nation euro zone uncertain and incomplete, with consumers cautious to spend and companies reluctant to invest.
“The public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity and poses downside risks to the economic outlook,” Lagarde said in a video conference with members of the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. The Governing Council “continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate.”
Resurgent coronavirus infections are threatening new restrictions, jeopardizing the economic progress made since lockdowns earlier this year plunged the region into a deep recession.
Policy makers have started to stake out their positions ahead of a discussion on whether the ECB should add support to nurture the economy. Most economists predict the 1.35 trillion euro ($1.6 trillion) emergency bond-buying program will be expanded this year -- probably in December when new economic forecasts are published.
The ECB said earlier this month that the recovery is in line with its baseline projections. Yet some of the most recent surveys have shown that while manufacturing is still improving, services are shrinking again.
One of the most worrying consequences for ECB officials -- including recently Executive Board member Fabio Panetta and Bank of Spain Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos -- is flagging inflation. The annual rate of consumer prices fell below zero in August for the first time in four years.
Lagarde said headline inflation in the euro area is expected to remain negative over the coming months -- in part due to a stronger euro. Preliminary inflation data for September are due on Friday.
“The Governing Council will carefully assess all incoming information, including developments in the exchange rate, with regard to its implications for the medium-term inflation outlook,” Lagarde said.

71,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 10:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: EU chair Germany proposes adherence to rule of law as key to getting bloc's cash,"By Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Germany, current president of the European Union, has proposed a scheme that links access to EU money, including the 750 billion euro recovery fund, to respecting the rule of law, a document seen by Reuters showed on Monday. 
The proposal will underpin negotiations between the European Parliament and the 27 EU governments, which in July agreed to such a mechanism in principle but left out much detail to avoid a veto from Poland or Hungary, whose nationalist governments stand accused of flouting EU democratic norms.
Warsaw and Budapest are under EU investigation for undermining the independence of the judiciary, media and non-governmental organisations, and both could lose tens of billions of euros in funding if the rule of law mechanism is established.
In the recovery fund alone, excluding the linked long-term EU budget for 2021-27, Poland would be at risk of losing access to 23 billion euros ($26.84 billion) and Hungary to six billion.
""The rule of law requires that all public powers act within the constraints set out by law ... under the control of independent and impartial courts,"" reads the proposed draft regulation, which needs the approval of the European Parliament.
But the vast majority of EU lawmakers want the link between money and the rule of law to be stronger than agreed in July and the German proposal - sticking closely to the leaders' summer agreement - is all but certain to disappoint the chamber. 
Liberal German EU lawmaker Moritz Korner, who leads the chamber's work on the matter, said Berlin was ""cuddling"" with eurosceptic, nationalist rulers in Warsaw and Budapest. 
""Without an automatic sanction system, Germany's proposal fails to defend the rule of law and the correctness of the EU budget spendings,"" he told Reuters when asked about the scheme. 
According to the German document, punishment for rule of law breaches would include suspending the flow of EU money to capitals seen as breaching democratic checks and balances. It would be decided by a majority vote of EU governments on a recommendation by the EU's executive European Commission. 
This could allow other governments to override opposition from Poland and Hungary. 
But those seeking a stronger link argue that a majority of EU governments should be needed to decline, rather than endorse any recommendation by the Commission, to suspend funding for those flouting the rule of law. 
That formula would make penalties more likely by leaving governments less room for political horse-trading.
""FINGER-WAGGING""
Some have cautioned, however, that seeking too ambitious a solution could backfire, given that Warsaw or Budapest might withdraw their support if the proposal is changed from what they signed up to in July after four days of tortuous talks.
""It is important that all sides stick to the delicate compromise reached. What didn't find the support of the (leaders) at that time, will certainly not find it now,"" said one official working on the matter.
Germany has already called on EU lawmakers to speed up work on approving the bloc's next budget, the recovery fund and the related rule of law conditions so that money can start flowing, including to the ailing south of the EU, from 2021. 
Asked about the Reuters story on Monday, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Poland would stick to the July agreement.
""There is no consent in Poland to allow for arbitrary application of various clauses and finger-wagging only because someone doesn't like our government,"" he told reporters. 
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban threatened to veto a related decision if the July agreement on the rule of law mechanism is not honoured, which would derail the next EU budget and the recovery fun, together worth some 1.8 trillion euros.

75,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 08:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Lagarde's peace at risk as ECB splits over virus response - sources,"By Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymakers are increasingly divided over how to steer the economy through a second wave of COVID-19, threatening President Christine Lagarde's hard-won peace, conversations with eight ECB insiders show. 
Lagarde has managed to end the public infighting that left the ECB in disarray in the final months of Mario Draghi's tenure last year and she has seamlessly pushed through several record stimulus packages to keep the economy afloat amid the pandemic.
Her pledge to seek consensus and bring sceptics onboard is in stark contrast to her predecessor Draghi, who rarely engaged key opponents of his policies and signalled moves even before any discussion within the Governing Council. 
But tensions are rising again as a fresh surge in infections forces the ECB to contemplate even more stimulus, with old rifts resurfacing and chief economist Philip Lane coming under fire from all sides.
Conservative policymakers, known in central bank jargon as ""hawks"", argue that the ECB is downplaying some of the good news, such as a stream of better-than-expected economic indicators over the summer.
In the opposite corner, ""dovish"" central bankers are pushing Lagarde to adapt stronger language both on the risks to growth and the threat from the euro's appreciation against the dollar. 
Disagreements were already clear during the last policy meeting in September, the eight sources, all with direct knowledge of the process, told Reuters.
The hawks wanted the ECB to quietly reduce its bond purchases given the relatively benign market conditions, saving its firepower so it can raise the pace of buying again if needed at a later date without increasing the overall size of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP).
Some also argued that economic projections were too pessimistic because they failed to account for fiscal stimulus measures already announced which would inevitably lead to higher growth and inflation. 
Both of these points were rejected by chief economist Lane, but so was a call to give a clearer warning about the risks to growth from a stronger euro, the sources said. 
The ECB, which speaks on behalf of board members, declined to comment. 
DOVISH REBELLION?
While most policymakers have echoed Lagarde's ""wait and see"" stance in public statements, some took a decisively dovish tone in the meeting, openly discussing prospects for more stimulus, something Lagarde has deliberately steered clear of.
Some of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, especially objected to ECB board member Fabio Panetta's comments last week that the ECB should err on the side of doing too much rather than too little. 
Panetta, who joined the board at the start of the year, argued that inflation was uncomfortably below the ECB's target and in such situations a policy response may be necessary.
""It's like Mario is back,"" one of the sources said, referring to Draghi's tendency to deviate from the Governing Council's message and front-run policy before others had a chance to weigh in.
But the sources added that Lagarde is for now keeping her end of the bargain and she is even engaging with policymakers Draghi did not talk to.
""She's working the phones non-stop and managed to get a consensus in June so I have no reason to think she's about to change her style,"" another source said. 
Some senior ECB staff have advocated increasing the quota for emergency bond buying to 2 trillion euros from the current 1.35 trillion euros but Lagarde pushed back on that suggestion, bolstering her credibility among policymakers who were often at odds with Draghi, one of the sources said. 
The sources said that while policy action may be necessary in December, bringing disagreements into the public domain and fuelling market expectations with dovish comments could make it more difficult to keep it consensual.
""If you front-run policy in public debate, then you harden positions and make it difficult to compromise,"" one of the sources said. ""That's when you get public dissent and market confusion.""
The sources also agreed that while the possibility of a rate cut was still there, as often stated by the bank, there was no appetite for such a move and it was not being discussed. 
LANE ON THE SPOT
While the majority of policymakers were happy with Lagarde's management style, Lane, who is seen as the most influential voice on policy matters, was criticised by both factions.
On the one hand, he was criticised for a choice of words deemed too timid on the euro's appreciation at the Sept. 10 policy meeting, underwhelming traders.
Some policymakers had insisted during the policy meeting on tougher language, like that used by Draghi in 2018, but Lane pushed back, two sources said.
On the other hand, hawks objected to Lane's blog post the day after the meeting, in which he took a dimmer view on inflation and warned against complacency, suggesting he wanted to amend the agreed policy message, several sources said.
Other signs of the tension, the sources said, were the growing number of leaks from the Governing Council, some of which lack credibility and are designed to steer the debate, rather than reveal it.
One leak suggested the ECB was contemplating extending emergency powers to its open-ended bond purchase scheme, a notion Yves Mersch, who also heads the ECB's legal services, rejected.

""No such thing was ever discussed,"" a second source said. ""Removing limits indefinitely would be a guaranteed way to get us sent back to court.""

76,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>",Germany to issue 6 billion euros more debt than planned in fourth quarter due to coronavirus,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany plans to issue 6 billion euros ($7 billion) more debt in the fourth quarter than it originally planned, the German finance agency said on Monday, to fund spending to tackle the coronavirus pandemic that has battered the economy.
Europe's largest economy will issue a total of 50.5 billion euros in debt in the October-December period excluding inflation-linked debt, the agency said. 
That includes beefing up its issuance of money market instruments to 21.5 billion euros from its original plans to auction off 15.5 billion euros of the short-term debt.
The debt agency said it would issue two inflation-linked bonds in the fourth quarter, without giving details on their issuance volume, but it said the total funds generated from such debt in 2020 would reach around 6 billion euros.
The agency also said it would issue its second green bond in November with a five-year maturity and an issuance volume of 5 billion euros as part of its efforts to establish a yield curve for the booming sustainable finance market, confirming what sources had previously told Reuters. 
Germany has seen good demand for its first-ever green bond, issued earlier in September, which was seen as a landmark moment for Europe's climate-focused finance drive.

77,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 07:06AM ET</span>",French 2021 budget to release first 42 billion euros of recovery plan,"By Leigh Thomas
PARIS (Reuters) - The French government on Monday presented a 2021 budget plotting a path out of its worst post-war recession, with 42 billion euros pumped into the economy in the first year of its 100 billion euro two-year recovery plan.
The government expects the euro zone's second-biggest economy to contract a record 10% this year following a nearly two-month coronavirus lockdown, plunging the country into one of the deepest recessions in Europe.
Paris has mobilised more than 470 billion euros in tax breaks, state-subsidised furloughs and business loan guarantees to contain the crisis, blowing the public sector budget deficit out to a record 10.2% of GDP this year.
The economy bounced back after the lockdown was lifted in May and the government forecasts it will surge 8% next year, boosted by the first tranche of the 100 billion euro recovery plan.
""We are going to make sure that the 42 billion euros are spent rapidly,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told journalists in a presentation of the 2021 budget.
The Public Finance High Council, an independent oversight panel, said the growth forecasts were cautious for this year but ambitious for 2021 and said the deficit targets were reachable.
The COVID-19 outbreak blew a more than 100 billion euro hole in the central state's deficit, which swelled to 195 billion euros this year and has to financed by additional debt.
As a result, the public debt is set to surge from less than 100% of gross domestic product last year to 117.5% this year before easing to 116.2%
Le Maire said that the extra debt would be paid down through the return of economic growth, careful budget management and structural reforms such as a planned pension overhaul, which the coronavirus epidemic put on hold.
He added that if France was able to make the billions of euros in investments foreseen by its recovery plan, it was thanks to low borrowing costs created by the European Central Bank's monetary stimulus.

""The European Central Bank is protecting and allowing us to carry out our recovery programme,"" Le Maire said.

78,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 07:02AM ET</span>","Stocks Jump, Trump's Tax and Uber Licenses: What's up in Markets on Monday","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Donald Trump's tax returns are leaked by the NYT; the TikTok ban is struck down by a Washington district court. Stocks are set to jump in what looks more like a correction than anything else; Uber (NYSE:UBER) gets its London license back and the pound jumps as the last round of Brexit talks starts. What's moving markets on Monday, September 28th.
1. Trump's tax returns lack punch
The New York Times released an in-depth expose of President Donald Trump’s tax returns, which showed that he paid only $750 in income tax in the year he was elected.
The disclosures failed to disclose much in broad terms about Trump’s businesses that was not already known, but confirmed the general picture that he had used all of his TV income and more to cross-subsidize vanity projects such as his various golf courses.
It seems unlikely that that will do much to erode support among the President’s core voter base, even if it provides Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden with a useful line of attack in Tuesday’s first debate of the presidential election campaign.
2. TikTok ban struck down; Coney Barrett nominated to succeed RBG
Trump had a busy weekend in other respects too, nominating Amy Coney Barrett to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by liberal champion Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Coney Barrett, a federal judge and a staunch Roman Catholic who once served as clerk to the late Antonin Scalia, would widen the conservative majority in the Supreme Court to 6-3, if confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate – as seems likely.
Elsewhere, a district court in Washington DC struck down Trump’s attempt to ban downloads of the Chinese lip-synching app TikTok. The Commerce Department still plans to render the app unusable in the U.S. from November 12, unless the U.S., China and the company’s owners can hammer out a compromise that satisfies all sides. The U.S. also unveiled fresh measures to restrict sales of sensitive equipment to Chinese chipmaker SMIC.
3. Stocks bounce hard in correction 
U.S. stock markets are set to open sharply higher, helped partly by the lack of a killer punch in the NY Times’ tax disclosures but driven largely by what appeared to be bargain-hunting after four weeks of losses in the major indexes.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow 30 futures contract was up 358 points, or 1.3%, while S&P 500 Futures were up 1.7%.
There was little in the way of fundamental news to change the picture that has driven the last month’s losses. The Covid-19 virus continues to spread rapidly through  the northern hemisphere with the onset of autumn, with France, the U.K. and other European countries all tightening local restrictions on gatherings.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Uber, which regained its license to operate in London, one of its biggest markets outside the U.S., after a successful legal appeal. Also in the spotlight will be Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Entertainment, whose $3.7 billion offer for U.K. bookmaker William Hill  (OTC:WIMHY) was lower than speculated on Friday.
4. First European exchange hits post-pandemic all-time high 
William Hill was one of few losers in European markets in early trading, with most rebounding sharply after last week’s losses.
The modest Copenhagen market became the first European index to post an all-time high since the pandemic started, rising 1.1% to 1,349.46 points. Copenhagen’s OMX Copenhagen 20 index is notable for its concentration of renewable energy stocks, including wind farm operator Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) and wind turbine maker  Vestas Wind Systems AS  (OTC:VWDRY), which have ridden a wave of buying from ESG-themed investors this year.
The OMXC 20 also includes healthcare and biotech names such as Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), Novozymes (OTC:NVZMY) and  Coloplast A  (OTC:CLPBY), all of which have fared well against the backdrop of the pandemic.
At 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), ECB President Christine Lagarde will address the European parliament, while board member Isabel Schnabel is due to speak at a separate event.
5. Pound leaps on rate comments, Brexit talks
The pound rose to a three-week high against the euro and a 10-day high against the dollar on renewed hopes of a deal to regulate the U.K.’s trading arrangements with the EU after its Brexit transition period expires at the end of the year.
Sterling had slid more than 3% since the start of the month on fears that the U.K. government was willing to accept a disorderly scenario of customs backlogs and a new hard border on the island of Ireland, a result of preferring sovereignty over local standards to frictionless trade with its biggest trade partner.
The pound was supported by comments from Bank of England Monetary Policy Council member Dave Ramsden playing down the prospect of negative rates in the near future."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's leaders are poised to endorse a lower economic growth target for Beijing's next five-year plan compared with 2016-2020, as authorities navigate growing challenges fuelled by a deepening rift with the United States, policy sources said.
President Xi Jinping and other leaders are expected to discuss and approve China's economic and social development blueprint for 2021-2025 at a key Communist Party conclave in October, the sources told Reuters.
State news agency Xinhua said on Monday the meeting will be held from Oct. 26-29.   
Policymakers believe that setting a five-year growth target is vital for steering the world's second-largest economy past the 'middle income trap', the sources said, after internal debate over whether it should abandon such targets to enable more flexibility.
The target also keeps local governments focused on development goals at a time of a deepening rift between China and the United States over a broad range of issues, they said. 
""There will be an economic target. Where is the direction of development if there is no such anchor?"" said one source who is involved in the debate.
Government think tanks and economists have made recommendations for average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth targets including ""around 5%"", 5-5.5% to 5-6%, the sources said. 
China is targeting average annual growth of over 6.5% for the 13th five-year plan that ends this year. 
China's State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Some government advisers have argued that China should do away with official growth targets - a legacy of decades of central economic planning - to reduce reliance on debt-fueled stimulus and encourage more productive investment. 
Reform advocates hope President Xi's proposed ""dual circulation"" strategy, expected to be the centrepiece at the conclave, is an opportunity to quicken reforms to spur domestic demand and unleash fresh growth engines.
In May, China abandoned its annual GDP growth target, for 2020, for the first time in 18 years due to a heavy blow from the coronavirus crisis, although some economists suspected the government has maintained an implicit goal of around 3%.
The five-year plan is expected to be unveiled at the annual parliament meeting in early 2021. A growth target for 2021 itself, also to be unveiled at the parliament session, is likely to be set by top leaders at an annual economic conference in December.
""We expect the government to either not set an explicit growth target or set a lower and more flexible (e.g., around 5%) growth target"" for 2021-2025, analysts at UBS said in a note to clients.
'CRITICAL PERIOD'
China faces growing headwinds to maintain its ascent as the United States ratchets up pressure on trade, technology and other fronts, threatening a decoupling of the world's two largest economies.
Annual growth of about 5% would be enough for China to bypass the ""middle income trap"" that has befallen countries such as Argentina, Brazil and South Africa, which have struggled to boost productivity and shift towards higher value-added industries.
The World Bank defines high-income countries as those with per capita gross national income (GNI) of above $12,535. China's per capita income reached $10,410 in 2019, according to the World Bank.
The State Council's Development Research Centre, the cabinet's think tank, said in a recent report that it expects China to become a high income nation by 2024 and overtake the United States as the world's largest economy by 2032. 
""The 14th five-year plan period will be a critical period for China to deal with frictions with the United States and make strategic arrangements,"" the think tank said in the report. 

Analysts expect China's GDP to grow 2-3% in 2020, the weakest since 1976, but growth could rebound to over 7% in 2021 thanks to a lower base, but the longer term trend is for slower growth as the population ages and the economy matures.

""For me, I see the effective lower bound still at 0.1 which is where Bank Rate is at present,"" Ramsden said in an interview with Britain's Society of Professional Economists posted online.
The BoE, seeking ways to help Britain's economy through the coronavirus crisis, said this month it would look at how it might be able to implement negative rates if they were needed.
That comment built on an announcement in August that the option of a sub-zero Bank Rate was part of the BoE's toolbox.
One of the BoE's nine interest-rate setters, Silvana Tenreyro, said in a newspaper interview published on Saturday that the investigation into whether negative rates might help the economy had found ""encouraging"" evidence.
Ramsden said in his interview with the SPE that there were some jurisdictions where negative rates appeared to have been more positive than their use in the euro zone and Japan.
He said the BoE was not going to use negative rates imminently and engagement with banks on the possible change would take time.
Ramsden also sounded gloomier about the outlook for Britain's economy than the BoE's most recent forecasts.
""For me, when we're looking at unemployment, it is more likely that unemployment will end up peaking higher than 7.5% than lower, and it will end up coming down more gradually,” he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England and the European Union's securities watchdog said on Monday they have agreed on the information-sharing arrangements needed for the bloc's banks to continue using clearing houses in London from January to June 2022.
Britain's unfettered access to the bloc ends on Dec. 31, and Brussels had already decided it would grant temporary access for UK clearing houses for 18 months.
An updated cross-border regulatory accord between the BoE and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) was also needed to implement the decision.
ESMA said the temporary access will apply to three clearing houses in Britain: the London Stock Exchange's LCH, energy and agricultural futures and options clearer ICE (NYSE:ICE) Clear Europe, and LME Clear, which clears trades on the London Metal Exchange.
It has classified ICE Clearing and LCH as being ""systemically important"", meaning they will face close EU scrutiny on an on-going basis, particularly in any market crisis.
Brussels has said that banks operating in the EU should use the 18 months to cut their ""excessive reliance"" on clearers in London.
During this period, ESMA will conduct a comprehensive review of the systemic importance of each UK clearer and take any ""appropriate measures"" to address financial stability risks.
Measures could include deciding that a foreign clearer or some of its clearing services are of such substantial systemic importance that it should not be allowed to serve EU customers, ESMA said.
""ESMA undertakes to conduct such a comprehensive review in due time,"" it said.
LCH clears the bulk of euro-denominated interest rate swaps, a derivatives contract that helps companies shield themselves against unexpected moves in borrowing costs.
LCH said it would continue to engage and cooperate with authorities regarding ""long-term permanent"" access to the EU. 
But EU policymakers and the European Central Bank have long wanted euro clearing relocated to the euro zone, now seen by the bloc as all the more urgent due to Brexit.

Eurex Clearing in Frankfurt has been building up market share in euro swaps clearing but banks so far have been loathe to shift large positions there due to cost and complexity.

Many top company officials in France and Egypt were most likely to have recalibrated their lives after experiencing the pandemic blues, followed by those in the United Arab Emirates, the United States and Britain, according to a survey of about 2,000 high net-worth individuals by health insurer Bupa Global. 
The COVID-19 crisis has forced a vast majority of people, including top executives, to work remotely as governments imposed sweeping measures to curb the spread of the pandemic, putting a strain on physical and mental well-being.
Executives plan to exercise more regularly, eat a better diet, make time for meditation and spend more time with family and friends, the survey said.
""With the pandemic impacting mental health so heavily, it's really important that business leaders work to address any issues both personally and at their organisations,"" Bupa's medical director Luke James said
The survey also found that less than a third of the participants intend to keep working from home primarily, and a quarter of them planned to trim working hours.
Women were more likely than men to opt for working from home, it showed, although those with children were less likely to take that option.
""Anyone who has been working from home around young children or trying to juggle work and home-schooling will know it can be challenging,"" Bupa Managing Director Sheldon Kenton said.

As the line between work and personal space blurs, about a fifth of the high net-worth individuals surveyed said they would work remotely from their holiday homes as travel and face-to-face meetings decline.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's conservative government will need to embark on a more aggressive spending plan to power the country's virus-stricken economy and boost employment when it unveils its budget next week, Deloitte Access Economics said on Monday. 
Deloitte forecast a budget deficit of A$198.5 billion for the current financial year-ending June 2021, A$14 billion higher than the Treasury forecast in July, assuming no new fiscal policies are announced on Oct.6. 
That would be the highest since records began post-World War Two. Other economists, including AMP (OTC:AMLTF), expect 2020/21 budget deficit to surpass A$200 billion, from an estimated A$85.3 billion last year. 
""Australia's defence against the virus has been world class so far. But challenges are mounting,"" Deloitte Access Economics wrote in a note.
Families and businesses are set for a big cash crunch as emergency responses are tapered off by March 2021, money from early access to superannuation dries up, and as a range of mortgage and rent deferrals run out.
The government has already made a series of pre-budget announcements, including funding for domestic airlines and regional tourism. 
Further spending, including on big infrastructure projects, and tax cuts, are expected to be announced in the budget. 
Still, Australia's unemployment rate is seen rising to near 10% from close to 7% now and stay elevated for a number of years. 
Deloitte added the government will need to announce structural reforms as well as keep up its spending to aid a faster economic recovery. 
""That combination gives us the best chance to get back to the Australia of February as fast as we can,"" it added.
""And it underscores a key point: the need to let growth in the economy shrink the debt, rather than letting attempts to shrink the debt hold back the economy.""
Encouragingly, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg last week said the government would abandon its long-held aspiration to return the budget to surplus, saying clinging on to the past goal would no longer be prudent or appropriate.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will hold its monthly policy meeting on Oct.6, hours before the budget. Analysts see a 50-50 chance a rate cut to 0.1%.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is expected to pick up moderately to 51.2 in September from August's 51, according to the median forecast of 28 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity on a monthly basis. 
China's vast industrial sector is steadily returning to the levels seen before the pandemic paralysed huge swathes of the economy early this year. 
Pent-up demand, stimulus-driven infrastructure and surprisingly resilient exports have been the main drivers propelling the rebound. Consumption is also slowly recovering, despite signs of lagging spending among low-income groups.
Profits at China's industrial firms extended their robust growth for the fourth month in August, official data showed on Sunday.
Moreover, China's auto market rebounded smartly from the COVID-19 crash in recent months, executives said at a rare in-person trade show on Saturday.
However, the path ahead may not be smooth sailing, some analysts caution.
China's manufacturing PMI indices may start to level off in September on softening industrial metals prices and with a survey by Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) showing new orders and output weakening for smaller companies, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China Economist at Capital Economics, in a note.
""The initial boost to activity from lifting COVID-19 restrictions has run its course...Any further acceleration will therefore need to rely entirely on stronger demand,"" he said. 
The economy, which grew 3.2% in the second quarter year-on-year, is set to expand 2.2% this year - the weakest in over three decades.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector, will both be released on Sept. 30.

The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will also be published on Sept. 30. Analysts polled by Reuters expect a reading of 53.1, the same as in August. The Caixin services PMI survey will be out on Oct. 9.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian trade unions threatened on Monday to stage a national strike next month after a committee in parliament agreed to move ahead with proposed labour reforms in President Joko Widodo's controversial ""Job Creation"" bill.
Global investors are watching the bill closely to see that its terms have not been watered down in parliamentary debates, as Southeast Asia's largest economy tries to compete for manufacturing investment relocating from China.
Lawmakers in the legislation committee held meetings at the weekend to finish debating the bill so that it could be passed before parliament goes into recess on Oct. 9.
Trade unions were preparing to hold rallies this week and planned a national strike involving five million workers on Oct. 6-8, ahead of the vote, demanding proposed labour reforms be dropped, a union leader said.
""During the national strike, we will stop all production processes,"" Said Iqbal, president of the Confederation of Indonesia Trade Unions, said in a statement.
Unions and green groups have held several rallies to protest the bill, though rallies last week were relatively small.
On Sunday, the legislation committee agreed a cut in mandatory severance benefits paid by an employer to 23 times monthly wages, versus a current maximum of 32 times, said Firman Soebagyo, a lawmaker from the Golkar party. He said workers would still be eligible for the existing level and the government would fund the difference. 
The government had wanted maximum severance benefits to be cut to 19 times the monthly wage, arguing existing rules were too generous and deterred employers from hiring. 
The committee also rejected a proposal to tie the minimum wage only to economic growth and allow labour-intensive industries to set their own wage.
However, they endorsed proposals to cut mandatory paid leave, which includes menstrual leave, and allow longer work hours.
The proposed labour reforms are part of the so-called “omnibus” bill that clubs together changes in over 70 laws to allow parliament to vote in a single swoop to accelerate reforms.
The legislation committee must now invite at least one government minister to agree on its decision, before bringing their endorsement to a parliamentary vote.
Committee chairman Supratman Andi Atgas told Reuters such a meeting is yet to be scheduled as lawmakers work on the legal drafting of the final version of the bill.

89,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2020 08:20PM ET</span>",Negative real yields on sovereign debt here to stay: Reuters poll,"By Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Real yields on major sovereign bonds are deeply negative and expectations for positive returns anytime soon have disappeared as aggressive monetary easing and asset purchase programmes have much further to run, a Reuters poll showed.
For well over a decade, top central banks have adopted aggressive monetary policy tools in an attempt to suppress long-term borrowing costs to keep credit flowing to drive their economies back to higher growth and inflation.
Real, or inflation-adjusted, yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries plunged below zero this year amid the coronavirus pandemic, joining Japanese, German and British equivalent debt that has for much of the past decade given negative returns.
Although Reuters polls for many years have been wrong-footed in predicting bond yields would rise, the Sept. 17-24 poll of over 100 fixed-income strategists showed major government debt yields were still expected to increase around 20-30 basis points in a year.
But expectations for real returns over the coming year for those bonds adjusted against inflation were still negative, despite the massive and increasing government borrowing loads.
More than three-quarters of strategists, or 57 of 75 with a view, said the most likely path for sovereign yields would be to stay around current levels or be range-bound - not very far from this year's lows and well below their pre-COVID-19 rates.
That is largely a reflection of low-inflation expectations and major central banks' pledges to keep benchmark policy rates near zero, or below in some cases, and bond-buying programmes predicted to be extended beyond when the current plans expire.
""We continue to see bond yields being depressed and being held down by the policies of central banks to keep rates low, despite concerns of debt issuance that is simply being overshadowed by continued strong demand for bonds,"" said Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at Rabobank.
""You can always argue that demand for bigger government support leads to more debt issuance, therefore leading to higher interest rates, but that is not the pattern we've seen so far. That is because central banks play a major role here - whatever is being issued, is being taken out of the market, again, by those central banks' policies.""
The U.S. 10-year Treasury (US10YT=RR) yield was forecast to rise over 25 basis points to 0.93% in a year, about half the expected average inflation rate, suggesting negative real returns over the coming year. 
That 12-month ahead consensus was the lowest since polling began more than 20 years ago, reflecting the Federal Reserve's recent shift in policy to tolerate inflation running hot for an extended period and to hold fire on rates for years to come.
Nearly 80% of strategists, or 35 of 45 with a view, said the Fed's promise of near-zero interest rates for several years would keep major government bond yields ""low."" Only about 20% of respondents said it would ""not stop them from drifting higher.""
That lines up with expectations of currency analysts in a separate Reuters poll who said the biggest driver of the dollar's supremacy for well over two years - interest rate incentive - had fallen as reflected in lower yields on U.S. assets after the Fed's announcement. 
The dollar's fall has fuelled emerging market currencies and their sovereign debt this year, with expectations in the latest poll for that trend to hold over the next 12 months, despite a record increase in government borrowing in those countries.
But over 50% of 37 strategists with a view said emerging economies' government debt was most at risk of a sell-off over the coming year. Nearly 40% of respondents said corporate debt was at risk, but less than 10% said that of major developed economies' sovereign bonds.
With aggressive monetary easing by the European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and the Bank of England expected to extend well beyond this year, predictions in the latest poll were for real yields to be negative on German, Japanese and UK bonds.
The general notion that low interest rates would eventually spur price pressures has not materialised, underscoring the view that most major central banks that have not met their inflation target for several years would struggle to do so for many years to come. 
""We, as an economic society, need to be humble about our ability to understand inflation,"" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.

Sunak last week unveiled measures intended to support businesses and workers over the winter, part of a plan to revive the battered economy and at the same time contain the resurgent pandemic. But the package had little to offer nightclubs or the events industry which have yet to reopen following the national lockdown in March, or for theaters and the arts which are struggling to turn a profit on reduced audiences.
“The chancellor is consigning whole sectors of our economy to the scrap heap, damaging lives and livelihoods, and threatening the recovery,” Labour’s shadow business minister Lucy Powell said in a statement Sunday. “Many businesses have no idea when they can reopen. The decision to shut these firms out of the Job Support Scheme adds insult to injury.”
After spending 39 billion pounds ($50 billion) to date on a program that supported more than 9 million workers by paying up to 80% of their wages, Sunak is winding that down at the end of October. Britain, he said, needs to adapt to a “new normal” which will inevitably mean more job losses. “I cannot save every business, I cannot save every job,” he warned last week.
‘Viable’ Jobs
Central to Sunak’s plan is a “Jobs Support Scheme” that subsidizes employees who are able to return to their jobs on at least a third of their hours. The chancellor repeatedly told lawmakers in the House of Commons and journalists that the aim was to support jobs that remain “viable.”
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said last week the shift in support could tip an additional 2.2 million people into unemployment in the U.K. in coming months.
Labour on Sunday focused its analysis on industries that either aren’t allowed to reopen because of government restrictions, or can only do so in a reduced capacity. Jobs on the line include 69,000 people employed in nightclubs, 428,000 in pubs and bars, 369,000 in sports clubs, 142,000 events caterers, 11,000 exhibition organizers and 18,000 conference organizers, Labour said.
About 90,000 people working in the arts, as well as half a million people involved in the wedding industry as caterers, florists, photographers, dressmakers and beauticians, are also struggling, the party said.
Responding to Labour’s study, Conservative Party Co-Chairman Amanda Milling said Sunak’s program announced last week comes in addition to 190 billion pounds of expenditure to date on the pandemic response, which she described as “one of the most comprehensive packages of support in the world.”

Pinera said the government would pay private businesses up to 50%, or as much as $317 of the salaries of any newly hired employee for the next six months. A similar program will cover up to around $200 of the salaries of employees who return to work after a furlough period during the coronavirus crisis. 
The package, which seeks to create 1 million new jobs, is the latest round of stimulus aimed at revitalizing Chile's frail economy. 
Pinera's center-right government has in recent months announced emergency measures responding to the pandemic including spot payments, soft loans, mortgage payment holidays and rent subsidies worth more than 12% of gross domestic product.
The lockdown associated with the virus has hammered Chile's commerce, service and tourism sectors and driven unemployment to over 13%, its highest level in a decade. The central bank projects an economic contraction of between 4.5% to 5.5% this year. 
Pinera said his plan was aimed especially at groups hardest hit by jobless during the pandemic, including women, young people and those with disabilities. Businesses hiring people from those three groups could count on the government to subsidize as much as 60% of their salaries in the coming months, he said. 
Chile's coronavirus outbreak peaked in June. Since then, quarantine measures and other restrictions have seen cases nationwide fall to fewer than 2,000 daily. Chile has reported over 455,000 cases of the virus since the pandemic struck in March and 12,600 deaths.

""We are having our conversations. And when I have a conversation with the administration, it is in good faith,"" Pelosi said on CNN. ""I trust (Treasury) Secretary (Steve) Mnuchin to represent something that can reach a solution. And I believe we can come to an agreement.""
Formal talks between Pelosi, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows aimed at hammering out a relief package broke down on Aug. 7 with the two sides far apart. Pelosi and Mnuchin have since spoken by phone.
With formal COVID-19 relief talks stalled for weeks, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal on Thursday said Democratic lawmakers were starting to draft a bill totaling at least $2.2 trillion. 
Pelosi on Sunday said it was ""definitely a possibility"" that she would offer legislation in the coming days if the impasse with the Trump administration continued but said she would rather have a deal with the White House than a ""rhetorical argument.""
Any legislation the Democratic-led House might approve would be unlikely to advance in the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans.

Pelosi and Schumer had originally sought a $3.4 trillion relief package but have scaled back their demands. Meadows has previously said that Trump would be willing to sign a $1.3 trillion bill.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said there’s a chance she and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin can still reach a deal on a coronavirus stimulus package, and that Democrats will unveil a new “proffer” shortly.
“I trust Secretary Mnuchin to represent something that can reach a solution, and I believe we come to an agreement,” Pelosi said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
She added that if a deal isn’t struck soon, Democrats might vote on a House-only version of a coronavirus relief package, including funds for airlines and restaurants, and more Paycheck Protection Program funding.
“The public is going to have to see why $2.2 (trillion), or now $2.4 (trillion), perhaps, is necessary,” she said, adding that President Donald Trump’s “denial of the virus, and resistance to do anything to crush it, has made matters worse.”
Discussion of a potential fresh House vote on stimulus follows weeks of resistance by Pelosi to suggestions from moderate members that Democrats need to show Americans they’ve taken some additional action since passing their Heroes Act in May.
Democrats and the White House will have to pick up the pace to complete a package before the Nov. 3 election after hitting an impasse in early August with the sides far apart.
Recently, Pelosi has insisted that the White House agree to at least $2.2 trillion in new aid, including funds for cash-strapped state and local governments and $600 per week in supplemental unemployment benefits.
Trump has indicated he could support as much as $1.5 trillion in aid, higher than the $650 billion put forth in a “skinny” aid package by Senate Republicans.
Pelosi pushed back on CNN when asked if Democrats might offer to reduce their figure even more. However, she also said the preference is to have an actual deal than simply pass another bill in the House that’s dead on arrival in the Senate.
“I’d rather have a deal that puts money in people’s pockets than to have a rhetorical argument,” said Pelosi. “What we will be putting forth is a proffer to say, now let us negotiate within a time frame and a dollar amount to get the job done.”

July’s economic and fiscal update, which saw an extra A$15.6 billion spent on easier eligibility for the JobKeeper wage subsidy and another A$2 billion to extend telehealth, was released before Melbourne’s Stage 4 lockdowns.
“Yet it’s not all bad news,” said Chris Richardson, a Deloitte partner. “Treasury assumed iron ore prices would immediately nosedive, almost halving to $55 a ton ahead of Christmas. But they’ve actually gone up, trading at double those rates. And Treasury was very conservative in its other forecasts.”
Australia has been buffeted by lockdowns and state-border controls driven by the coronavirus pandemic, with the economy contracting by the most on record last quarter and sliding into its first recession in almost 30 years. An initial recovery, driven by early lifting of restrictions and reopening of the economy, was interrupted by a resurgence of the virus and renewed lockdown in Melbourne, the nation’s second-largest city.
Victoria is now gradually starting to unwind its measures.
The Oct. 6 budget is likely to “gradually change gear” from protecting old jobs toward creating new jobs, Deloitte said. It expects plenty of infrastructure stimulus that will inject cash into the economy and generate jobs, including the construction of social housing.
“Various leaks suggest that there’ll be elements of that agenda announced on budget night,” Richardson said. “And we especially like the possibility that wage subsidies will start to swing away from protecting old jobs toward creating new jobs.”

Visco also denied ECB policymakers were divided on the matter and said his views echoed those of the Executive Board.
""The euro's recent strengthening is worrying us because it generates further downward pressures on prices at a time when inflation is already low,"" Visco, Italy's central bank governor, told an event in Trento.
""The monetary policy implications are obvious: if the downward pressures jeopardise our price stability objective, we'll have to intervene.
""If, however, opposite effects were to emerge, the measures we've already taken could suffice.""

The euro hit its highest level since mid-2018 on Sept. 1 at $1.2011, but has since given up half of its gains for the year, closing at $1.1630 on Friday amid a new surge in coronavirus cases in Europe.

Tenreyro told the Sunday Telegraph that she did not expect Britain to continue to enjoy a fast V-shaped recovery, due to headwinds from local flare-ups in COVID-19, rising unemployment and a ""very weak"" global economic outlook.
Britain's central bank said in August that it was taking a closer look at the case for cutting interest rates below zero, and in September it said it would take a detailed look at the idea's technical feasibility during the fourth quarter.
However Governor Andrew Bailey said this did not mean the BoE was committed to going ahead with the idea, which would potentially see people charged for holding deposits with banks.
Tenreyro said evidence from the euro zone and Japan showed that cutting interest rates below zero had succeeded in reducing companies' borrowing costs and did not make it unprofitable for banks to lend.
""The evidence has been encouraging,"" she said, adding that cuts in interest rates below zero had been almost fully reflected in reductions in interest rates charged to borrowers.
""Banks adapted well – their profitability increased with negative rates largely because impairments and loss provisions have decreased with the boost to activity and the increase in asset prices,"" she said.
So far, the BoE has responded to the coronavirus pandemic by cutting interest rates to a record-low of 0.1% and expanding its asset purchase programme by 300 billion pounds ($382 billion).
Tenreyro said she expected Britain's rebound from the historic 20% slump in output during the lockdown in the second quarter looked set to lose pace as COVID-19 cases rose again.
""Flare-ups like we're seeing may potentially lead to more localised lockdowns and will keep interrupting that V(-shaped recovery).""
She added that it was too early to judge if scaled-back job support plans announced by finance minister Rishi Sunak on Thursday would have a big impact in staving off a rise in unemployment, especially in hard-hit sectors such as high-street retail and hospitality.
""Another factor interrupting the V is a very weak global outlook, with high uncertainties, particularly with a second wave already striking many countries,"" she said.

Last December, West Africa's eight-nation monetary union announced it would sever some financial links with Paris and switch to the new currency, called the eco, by the end of 2020 while keeping it pegged to the euro.
But these ambitions have been thwarted as countries instead grapple with the economic fallout from the global pandemic. The International Monetary Fund expects Sub-Saharan Africa’s economy to contract 3.2% this year - its worst performance on record.
""We know the eco cannot be put in place this year because of COVID-19,"" Ouattara told journalists during a visit to the city of Bouafle.
He said talks on the eco were held in Niger on Sept 7., where countries vowed to work on achieving the agreed criteria for the currency's launch, including national budget deficits at or below 3% of gross domestic product.
""We think it will be difficult to get to a 3% deficit for two or three years, so personally I don't see the eco's arrival for three to five years,"" he said.
He was speaking in a personal capacity and not on behalf of the currency union, which has not yet commented on a new timeframe for the currency's launch. 
Ivory Coast is the largest economy in the bloc, which includes Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo - all former French colonies except Guinea-Bissau.
Ghana has said it would also want to adopt the eco, but has urged members of the currency union to ditch the planned euro peg.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Thais on Saturday flocked to a government-organised job expo with more than a million jobs up for grabs as it works to stem mounting unemployment in an economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy could shrink by a record 8.5% this year, with its key tourism sector taking a beating, the government predicts, leaving young and old alike searching for work.
More than 570 booths, from public organisations, private firms and for roles overseas, were set up for job seekers at a ""JOB EXPO THAILAND 2020"" in Bangkok, which runs until Monday.
""I got laid off,"" said 23-year-old Chanissara Prommas. ""I used to work for Hong Kong Airlines, but the company couldn't deal with the cost, so they had to let go some of the staff"".
Teera Magaumpai, 50, who lost his job after 30 years in the tourist sector, said the big crowd reflected huge unemployment and ""elders have to fight with first jobbers"".
Some of Thailand's biggest firms were among those offering jobs, including agribusiness  Charoen  Pokphand Foods (BK:CPF), Telecoms firm True Corp (BK:TRUE) and energy group PTT (BK:PTT), which is majority owned by the government.
Although Thailand, which has suffered just 3,522 coronavirus infections, has lifted most restrictions and daily life and work is mostly back to normal, a ban on foreign tourists remains in place, cutting a swathe through a whole sector of career opportunities. 
About 1.24 million jobs will be offered - with most in the private sector, and a little over 100,000 in roles overseas. Of that total, the government will help companies pay half in hiring 260,000 new graduates for a year.
""People are the most important part of the country and for moving it forward,"" Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said as he opened the event.
The job offer is part of relief measures as the government has introduced a 1.9 trillion baht ($60 billion) package to mitigate the impact of the outbreak.
Supant Mongkolsuthree, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries, estimated job losses at a record 2.5-3.0 million this year, with more than a million in the tourist sector. Thailand has a workforce of about 38 million.
The government predicts just 6.7 million foreign visitors this year after last year's record 39.8 million visitors, whose spending made up about 11.4% of GDP.

LONDON (Reuters) - The number of British entrepreneurs looking to ""buy"" citizenship from countries offering visa-free access to the European Union has risen sharply, investment migration firms say, as prospects of a post-Brexit trade deal between Britain and the bloc darken.
Investment immigration firm Astons said it had seen a 50% and 30% year-on-year increase in interest from clients seeking Cypriot or Greek citizenship respectively this quarter, less than four months before UK passport-holders are likely to lose their rights to freedom of movement across the EU.
Henley & Partners also reported a rise in requests for advice on investment migration applications to Malta, Portugal, Austria and several Caribbean islands, which offer a range of residency rights, visa-free travel to the EU and citizenship to investors in local business or property.
Citizens of certain Caribbean sovereign states including St Lucia and St Kitts & Nevis also enjoy preferred access to the EU, thanks to close ties with EU members as a result of historic, diplomatic and modern trade agreements. 
""This isn't about tourists. This is the UK high net worth community that have a constant need to travel to and spend significant time in the EU,"" said Henley & Partners director Paddy Blewer. 
""This is investment migration as a volatility hedge and a component in a high net worth portfolio value defence strategy,"" he said, adding that volumes of client engagement were higher now than immediately after the 2016 Brexit vote.
Interest in additional citizenships is rising even as the European Commission examines possible steps to curb EU states selling passports and visas to wealthy foreigners, due to concerns it can help organised crime groups.
Cypriot residency can be secured in two months with a 300,000 euro ($351,870) property purchase. Securing citizenship takes six months and requires a minimum property investment of 2 million euros.
In December, Reuters reported that Cyprus government documents showed several donors to Britain's ruling Conservative Party donors had sought citizenship of the island since the 2016 Brexit referendum. 
""Both Cypriot and Caribbean investments are proving very popular ... primarily driven by high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) from the UK who have an eye on the future and life after Brexit,"" said Astons spokesman Konstantin Kaminskiy.
CARIBBEAN DREAM
Henley & Partners said its volume of engagement with clients seeking alternative citizenship or residence by investment climbed 40% in the first quarter of 2020 versus Q1 2019, before flattening during the COVID-19 lockdown in Q2.
But interest has rallied since July 1, with a 15% year-on-year increase in engagement to Sept. 10, as the end of the Brexit transition phase nears.
Henley & Partners' Blewer said clients were increasingly drawn to Caribbean citizenship applications - which is likely to give them better travel access to the EU than Britain - but which have a lower minimum investment and a quicker approval process.
Saint Lucia citizenship, offering visa-free travel to 146 countries, can be obtained in around four months for a minimum investment of 76,152 pounds, data supplied by Astons showed.
For less than 40,000 pounds more, investors can obtain citizenship of St. Kitts & Nevis - and visa-free travel to 156 countries - in around 60 days.
In contrast, Malta offers citizenship in exchange for around 1 million pounds of investment, but the process takes up to 14 months. 
Portugal, meanwhile, typically processes investment migration applications in three months but only grants EU residency to investors and visa-fee travel to just 26 countries.
  ""With HNWIs, time is often more important than what is essentially a small fluctuation in cost and many are looking to secure additional citizenship as fast as possible in the pandemic landscape,"" Arthur Sarkisian, managing director of Astons, said.
EU authorities are under pressure to clamp down on investment migration programmes by member states.
Sven Giegold, a member of the European Parliament from Germany's Green party, said these kind of citizenship sales ""posed a serious threat to EU security and the fight against corruption"" in the bloc.
""EU passports and visas are not a commodity. Money must not be the criterion for citizenship and residence rights in the EU,"" he said.

China will conform to international rules to promote further integration of its capital markets, and continue interest rate and exchange rate reforms in a steady and prudent manner, Lu Lei, deputy director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), said during an industry forum in Shanghai.
""China should use a higher level of opening to counter the risks of blockade and containment，and actively embrace，and integrate into the global financial system,"" Lu said.
Beijing is accelerating financial market deregulation as intensifying Sino-U.S tensions raise concerns about the risks that China decouples economically and technologically with the rest of the world.
To boost cross-border private equity investment，China is looking to revise rules for its private equity and overseas investment schemes, Lu said on Friday. 
The Qualified Foreign Limited Partner, or QFLP, allows qualified foreign institutions to make private equity investments in China while the Qualified Domestic Limited Partnership, or QDLP, allows foreign fund managers with awarded quotas to raise money in China for overseas investments. 
Lu also vowed to increase exchange rate flexibility to cushion against volatility in the economy and balance of international payments.

China on Friday moved to further ease foreign access to its capital markets, officially combining two major inbound investment schemes and broadening the scope for foreign institutional investment.

(Reuters) - With COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. topping 200,000 this week following a rise in new daily cases last week for the first time in eight weeks, the role of the economy in the looming presidential election could take on heightened importance -- but it is not clear how. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said repeatedly, including several times this week alone, that the strength of the country's economic recovery depends on keeping the novel coronavirus under control -- critical to instilling confidence in Americans that it is safe to resume normal activity.
Among the six battleground states, ones that are hotly contested because their population can swing either to Republicans or Democrats, Wisconsin looks particularly troubled less than six weeks before the Nov. 3 election determines whether Republican President Donald Trump is re-elected or is ousted by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Wisconsin stands out for its high and rising load of new coronavirus cases, about two-and-a-half times the U.S. average, adjusting for population. 
With more than 1,900 new cases on average each day, Wisconsin's governor this week declared a state of emergency.
The seven-day average of new cases is also rising sharply in Arizona, another battleground state, but the rate on a per capita basis is below the national average. 
The virus in battleground states: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ECONOMY/yzdvxqaklpx/chart.png
An incumbent president's reelection usually is closely tied to the health of the economy. But the links between the virus, the economy and how people will vote in the presidential election remain far from clear. 
Among the six battleground states, Biden appears to be ahead in just two, Reuters/Ipsos polls show: Michigan, where the virus has mostly stayed under control, and Wisconsin, where it has not. 
Like the link between the virus and vote, the link between the virus and the economy is less than obvious. 
The unemployment rate in Pennsylvania, at 10.3% in August, was higher than in any other of the battleground states, even as the case load there is low and falling. Arizona's unemployment rate, at 5.9%, was the lowest. 
Out of work in battleground states: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ECONOMY/yxmpjbjqwpr/chart.png
Nationally, COVID-19 cases surged in the summer, just when household spending staged a comeback from the worst quarter in U.S. economic history since at least 1947. 
But, as JP Morgan chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli noted this week, households were getting a big fiscal boost at the time. In July they received $75 billion in extra unemployment benefits. Those benefits expired at the end of July, leaving out-of-work households with far less cash to spend. 
July was also the month when the Paycheck Protection Program delivered its peak support to small businesses.
Government aid is mostly tapped out and the U.S. recovery is showing signs of slowing, though bright spots remain, with economic data this week confirming a hot housing sector and a burst of new business orders for equipment.
However, some 26 million Americans continue to rely on unemployment benefits, foot traffic to U.S. restaurants and retail stores is showing little recent improvement, and small businesses are increasingly stressed, data showed this week. One survey showed 40% of small businesses expect they will not earn enough revenue through the end of the year to stay in business. 

Analysts at banks including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) this week trimmed their forecasts for growth next quarter.

In a bid to lower drug prices, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on Friday finalized a plan that includes a measure allowing states to purchase medicines from Canada.
It is a move that Trudeau and Canadian distributors have opposed in the past. 
""Our priority will always be to ensure an adequate and safe supply for Canadians first and foremost,"" Trudeau said at a news conference, when asked about the U.S. plan.
But he added that ""any moves by the United States will be taken into account"" as the country builds up its pharmaceutical capacity during the coronavirus pandemic, and added that Canada would ""be there to help other countries in need as well.""
Reuters reported last year https://fr.reuters.com/article/us-canada-pharmaceuticals-exports-exclus-idUSKCN1UD2LN that Canada opposed U.S. plans to import drugs, based on talking points for Canadian officials obtained through a freedom of information request. 
A government source said on Friday that Canada's message to the White House and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has been that importing drugs from Canada will not have any significant impact on prices or access for Americans.
At least ten U.S. states, including Florida, have passed or proposed laws to allow such imports from Canada, and as of Friday there is federal approval.

Some of Canada's major distributors are subsidiaries of U.S. companies, who are unlikely to participate in a program to lower prices, since their revenue reflects a cut of the value of the drugs they provide to pharmacies in the much larger U.S. market.

The suits, filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, named U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and the Customs and Border Protection agency and challenge what they call the unlawful escalation of the U.S. trade war with China through the imposition of a third and fourth round of tariffs.
The legal challenges from a wide variety of companies argue the Trump administration failed to impose tariffs within a required 12-month period and did not comply with administrative procedures.
The companies challenge the administration's ""unbounded and unlimited trade war impacting billions of dollars in goods imported from the People's Republic of China by importers in the United States,"" according to a suit filed by auto parts manufacturer Dana Corp.
The suits challenge tariffs in two separate groups known as List 3 and List 4A."" List 3 includes 25% tariffs on about $200 billion in imports, while List 4A included 7.5% tariffs on $120 billion in goods.
One suit argues the administration cannot expand tariffs to other Chinese imports ""for reasons untethered to the unfair intellectual property policies and practices it originally investigated.""
Companies filing suit include heavy truck manufacturer Volvo Group North America, U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys, clothing company Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL),  Sysco Corp  (NYSE:SYY), guitar manufacturer Gibson Brands, Lenovo's U.S. unit, Dole Packaged Foods, a unit of Itochu Corp and golf equipment manufacturer Callaway Golf (NYSE:ELY) Co.
Home Depot's suit noted it faces tariffs on bamboo flooring, cordless drills and many other Chinese-made products. Walgreen, a unit of the Walgreen Boots Alliance, said it is paying higher tariffs on products like ""seasonal novelties; party, first aid, and office supplies; and household essentials."" 
Lighthizer's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
On Sept. 15, the World Trade Organization found the United States breached global trading rules by imposing multibillion-dollar tariffs in Trump’s trade war with China.

The Trump administration says tariffs on Chinese goods were justified because China was stealing intellectual property and forcing U.S. companies to transfer technology for access to China’s markets.

107,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 01:40PM ET</span>",Turkish rate hike needs follow through for real game change,"By Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - Turkish policymakers are no strangers to unexpected action when in a tight corner, but analysts said Thursday's surprise interest rate hike could herald a change of tack on monetary policy.
Although raising rates by 200 basis points during a global pandemic and slump is unusual, analysts welcomed the Central Bank of Turkey's (CBT) response in the face of rising inflation.
""It was a bold move by the CBT which should restore credibility and improve investor sentiment,"" said Christian Wietoska at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), calling it a ""game changer"".
The hike was swiftly followed by a banking watchdog announcement that limits for banks' FX transactions with foreign entities would be raised, allowing for increased market access and reversing a decision from earlier this year.
""Encouraging moves - suggests the Turkish authorities finally get it,"" Timothy Ash at BlueBay Asset Management said.
Turkey has frequently squeezed offshore currency markets and its President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sees foreign investment in Turkish financial markets as a hotbed of speculation and has lambasted high interest rates.
The central bank said on Thursday that it hiked its policy rate after a fast recovery from the initial coronavirus shock sent Turkish inflation higher than expected.
Thursday's actions were small steps in restoring confidence, which has been sapped by restrictions on offshore lira markets that have seen trade volumes shrivel in London.
""The answer to foreigners trying to sell lira is not make it harder to sell, as this just encourages people to get out while they can and will deter them coming back,"" Ash added.
Although Turkey's hike takes its benchmark rate to 10.25% and pulls interest rates level with 12-month inflation expectations, analysts expect Ankara will have little choice but to ramp up interest rates to 12% by year-end.
""The rate needs to be 100 or 200 basis points above inflation – then we can get much more structurally constructive on the lira,"" Tatha Ghose, FX & EM analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), said.
Turkey will also need to cement its commitment to tackling inflation and returning to a more orthodox monetary policy, though this comes at a difficult time after its economy contracted nearly 10% in the second quarter and is expected to shrink in 2020 as a whole.
""Unless this is seen as a permanent situation, that the monetary experiment of cutting rates to lower inflation rates is over, unless that happens it will not work anyway – it will just be a temporary relief (for the lira),"" Ghose said. 
In the run up to the central bank meeting, Erdogan had voiced his support for lowering rates, he added.
While the battered lira  enjoyed a rare bounce in the wake of the interest rate hike, most of the gains faded quickly, showing investor scepticism about how this will filter through into financial market rates, the need for further moves and how sustainable it can be in the already ailing economy. 
The lira is one of the worst performing developing currencies so far in 2020 and has more than halved in value in just three years. 
And rising redemptions of corporate foreign exchange loans in October and November combined with very low FX reserves could put fresh pressure on the Turkish currency,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s Dirk Willer said.
The International of Institute Finance estimates that private sector external loan repayments amount to nearly $10 billion in the coming two months. 

Latest data showed net FX reserves have slipped to $18.8 billion and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimates Turkey has burnt through nearly $80 billion in 2020 on propping up the lira.

108,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 01:35PM ET</span>","G7 ministers back extension of debt freeze for poorest nations, urge reforms","By Andrea Shalal, Tetsushi Kajimoto and Leigh Thomas
WASHINGTON/TOKYO/PARIS (Reuters) - G7 finance ministers on Friday backed an extension of a G20 temporary freeze in debt payments and recognized the need for broad debt relief in the future, while taking aim at G20 member China over a lack of transparency in its lending.
The G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), approved in April, is aimed at helping developing countries get through the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. So far, it has helped 43 countries defer $5 billion in official debt service payments.
However, in a joint statement, the G7 ministers said they ""strongly regret"" moves by some countries to skip full participation in the DSSI by classifying their state-owned institutions as commercial lenders.
While the statement did not mention China specifically, G7 officials said the message was clearly aimed at Beijing, which has failed to include loans by state-owned China Development Bank and other government-controlled entities in its official debt totals when dealing with countries seeking debt relief.
""China's participation in DSSI is totally insufficient,"" Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters after a G7 teleconference. ""I told (the) G7 that we must apply further pressure on China, that DSSI needs to be extended beyond this year-end deadline, and that we must ensure burdens will be shared fairly by all creditors.""
Restrictions enacted to combat the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected nearly 32 million people worldwide, have hit poor countries especially hard and threaten to push over 100 million people into extreme poverty. The pandemic will force many countries that already faced crushing debt levels before the crisis to restructure their loans or face default.
G7 ministers acknowledged that some countries will need further relief beyond the current freeze in official bilateral debt payments, and urged the Group of 20 major economies and Paris Club creditors to agree on common terms for restructuring those debts by an Oct. 14 meeting of G20 finance ministers.
""This is not just a liquidity crisis, we need to tackle debt sustainability and go for debt cancellation,"" said Iolanda  Fresnillo  (LON:FRES) at Eurodad, a network of 50 non-governmental organizations from 20 European countries. ""By just postponing the payments you are not solving the problems these countries are facing.""
Friday's statement reflects growing recognition that the program has fallen short of its targets. The savings made are far short of the $12 billion initially projected, with some 30 eligible countries choosing not to ask for forbearance for fear of harming their ability to borrow in the future.
The ministers said the initiative should be extended ""in the context of a request for IMF financing,"" a nod to the Fund's strict conditions for global lending, and called for development of a new term sheet and memorandum of understanding to improve implementation of the G20 initiative.
That effort should focus on key features for debt treatment beyond the temporary freeze and ""fair burden sharing among all creditors,"" they said.
In addition, all claims classified as 'commercial' under DSSI would be treated as such in future debt treatments and for implementation of IMF policies, the ministers said, a policy that could leave China's lending more exposed in the event of a future restructuring.
""Pressure is mounting on China,"" said Eric LeCompte, a United Nations finance expert. ""They're being very specific here. All Chinese government entities should stop taking debt payments from poor countries.""
The ministers called again on private lenders to participate when requested, noting that their absence from the process has limited the potential benefits for several countries.
The G7 finance ministers' backing for an extension will smooth the way for a decision by the larger G20, with a formal decision likely at their leaders' summit in November.

Writing in a tweet, World Bank President David Malpass welcomed the G7's call for an extension, more debt transparency, and action on debt relief beyond just suspension and urged speedy action to help poor countries.

Throughout the pandemic Fed officials have taken solace in the fact that it has not yet led to a wave of mortgage, business or other defaults that could cripple banks, cause them to stop lending, and deepen the recession.
But ""the economic recovery...is far from complete,"" George said in remarks prepared for delivery via the web to the Independent Bankers of Colorado. ""Strains on household and commercial balance sheets since March have created fragilities that could yet threaten bank profitability and loss-absorbing capacity for some time.""
She is the second Fed official, along with Boston Federal Reserve bank president Eric Rosengren, to explicitly warn this week that credit strains could still mount as the recession and health crisis persist.
Community banks in particular, George said, given their exposure to volatile agriculture markets and the strained commercial real estate industry, ""must remain vigilant.""
""Strained business revenues and commodity prices threaten the ability of some borrowers to repay their obligations,"" she said.
George also said she was concerned that the pandemic and recent regulatory changes may speed consolidation in the banking industry, with ""both regulation and monetary policy...tilting the scales in favor of larger banks.""

Arguments to ease capital requirements for larger banks are ""not compelling,"" George said, noting that larger firms ""distributed more than $50 billion of capital through shareholder dividends and share repurchases"" even as the pandemic took hold.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Hungary wants to kickstart its economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic by boosting investments and reducing taxes, Prime Minister Viktor Orban told Reuters on Friday, adding that extending the government's job support scheme was a backup plan. 
Nationalist Orban, who has been in power for more than a decade, faces the toughest challenge of his rule now as the economy is expected to shrink by up to 6% this year while new COVID-19 infections are surging.
Hungary's weakened economic prospects could represent a threat to Orban - once dubbed a ""dictator"" by the former head of the EU's executive in Brussels - as he prepares to face parliamentary elections in the first half of 2022.
The economy, along with a strong anti-immigration campaign, has been a major vote-winner for the premier whose tax policies have favoured families and relied strongly on the auto industry.
""Investment, investment, investment. Tax reduction and investment,"" Orban said in an interview in Brussels when asked how he would try to improve the economy. ""We concentrate on investments because if we have investments we have jobs.""
This, he said, would be enough to get growth going again, even without Hungary's share of the European Union's new recovery fund worth 750 billion euros for the whole bloc. 
When asked if the government would extend a job support scheme which expired a month ago, he said: ""If there is a reason to do so we will do it but up till now we concentrate more on investment.""
The economy shrank 13.6% in annual terms in the second quarter, the deepest contraction on the EU's eastern flank, and the recovery is expected to be slower than previously expected. [nS8N2F006P] 
Asked about the forint currency, which dropped to five-month lows versus the euro this week prompting a surprise rate hike by the central bank on Thursday, Orban said the exchange rate was the central bank's job. 
""The National Bank is independent and I trust the national bank so it's not my job, simply. It's the policy of the national bank,"" Orban said. 
""If they create a strong one (forint), I have to adjust the economic policy to the strong one. If they create a weaker one I have to adjust to a weaker one.""
He also stood up for central bank Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy, a long-time ally, saying he enjoyed his full confidence.

""If you look at the figures of the Hungarian economy of the last several years, they are splendid, and it's partly due to the national bank. Facts create trust.""

113,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 09:36AM ET</span>","Price of vice: Norway eyes cut in 'sin' tax on alcohol, sugar to spur spending","By Victoria Klesty
HALDEN, Norway (Reuters) - Norway’s tipplers and sweet tooths may no longer feel a need to leave the country to stock up on their favourite vices.
The Nordic country's ruling party has proposed cutting its famously high ""sin"" taxes on alcohol, cigarettes and sweets and other consumer goods after the coronavirus lockdown showed how much business is lost every year to Norwegians flocking to neighbouring Sweden to snap up such items at cheaper prices.
Restrictions on travel between the Nordic neighbours imposed to contain transmissions of the coronavirus triggered a jump in retail sales, especially in regions bordering Sweden.
Norwegian authorities are keen to keep that trade humming to mitigate the economic downturn inflicted by the pandemic, even after any return to the open borders that have prevailed for almost 70 years of economic integration in the Nordic region.
Norway sealed its borders to all non-residents in mid-March before easing movement from June but imposing a 10-day quarantine on those returning from abroad, a rule that continues to deter traditional shopping runs to Sweden. 
""The closure of borders because of the coronavirus created a full-scale experiment in what happens when all trade is moved back to Norway,"" said Vetle Wang Soleim, a Conservative MP on a party committee that presented the tax cut proposal. 
Trade from Norwegians buying goods in Sweden plummeted by 99% in the April-June period compared with the year-ago period, Statistics Norway data showed. 
Nationwide, retail sales rose 10% in April-July, and 20% or more in some regions bordering Sweden already in March. 
(Graphic: Norway retail sales Jan-July 2020 vs 2019 - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/NORWAY-ECONOMICS/yxmvjbrmxvr/chart.png)
The tax cut initiative has been presented as a way to recapture trade lost to Sweden since the pandemic has shown high ""sin levies"" were not necessarily deterring Norwegians from indulging in booze, cigarettes and chocolates. 
""For us now, the most important priority is to move jobs back to Norway. We just prefer them to buy these goods on the Norwegian side of the border,"" Wang Soleim told Reuters.
Food in Norway is broadly 35% more expensive than in Sweden, and alcohol prices 67% higher, according to Statistics Norway.
In a scenario where cross-border trade stopped indefinitely, Norway would boost revenues from food, drink and other consumer good sales by at least $1.3 billion, according to an analysis by consultancy Menon Economics. 
It would also mean 8,200 new jobs and $410 million more in tax revenue on top of the special levies on alcohol, sugar and tobacco, it said. 
CIGARETTES, SODA FLY OFF THE SHELVES
In Sarpsborg, an industrial town in Norway's southeast 30 km (19 miles) from the Swedish frontier, staff at the Kiwi supermarket have been scrambling to cope with surging footfall, with sales rocketing by 85% in April-August.
""We are selling much more of everything now - especially minced meat, an extreme amount of soda, cigarettes and snuff tobacco,"" said store manager Carina Andresen.
""We have always known there were many people who went to shop in Sweden, but not that it was so many, and for so much.""
(Graphic: Map of Southeast Norway and Western Sweden - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/NORWAY-ECONOMICS/jbyvrmqolpe/chart.png)
In Halden, a town 12 km from the border, sales at the local wine and liquor store tripled during the summer months compared with last year, with vodka priced at 400 crowns ($42) a litre snapped up by more tourists and holiday cabin owners.
""We also sell much more boxed wine. People don't just buy one or two boxes, but four or five at a time,"" said store manager Anneli Christiansen, who had to hire four more staff at the start of lockdown in March to handle soaring demand. 
(Graphic: Vinmonopolet sales 2020 vs 2019 - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/NORWAY-ECONOMICS/xklpyqdabpg/chart.png)
""SO EMPTY"" ON SWEDISH SIDE
Towns on the Swedish side of the border, by contrast are starved of trade these days. 
Many shopping malls sprang up in recent decades to cater almost exclusively to Norwegians, but now sit nearly empty.
In the municipality of Aarjaeng, trade with Norway supports about a third of jobs, said municipal board chairman Daniel Schuetzer. ""It has been so empty in the area. There is a certain resignation - people wonder how they are going to make ends meet when a large part of your market disappears overnight.""
Others worry about future ties between two countries that have placed free movement of people and goods at the core of their relationship, well before much of the rest of Europe did. 
Georg Andren, governor of Sweden's Vaermland region, said that companies may be less willing to invest there, and, in the longer term, ""what is at stake is the social fabric"". 
The Norwegian Conservatives' proposed tax cut has elicited broad political support, although their coalition ally the Christian Democrats oppose lowering levies on alcohol. 

The rightist opposition Progress Party, which generally backs government budgets, has swung behind the proposal in keeping with its view that Norwegians' heavy tax burden should be eased across the board.

An extraordinary year is shuffling into its final stretch and it's packed with blockbuster events -- the race for a coronavirus cure or vaccine, a seismic U.S. presidential election and a possible no-deal Brexit that would end a 3-1/2 year long UK-Brussels standoff with a bang.
Squaring the books after Q3 will be interesting too. 
Markets have lost altitude lately but top tech stocks, while some 20% off peaks, are still up 65% year-to-date. Chinese shares have leapt 13%, while a dollar that spent recent months slumbering could suddenly be heading for its best month since 2016.

2/ STIMULUS AND VACCINES
By now we were meant to have resumed shopping, dining, travelling and commuting. Instead, regional lockdowns are returning, the global COVID-19 deathcount is marching toward a million and stocks are swooning. 
All that has trained market focus on stimulus and vaccines. Governments from Canada and Britain to Thailand are stepping up on the former. The U.S. Congress is dithering over further relief but the possibility of mass evictions and defaults in an election year may persuade lawmakers to break the deadlock.
As for vaccines, several companies are conducting final-stage clinical trials; any signs of their efficacy would likely boost sentiment. 
The COVID resurgence has ended talk of V- or U-shaped bouncebacks. Without more stimulus or vaccines, the trajectory could end up looking like a W or even an L.

3/PAYROLLS FRIDAY
September U.S. jobs data, out on Friday, will be watched even more closely than usual over growing concern on lawmakers' failure to agree on fresh fiscal stimulus to protect the economy. This will also be the final monthly gauge of the U.S. jobs market before Election Day on Nov. 3. 
Analysts polled by Reuters expect payrolls rose 875,000, after growing by 1.371 million in August. Recent data, including weekly jobless claims, suggest a nascent economic recovery may be fading as the effects of the last fiscal stimulus wane.
Fed chief Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday told lawmakers that fresh fiscal stimulus could make the difference between a continued recovery and a much slower economic slog. 
But a new deal before the presidential election looks unlikely, dimming the prospects for stock markets already hurt by election uncertainty and concern about the economy. A weak payrolls number could add to the angst.

Preliminary September euro zone inflation data is out Wednesday and, rest assured, the ECB will be watching closely.
August inflation turned negative for the first time since May 2016. With the economy showing signs of weakening amid the coronavirus resurgence, concern is growing. ECB board member Fabio Panetta warned that inflation remains ""uncomfortably"" below its near-2% target.
Market-based inflation expectations, closely tracked by rate-setters, are also flashing warnings, having fallen to two-month lows. No wonder that speculation about another round of ECB stimulus before year-end is building, as are expectations for a rate cut in 2021.

5/ BANKING ON A DEAL?
European policymakers have stopped worrying that the region's banks are too big to fail and instead fret they are too small to survive. 
Average return on equity - a measure of profitability - at European banks is around 7%, half that of their American peers. The STOXX Europe 600 bank index (SX7P) has fallen back below levels hit during the 2008 crisis and hovers off record lows. 
For regulators, deals may be the only way out of the malaise. They are trying to make tie-ups easier -- helping drive mergers of domestic retail lenders in Italy and Spain this year. 
Now focus is on banking giants, with sources saying UBS examined a tie-up with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) earlier this year.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) hinted this week it could join the fray once it finishes its latest overhaul. 
Muted share price reaction suggest investors have limited confidence mega deals can be pulled off just yet. But with losses caused by COVID-19 set to crystallise in the coming months, some may soon have no other option.

Investing.com -- Stocks are set to drop for a fourth straight week, durable goods orders are likely to offer little support. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s getting into Cloud-based gaming; Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s tax agony in the EU drags on; Italy's doing better with Covid-19 second time around and the Republican Party promises an orderly transition of power after November. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, September 25th.
1. Stocks on course for 4th weekly drop
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower again after a modest bounce on Thursday, as fears for the economic outlook keep equities on course for a fourth straight week of losses.
By 6:45 AM ET (1045 GMT), Dow Jones Futures were down 200 points or 0.8%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was down 0.7% and NASDAQ Futures were down 0.6%.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Costco (NASDAQ:COST), which reported better-than-expected earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, helped by renewed evidence of stockpiling by consumers anticipating a return to more restrictive public health measures to contain the coronavirus.
2. Durable goods due, Italian business confidence surprises
U.S. durable goods orders for August dominate an otherwise largely empty data calendar. Core durable goods, which strips out volatile and ‘lumpy’ elements such as aircraft, are expected to have risen 1.2% from July, a further slowdown from an initially strong recovery in the summer.
Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, noted that while the trend to working from home is likely to support purchases of durables for some time – especially office-related equipment – it also depresses business investment in comparable items, leaving the aggregate data little changed.
In Europe overnight, Italy rounded off a week of business confidence surveys with a surprisingly strong reading, reinforcing the impression that it is dealing with the second wave of the coronavirus far better than it dealt with the first.
3. Amazon launches Cloud gaming service
Amazon followed Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in unveiling a Cloud-based gaming subscription service, in further evidence of the tech giants pitching for more business from consumers stuck at home.
The service, to be called Luna, will debut on Thursday for a price of $5.99 a month and an option to buy a controller for $50.  Earlier this week, Microsoft had agreed to pay $7.5 billion for ZeniMax media, the owners of videogame publisher Bethesda Softworks.
The service was one of a handful of new products and services presented by Amazon at a corporate event on Thursday. Other items announced included new speakers and security-related devices.
However, there was no sign of Amazon entering the market for connected exercise devices, rumors of which had hit Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) shares earlier in the week.
4. Republicans promise orderly transition
Senior Republicans promised an orderly transition of power after the elections in November, a day after President Donald Trump refused to make such a commitment on fears of electoral fraud.
Senate Leader Mitch McConnell tweeted that there would be an “orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792,” the year of George Washington’s re-election.
Trump’s concerns about abuse of mail-in ballots were batted away on Thursday by FBI director Christopher Wray, who was appointed by Trump himself. Wray told the Senate Homeland Security Committee that ““We have not seen, historically, any kind of co-ordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it’s by mail or otherwise.”
5. EU appeals Apple court ruling          
Apple’s tax dispute with the European Union is set to continue, possibly for a year or more. The EU Commission said on Friday it will appeal a ruling by the European Court of Justice.
The ECJ earlier this year had struck down an order by the Commission to Apple to pay back some $15 billion in taxes to Ireland on the grounds that the tax agreement between the two broke EU antitrust law.

118,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",Argentina Inc fears 'virtual default' as FX noose tightened,"By Jorge Otaola, Walter Bianchi and Eliana Raszewski
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine companies are facing an increasingly difficult task to keep up with payments on dollar debt, hiking the risk of a wave of corporate defaults after the country tightened access to foreign currency to stem a sharp decline in reserves.
The central bank move, which pressured firms to restructure their debts and tightened individuals' access to greenbacks, jolted local markets, pummeled bond prices and equities and heightened demand for black market dollars.
The measures mean companies with debt payments greater than $1 million per month between mid-October and the end of March next year can only cover 40% of that in foreign currency, in effect forcing them to refinance the remainder.
""The source of financing is running out. We are talking about companies whose cash flows are local and cannot acquire foreign currency. It is crazy,"" said Mariano Sardáns, director of Argentine asset manager FDI International.
""This is a death warrant for many firms, or even directly means default for these companies. They run out of financing, they are out of the game.""
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) in a report said the measures negatively impacted the ability of local firms to pay back debt on time. It said there were $1.253 billion in capital repayments on ""negotiable obligations"" debt instruments due in the October-March period.
""In this context, we see Argentine companies taking defensive positions, significantly reducing their expansion plans and reviewing their cost structures,"" the agency said.
Major firms with payments due, according to Moody's, include state energy giant YPF (BA:YPFD), Banco Hipotecario, real estate group IRSA SA (BA:IRSA), agriculture firm  Cresud  SA (BA:CRES), and renewable firm Genneia SA [EMGSD.UL].
The companies declined to comment. YPF has already restructured part of the debt and does not expect refinancing problems.
""This is a step never taken before, which puts firms in a situation of virtual default beyond the credit risk that they have,"" said an Argentine executive at an exporting firm facing around $20 million of payments in December.
The executive, who asked not to be named, said his firm would present a tentative restructuring plan to the central bank before Sept. 30.
""This measure where they oblige you to enter a restructuring and do not give you clarity on what happens if there is no success in that restructuring is unprecedented.""
Argentina Inc was already facing a tough future. The economy is emerging from a sovereign default and is set to contract around 12% this year, which would mark its third straight year of recession.
The economy plunged a record 19.1% in the second quarter of the year and unemployment has spiked to a 16-year high. Reserves have dwindled, while the additional foreign currency controls have hammered investor confidence.
The rules also led to commercial banks halting sales of dollars to savers as they adapted to the new system. Argentines could already only buy a maximum $200 per month. The central bank has moved to reassure savers over access to dollars.
With the new rules, firms would still have the option of buying dollars in informal markets, but dollars there are around 80% more expensive than the official rate due to high demand.
An official at another Argentine firm facing the issue said he was concerned about how the company's reputation would be affected by forced renegotiations with creditors, despite having the liquidity and the resources to face its debts.
""This continues to generate a lack of confidence in the country,"" he said.

The ECB currently strives to steer inflation over the medium term to a rate ""below, but close to, 2%"", but has undershot it for years despite massive injections of monetary stimulus into the economy to boost prices. 
Villeroy, who is also head of the French central bank, said that the target was ""symmetric"" in the sense that it is not a ceiling - as it is sometimes seen - and the ECB could tolerate overshooting for sometime without tightening policy.
""The Governing Council has frequently re-affirmed its commitment to symmetry,"" Villeroy said in an online speech to the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum.
""Nevertheless, we should examine whether the current formulation casts doubt on this,"" he added.
Not only does the ECB need to discuss the precise formulation of its target, he said, but it also needs to take a second look at its inflation gauge, and possibly include ""owner occupied housing"", as the U.S. Federal Reserve does.
The Fed gave less weight to worries about high inflation in a major a revision last month of its monetary policy approach, putting pressure on the ECB to take a hard look at its framework for decisions in its policy review. 
With inflation still mired below the ECB's target, Villeroy dismissed ""chatter"" that it was running out of ammunition and said there should be no doubt about its determination and capacity to act further.

""If needed, the ECB has ample room for manoeuvre,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - New York retained the top spot in a survey of global financial centres on Friday, with London strengthening its position in second place just over three months before Britain's full departure from the European Union.
The Global Financial Centres Index (GCFI) is based on a survey by the Z/Yen Group in partnership with the China Development Institute of more than 54,500 assessments collected from 8,549 professionals working in the sector.
The assessments look at political stability, regulatory environment, availability of skilled staff, quality of life, infrastructure, availability of capital, market liquidity, reputation and cultural diversity.
""GFCI 28 shows increased confidence in the leading financial centres, but a general reduction in confidence in other centres,"" said Michael Mainelli, executive chairman of Z/Yen said in a statement.
Uncertainty about trade, political stability, and the economic impact of the pandemic has injected more volatility into the index results, he said.
""New ways of working are challenging the concept of a traditional financial centre. For example, the physical City of London has had an economically torrid Covid-19, while financial services in Southeast England have had a bumper year.""
Shanghai overtook Tokyo to take third place, with Hong Kong and Singapore in fifth and sixth places.
While London closed the gap with New York in the latest survey, some respondents said that the impact of Brexit could reduce the attractiveness of the UK capital, hitherto used by global banks as their EU gateway, in the short to medium term.
The City of London loses unfettered access to the EU on Dec. 31 after Brexit transition arrangements end, with future access to EU customers set to be patchy.

WASHINGTON/TOKYO (Reuters) - G7 finance ministers are expected on Friday to signal their support for extending a debt relief programme aimed at helping the poorest countries weather the coronavirus pandemic, three sources briefed on the issue said.
The ministers of the Group of Seven advanced economies are set to meet by video conference on Friday to discuss global economic developments and the continued impact of coronavirus, which has infected nearly 32 million people worldwide.
Although the International Monetary Fund has argued in favour of extending the debt relief programme's year-end deadline by a year through 2021, the G7 ministers are likely to back an initial extension of six months, the sources said.
""There is backing for a six-month extension, and there will be discussion of the broader issue of debt restructuring,"" one of the sources said.
The G7 finance ministers' backing for an extension of the debt moratorium through June 2021 would help smooth the way for a decision by the larger Group of 20 group of major economies.
The G20 finance ministers are set to meet on Oct. 14, though the decision would likely be formally adopted by G20 leaders at their summit in November.
The G7 will debate the longer-term debt sustainability of the poorest countries that have been crippled by high debt levels even before the pandemic hit, the sources said.
The discussions reflect a growing realisation among the global community that some of them may need to have their debt restructured, they said.
The sources, all of whom have knowledge of G7 deliberations, spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak publicly. No comment was immediately available from the U.S. Treasury Department, which will host the meeting.
Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters on Friday he could not comment on what will be discussed at the G7 meeting.
Under a programme dubbed the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), the G20 major economies agreed in April to offer a freeze on debt service payments to the 73 poorest countries through year-end.
But implementation of the debt freeze has been challenging, as COVID-19 has hit the poorest countries particularly hard, triggering calls for an extension of the programme.
World Bank President David Malpass said in a blog post last week that although the G20 debt relief initiative was a good start, deeper and more lasting solutions were needed.
""The current debt payment moratorium is too shallow to provide light at the end of the debt tunnel,"" he said, adding that the IMF and the World Bank would look at ""additional steps on debt to free up resources"" at their annual meetings next month.

Financial markets are pricing in a 60% chance of a cash rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to 0.1% from 0.25% now. Yields on three-year government bonds have dropped to 0.2%, implying a 33% chance that yield curve target is also lowered to 0.10% from 0.25%.

""We believe the RBA will be acutely aware that the potential costs and risks of (easing) at this juncture outweigh the potential benefits.""
Aird said tinkering with the cash rate carries the risk of other important short-term rates falling into negative territory, which would be a clear deterrent for the RBA from here.
Earlier this week,  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp Economist Bill Evans revised his RBA rate call to predict a 15 basis point cut while National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) has said an easing is likely next month or in November.
The change in stance followed a speech by RBA Deputy Governor Guy Debelle on Tuesday where he left the door ajar for further monetary easing. 
CBA's Aird said at this stage an increase in the rate of government bond purchases was the most likely next step from the RBA on the monetary policy front. 
""We believe the RBA will not introduce new policy options until the current actions have been expanded. That leads us to conclude that monetary policy is on hold in October,"" he noted.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian government debt has jumped to nearly 25% of gross domestic product (GDP), Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Friday, after Canberra drastically increased welfare payments as unemployment surged due to COVID-19 business closures.
Government debt for the year-ended June 30 totalled A$491.2 billion ($346.6 billion), or 24.8% of the country's GDP, Frydenberg said ahead of the federal budget on Oct. 6.
That soared from 19.2% at June 2019 and was slightly higher than Australia's official forecast of 24.6% in July.
The massive fiscal stimulus has led the Treasurer to abandon a long-held aspiration to return the budget to surplus as he signalled fiscal policy will remain accommodative at least until the unemployment rate is ""comfortably"" back below 6%.
Australia is in its first recession in three decades with policymakers expecting unemployment to rise to about 10% in coming months from 6.8% in August.
On Friday, Frydenberg estimated a budget deficit of A$85.3 billion for the last financial year.
The deficit is projected to skyrocket to A$185 billion in the current financial year-ending in June 2021, more than three times the previous record of A$54.5 billion seen during the 2008/09 global financial crisis. 
At 9.7% of GDP, this would be the highest since the end of World War Two.
""The road back will be long, bumpy and hard,"" Frydenberg said.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will hold its monthly policy meeting on Oct. 6, hours before the budget, and some economists are predicting a cut to the cash rate to 0.10% from a record low of 0.25% now.

While a delayed outcome is a “tail risk,” a combination of early results, voter turnout, county-level data and the high correlation of polling errors across states suggests investors will have enough information on election night to determine the likely victor, wrote economists Michael Cahill and Alec Phillips in a note Thursday. A number of states -- including some key battlegrounds -- allow votes to be processed and counted well before election day, they noted.
“It seems fairly likely that there should be enough information on election night from states that will report results quickly for the market to be able to gauge the likely winner,” the pair wrote. “In other words, the S&P can trade the likely outcome, even if the AP does not call the race.”
With the attention of many investors turning toward November’s elections as a source of risk, the cost of hedging against a contested or delayed result is getting ever more pricey. One measure in the equity market shows the most-expensive event risk on record. Among traders’ biggest fears -- an expected record number of mail-in ballots that may not be counted for days.
Goldman says the high level of uncertainty priced into currency options may be due to “muscle memory” of outsized moves in some crosses from the 2016 vote. The uncertain growth outlook amid the Covid-19 pandemic means this election should be less decisive for market direction, they said.
“While we recognize that an especially uncertain election outcome could have a significant negative impact on risk sentiment, we think this outcome is less likely than current market pricing -- and client conversations -- seem to imply,” the Goldman team concluded.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are working on a $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package that could be voted on next week, a key lawmaker said on Thursday, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reiterated that she is ready to negotiate with the White House.
With formal COVID-19 relief talks stalled for nearly seven weeks, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal said new legislative efforts got under way this week after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony that lawmakers needed to provide further support for an economy reeling from the pandemic.
""The contours are already there. I think now it's about time frame and things like that,"" Neal told reporters when asked about the potential for new legislation.
He predicted a vote could come within days. ""I assume, since the House is scheduled to break for the election cycle, then I think next week's ... appropriate,"" said Neal, adding that Pelosi would determine when a legislative package might be introduced.
House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy dismissed the new initiative as partisan. Pelosi also faces pressure from moderate House Democrats who say they want to see bipartisan aid proposals that have a chance of becoming law.
""If it's a messaging exercise, it's worthless,"" Representative Dean Phillips, a freshman Democrat from Minnesota, told CNN. He said the effort risked looking like Senate Republicans who had unsuccessfully pushed their own partisan coronavirus aid bill.
""Many of us are getting sick of that,"" Phillips said.
Stocks reacting positively to the announcements from Congress, with the S&P reaching a session high shortly after, before paring some gains. 
Formal talks between Pelosi, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows broke down without a deal on Aug. 7, with the two sides far apart. Pelosi and Mnuchin have since spoken by phone. 
""We're ready for negotiation,"" Pelosi told reporters on Thursday, saying she had last spoken to Mnuchin on Wednesday. 
Pelosi and Schumer, who initially sought a $3.4 trillion relief package, have since scaled back their demands to $2.2 trillion. Neal said a new legislative package would be somewhere near $2.2 trillion. Some media reports said it could be $2.4 trillion. 
But it was not clear whether the White House would agree to such a sum. Meadows has said that Trump would be willing to sign a $1.3 trillion relief package. 
Meanwhile, Senate Republicans, who have not been involved directly in the negotiations, initially proposed a $1 trillion bill, which was rejected by many Republicans who thought it too large and by Senate Democrats who said it was too small. 

Senate Republicans later tried and failed to bring a smaller $300 billion bill to the floor.

128,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 05:26PM ET</span>","Mnuchin, Powell say some $380 billion in unused aid could help U.S. economy","By Ann Saphir and Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - As much as $380 billion from the U.S. Congress' last big coronavirus aid package is unused and could help households and businesses if lawmakers approve, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday. 
That is far short of the $500 billion to $1 trillion many economists had expected in new fiscal stimulus for the flagging recovery. But rising tensions between Republicans and Democrats have made a new relief package ahead of the Nov. 3 election look increasingly unlikely. 
The unused money, authorized by Congress in March as part of a $2.3 trillion aid package but not yet spent, could go a long way to tide over businesses and keep people who have lost work from losing their homes. 
""It would not cost an extra penny,"" Mnuchin told members of the Senate Banking Committee in a hearing on Capitol Hill, where he appeared jointly with Powell. Congress would need to give permission for reshuffling the money, he said. 
The Treasury still has $200 billion in unused funds earmarked to backstop emergency programs launched by the U.S. central bank after the coronavirus outbreak, Mnuchin said. 
The Fed's lending programs got far less use than initially thought, in large part because their very availability helped return disrupted credit and financial markets to more normal functioning.
Separately, some $130 billion is left in the now-expired Paycheck Protection Program that could go to help small businesses, Mnuchin said.
In addition, Powell said in response to a question from committee chair Mike Crapo, most of the $75 billion allocated to backstop the Fed's Main Street Lending Program remains unused.
The program, which has so far lent about $2 billion to medium-sized companies, could extend as much as $30 billion in loans by year's end, Powell said Thursday. 
With the Treasury committing $1 for every $8 loaned under the program, that would still leave idle $70 billion of the Treasury's backstop. 
Under Crapo's questioning, Powell agreed that some of the money - perhaps $50 billion, Crapo said - could be put to better use to help the economy, including for the paycheck protection program to help small businesses ""and after that I would say, something more for those who remain unemployed."" 
Despite a return to growth, after last quarter's sharpest economic downturn in the postwar period, 11 million Americans remain unemployed. Any money remaining from stimulus checks and extra unemployment benefits from the earlier pandemic relief package is quickly running out. 
""The risk is they will go through that money, ultimately, and have to cut back on spending and maybe lose their home or their lease,"" Powell said.
Without further government aid, he said, ""we will see, sooner or later, probably sooner, we will see that the economy has a harder time sustaining the growth that we've seen, that's the risk.""
The focus on reallocating unused sums from the earlier relief package has emerged as Congress remains deadlocked over providing new fiscal relief less than six weeks before Election Day.

Mnuchin told senators that he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had agreed to discuss stimulus further. Asked by reporters Thursday if she had heard from Mnuchin, Pelosi said ""I spoke to him yesterday. I don't know if we have a call today or not.""

“Many people in African American communities have not had very positive experiences with the mainstream banking and financial system,” he said in a virtual discussion sponsored by the Fed bank.
Just as Blacks may be reluctant to enter vaccine trials “because of a history of abuse in testing and health care, that history of abuse is exactly the same thing that people feel when it comes to financial institutions,” Bostic said.
Bostic, who is the first Black Fed president in the central bank’s 106-year history, said systemic racism was an economic as well as a moral issue. He cited a  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) study released this week finding that during the past 20 years, race-based inequalities shaved about $16 trillion from gross domestic product.
“We need to be thinking really hard about raising this issue with all banking institutions across the sector,” Bostic said.
The Atlanta Fed leader described community banks as vital to many smaller localities, especially Black-owned banks that are “the trusted source” for minorities.
While consolidation has shrunk the number of banks, he said, “we all need to be thinking hard about how do we preserve them because they play a very special role in so many communities – certainly in African American and Latino communities, but also in rural places.”

130,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 04:09PM ET</span>","Biden’s Spending to Drive Faster U.S. Recovery, Economists Say","(Bloomberg) -- Joe Biden’s plans to boost government spending would help the U.S. economy bounce back faster from the coronavirus slump if the Democratic challenger beats President Donald Trump in November’s election, according to two new reports that crunched numbers from the candidates’ platforms.
The pickup in growth will be quickest if Democrats win the Senate as well as the White House, removing an obstacle to increases in social spending and infrastructure that would be “deficit-financed in significant part,” according to a study by Mark Zandi and Bernard Yaros at Moody’s Analytics.
In that scenario, the U.S. economy could grow at a 4.2% average pace during Biden’s first term, the economists found. That compares with a likely rate of between 3.1% and 3.5% if Republicans keep the White House, the Senate or both, the report predicts.
Higher income taxes under Biden likely wouldn’t hold back private consumption too much, Moody’s said, because they would only apply to wealthier households, which typically save a big chunk of their income -- while social spending would benefit poorer Americans who have a higher propensity to spend. Democratic plans to increase corporate taxes would curtail business investment, but that impact would be smaller than the amount of funds that the government would raise.
‘Biden-lite’
Even a scaled-back version of Biden’s election platform would speed up economic growth, according to a separate study published Thursday by Nancy Vanden Houten and Gregory Daco at Oxford Economics. They envisage a “Biden-lite” program that’s more likely to get passed by the Senate, which would increase taxes and spending by roughly half the amount that the candidate is proposing.
That would spur economic growth of 5.8% next year compared with a baseline forecast of 3.7%, the economists wrote. Pursuing those policies would likely lead to interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve as early as 2023, with the economy close to full employment again, Oxford said.
Biden, who leads in opinion polls, is promising trillions of dollars of additional spending on clean energy, care for pre-school children and the elderly, and manufacturing. Trump has put more emphasis on extending the tax cuts he passed during his first term.

131,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 03:54PM ET</span>",Fed’s Brainard Seen at Top of Biden’s Treasury Secretary List,"(Bloomberg) -- Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s search for a Treasury secretary is widely seen as focusing on Lael Brainard of the Federal Reserve, a choice that would keep both Wall Street and progressives in line.
The more provocative choice of Senator Elizabeth Warren hasn’t been ruled out but is far less likely, and other possible names are being discussed for the top finance job if Biden wins November’s election, according to nine people familiar with the candidates and Biden’s thinking.
The former vice president wants to make a historic choice for the job that has always been held by a White man, some of the people said. But he also wants a Treasury pick who would be universally accepted and Brainard, a member of the Fed’s board of governors, could fit that bill. She wouldn’t upset Wall Street or progressives, two constituencies that Biden would want on his side in working toward an economic recovery and avoiding Democratic infighting.
One person who has discussed Brainard’s career moves with her said that she has expressed more interest in being Fed chair than in leading the Treasury, but wouldn’t turn Treasury down if offered.
Current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, picked by President Donald Trump, is slated to serve until 2022 at which point the president may reappoint him or choose someone else.
Warren, meanwhile, has fans who argue that she is skilled at communicating economic policy to the country and within Washington, and could help a Biden administration execute a larger-scale plan to reshape the economy than other candidates.
Financial Industry Worry
But her antipathy to Wall Street and progressive views would worry the finance industry, which has long feared her legislative and regulatory wrath.
“If the Treasury pick were Brainard, the markets would take that as a signal that Biden intends to govern as a moderate, not give in to the progressive wing, so it sends a broader message,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC. “There would probably be some measure of relief that it’s not Elizabeth Warren but someone viewed as far less hostile.
Dislike on Wall Street for Warren runs deep.
“She’s spent her entire career in Congress on a crusade against the banks,” said Thomas Simons, a strategist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) LLC in New York. “Wall Street would absolutely hate to have her as Treasury secretary.”
Ex-Fed official Roger Ferguson and Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic, both Black men, are also seen as possibilities for the job, people familiar with the matter said. Former Treasury Deputy Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin is said to be lobbying for the role, they said. Any of these candidates could land elsewhere on a Biden administration’s economic team.
Brainard, Warren, Bostic and Raskin declined to comment, as did the Biden transition team. Ferguson did not respond to requests. All of the people who discussed the candidates’ possible Treasury picks asked not to be identified because no decisions have been made.
With the election 39 days away, Biden is leading Trump by about 7 percentage points in national polls and is ahead by a narrower margin in most battleground state polls.
Mnuchin Tenure
If Trump wins re-election, Steven Mnuchin, who has served as Treasury chief since 2017, has publicly said he would serve a full second Trump term. Mnuchin declined to comment through a Treasury Department spokesperson.
Biden aides have suggested he may announce some of his Cabinet picks before the election.
Filling the role of Treasury secretary is a recruiting challenge for even the savviest of presidents and transition teams. The job usually demands a versatility unlike other cabinet posts: someone who can speak in plain language to average Americans; command gravitas with financial markets; and negotiate diplomatically with foreign finance ministers and members of Congress.
Whoever is in the job in 2021 will face an economy ravaged by Covid-19. The unemployment rate remains elevated at 8.4%, after hitting a half-century low in February before the pandemic shut down the economy. The next Treasury chief may need to navigate an impasse in Congress over stimulus funding, and work through markets to finance massive amounts of government spending.
Aware of the headwinds, Biden’s Wall Street donors have been talking up potential candidates from their own ranks, such as BlackRock’s Larry Fink or Blackstone’s Tony James.
Fink told his senior leadership team and the board that he was not interested in a job in Washington, and would remain at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), according to a person familiar with the matter.
Fink and James both declined to comment through spokespeople.
Women Candidates
Since Hillary Clinton considered candidates for the position in 2016, Democrats have agreed that the party’s next pick to lead the department would be a woman, something that people knowledgeable about the selection process still say is likely.
Obama administration alumni supportive of Brainard are casting her as a potential middle ground among all the forces that would be weighing on Biden post-election.
Progressives don’t object to her as they would a former Wall Street executive. They say that even though they don’t see her as one of their own, they give her credit for reaching out to progressives in recent years.
Brainard, 58, a Harvard-educated economist, has been on the Fed’s board since 2014. In recent years, she has made efforts to lean toward more progressive policies such as the Community Reinvestment Act. In January she gave a speech highlighting reform efforts necessary to encourage more lending in low- and moderate-income markets.
She also served as a Treasury undersecretary for international affairs under former President Barack Obama, when Biden was vice president.
Still, the progressive wing of the Democratic party may influence Biden’s personnel choices for his economic team. Nearly two dozen progressive organizations wrote a joint letter to the Biden campaign on Thursday, demanding a pledge to appoint candidates supporting more spending to create a more equitable economy.
“The pandemic and economic crisis demand the federal government respond as it did during the Great Depression and World War II,” according to the letter. Signatories include Demand Progress and the Revolving Door Project. “Candidates must match their words with action and pledge to install personnel we can rely on to follow through.
Biden has been courting wealthy bankers throughout his candidacy, even has he describes the choice between him and Trump as one between Scranton, Pennsylvania -- his working-class birthplace -- and Wall Street.
Employees of securities and investment firms poured $9.2 million in a little more than two months into the Biden Victory Fund, which raises money for Biden and the state and national Democratic parties, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The fund hasn’t disclosed donations since June 30, but super-political action committees, which file more frequently, have raised $43.3 million from industry donors through July.

The Bank of Mexico, known locally as Banxico, said the rate-setting board unanimously agreed to trim the benchmark rate by 0.25 basis points to 4.25%, for what was its 11th consecutive cut since August 2019.
For the past five rates decisions, the bank cut by 50 basis points as the economy plummeted during measures to contain the pandemic. 
On Thursday, the bank said described uncertainty and downside risks despite the economy beginning to recover in June and July.
Banxico, in a statement, highlighted continued risks to inflation, economic activity, and a possible financial shock from the coronavirus pandemic that is expected to cause the biggest recession in Mexico since the 1930s.
Despite recent rises in headline and core inflation to around 4%, the bank said it foresaw a ""stable"" inflationary outlook at above 3% in the medium and long term. But it caveated those predictions by saying the balance of risks for inflation trajectory remain uncertain.
""Taking into account the referred risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets, major challenges arise for monetary policy and for the economy in general,"" the bank said.
Banxico's rate-setters acted due to the inflation outlook and what it called ""narrow"" room for maneuver, the bank said. 

The central bank added it would take ""all necessary actions"" in the future based on new information and considering the large impact on productivity by the pandemic, as well as the ""evolution of the financial shock that we are currently facing.""

(Reuters) - The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation told Congress on Thursday that anarchist and extremist ""Antifa"" demonstrators who engaged in recent violent protests are targets of serious FBI investigations. 
At a hearing of the Republican-led Senate Homeland Security committee, Christopher Wray said that the Bureau had seen ""organized tactical activity at both the local and regional level."" 
""We have seen Antifa adherence coalescing and working together in what I would describe as small groups and nodes,"" he said. Wray added that the bureau is conducting multiple investigations ""into some anarchist violent extremists, some of whom operate through these nodes.""
Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is an amorphous movement ""who believe in active, aggressive opposition to far right-wing movements,"" according https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/who-are-antifa to the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks extremists. 
Wray stressed that while there are active probes into Antifa and other extremist groups, these organizations numerically are much smaller in number. He said that peaceful protesters, as well as criminal opportunists, who engaged in low-level vandalism and looting outnumber organized extremist groups.
In testimony before a Democratic-led House Homeland Security hearing last week, Wray told lawmakers that the largest ""chunk"" of the FBI's investigations involve white supremacist groups.
Acting DHS deputy secretary Kenneth Cuccinelli, who earlier this summer had strongly emphasized the role of anarchists in urban protests, at Thursday's hearing acknowledged there was evidence that white supremacists carried out the most lethal incidents in recent years. 
He said that DHS has acknowledge for some time that ""white supremacists act as terrorists, more people are killed. That is a higher lethality."" During Thursday's hearing, Wray only briefly referred to the involvement of ""militia types"" in recent disorders.
President Donald Trump and his allies have sought https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-protests-extremist/explainer-who-are-antifa-the-boogaloo-movement-and-others-blamed-in-u-s-protest-violence-idUSKBN23C2R1 to blame what they calls left-wing extremists for violence and looting at U.S. protests over police brutality, while local authorities and watchdog groups have often pointed to the threat posed by right-wing movements.
Wray said that the FBI had asked the Joint Terrorism Task Forces it operates in partnership with local police agencies ""to make sure they are focusing on domestic terrorism"" in addition to the international terrorism probes they historically focused on.

He said the FBI recently had ""elevated racially-motivated violent extremism"" to an investigative priority equal to its focus on Islamic State and other foreign terrorist threats.

With government funding running out on Sept. 30, the legislation would continue funding most programs at current levels, and thus avoid a government shutdown in the middle of a pandemic and ahead of the Nov. 3 elections.
The Republican-majority Senate voted 93-2 to open debate on the measure. It was unclear when the vote on final passage would take place, but Senator Richard Shelby, Republican chairman of the Appropriations Committee, told reporters it might not happen before next Tuesday.
The House passed the temporary spending bill Tuesday after Democrats struck a deal with the White House and Republicans on aid for farmers and nutritional assistance for children.
Under the agreement, a program to stabilize farm incomes would be replenished at the White House's request, while $8 billion would be added to nutrition assistance for school children at Democrats' request.
The rest of the bill generally continues current spending levels. It would give lawmakers more time to work out spending through September 2021, including budgets for military operations, healthcare, national parks, space programs, and airport and border security.

The Fed's new monetary policy framework may help to modestly boost inflation expectations, Barkin said in remarks prepared for a virtual forum. But the U.S. central bank has the freedom to raise rates if financial stability risks appear or if inflation rises too quickly, Barkin said.
""I don't see 'lower for longer' as 'zero forever,'"" Barkin said during the event organized by the Money Marketeers of New York University.
The Fed said last week that rates would remain near zero until the economy reaches maximum employment, and inflation hits the Fed's 2% target and is on track to stay moderately above 2% for some time.
""While inflation has run below our 2 percent target, as I said earlier, it is not that far-off target; with rounding, you could even call it on target,"" Barkin said in his remarks.
Given the uncertainty about the coronavirus, economy and Nov. 3 election, Barkin said during a moderated discussion that guidance focused on outcomes could be more effective than guidance based on particular dates.

Barkin said he would have also been comfortable targeting a range for inflation between 1.5% and 2.5%.

During a Senate Banking Committee hearing Thursday, the Massachusetts Democrat asked Powell what the Fed is doing to reduce inequality along economic lines in the U.S. Powell pointed to the central bank’s new policy framework, which emphasizes an inclusive goal of maximum employment and said policy makers have been “outspoken on our commitment to diversity and racial justice.”
That failed to mollify Warren, who told Powell that “words aren’t good enough on this issue.” The Fed should more stringently look at lending to Black borrowers when assessing bank mergers, implement systems for instant payments in banking and use its Municipal Liquidity Facility to prevent layoffs in state and local governments, she said.

Americans of color, particularly women, have been disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus crisis. The Black unemployment rate is now nearly double that of White Americans’, after falling to an all-time low before the crisis.
The Fed announced its new policy framework last month, after spending more than a year reviewing its practices. Lawmakers, progressive organizations and presidential candidate Joe Biden have called on the central bank to pay more attention to racial disparities.
Warren, along with other Democratic senators, has introduced a bill that would amend the Federal Reserve Act and require the central bank to specifically work to decrease and eliminate gaps in employment, wages, wealth and access to credit.
The Fed earlier this week released a proposal for restructuring the Community Reinvestment Act, the 1970s-era anti-redlining law, breaking from a plan by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which was criticized for not doing enough to aid low-income communities. The Fed has also disclosed its plans for a real-time payment system, but it’s not scheduled to be ready until at least early 2023.
Warren, who Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden considered for vice president, will have an influential role in his administration if he wins in November. Since sealing the Democrats’ nomination in August, Biden has been working to navigate the tensions between the party’s liberal wing, lend by Warren, and moderates.
The 71-year-old senator is widely seen as a potential choice for Biden to lead the Treasury Department, among other candidates. The Treasury secretary is usually an administration’s chief liaison to the Fed, traditionally holding weekly lunches together and playing a central role in vetting presidential appointments to the central bank.
The Fed’s own ranks of economists, who publish influential research and advise the Board of Governors and rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, is lacking in diversity. Only about a quarter of the organization’s 820 economists are women, and just above a quarter are minorities.

Republican and Democratic lawmakers have failed to pass any new aid since their March $2.3 trillion package, credited with helping the U.S. economy avoid even worse job loss and business failures than it has suffered. 
Much of the aid to small businesses has been depleted; extra funds funneled to the unemployed have run out; and help to the airline industry has run out, opening the door to massive layoffs starting next month. 
All of that, Evans said, ""will test the true resiliency of the U.S. economy.""
The Fed, he said, is committed to using its ""full range of tools"" until the economy gets back on track to full employment and stable prices. 
But with people and businesses in minority neighborhoods bearing an unfair and outsized burden from COVID-19 and the recession, he said, the economy needs more. 

""The longer the dual challenges of the pandemic and recession continue, the greater is the risk of deepening the already stark inequities in our economy,"" he said.

Rapid expansion in gross domestic product in the third quarter “may put the U.S. economy within reach of a sort of ‘full recovery’ by the end of 2020,” Bullard, who doesn’t vote on monetary policy this year, said in comments prepared for a virtual presentation to the Global Interdependence Center Thursday.
With real GDP possibly rising at a 10% rate in the fourth quarter, national income at the end of this year would be in reach of the average level for 2019, Bullard said. The comments contrast sharply with those of most other Fed officials, who have strongly urged for more fiscal aid to keep what they see as a tenuous recovery on track.
“These are big numbers, but not outside the realm of possibility,” he said. “I expect this rebound to continue in the U.S. as businesses learn how to produce products and services safely using simple, existing technology.”
‘Considerable Resources’
Speaking in a Bloomberg Television interview earlier this week, Bullard said that he believed the economic recovery would remain on track even without more fiscal aid.
Fiscal support, which has totaled about $3 trillion, has exceeded the actual shortfall in gross domestic product, “so in an aggregate sense there are considerable resources pledged to combat the crisis,” Bullard said in his presentation.
“Simple mortality risk-mitigation strategies hold the promise of delivering higher household incomes along with lower fatalities from Covid-19, thus improving outcomes along both dimensions,” he said. “The downside risk remains substantial and continued execution of a granular, risk-based health policy will be critical in the months ahead.”
The labor-market outlook is bright, the St. Louis Fed official said.
Many of the layoffs during the pandemic were temporary furloughs so “there is room for a substantial decline in the official unemployment rate in the months ahead.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's government launched scaled-back job support on Thursday for workers hit by the resurgent COVID-19 pandemic, but warned not everyone could be helped during an economic meltdown that is threatening millions of jobs.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak also unveiled plans to extend loan repayments for businesses and delay ending a tax cut for the hospitality sector that has been drastically hit by coronavirus restrictions.
Despite the state support, unemployment looks set to surge by the end of the year, with major employers from British Airways (L:ICAG) to Rolls-Royce (L:RR) and Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) shedding jobs rapidly.
""I cannot save every business, I cannot save every job,"" Sunak told parliament as he announced his Winter Economy Plan, which replaced a planned budget statement and set out a six-month replacement for the jobs furlough scheme.
""As the economy reopens it is fundamentally wrong to hold people in jobs that only exist inside the furlough.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his finance minister was right to warn the public that things were going to be tough.
Sunak later told reporters it was impossible to predict how many jobs his new measures would save, and that forecasts of fast-rising unemployment by the Office for Budget Responsibility and Bank of England (BoE) ""don't make for good reading"".
Britain's unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in the three months to July with 1.4 million out of work, and the BoE forecast last month it would jump to 7.5% by the end of the year if there was no replacement for the existing furlough scheme.
With the government warning further restrictions might need to be imposed to curb a second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, Sunak said the government was ready to do more if required, but added it would need to keep an eye on public finances.
At the heart of his new measures is a replacement for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the furlough scheme that supported 8.9 million private sector jobs at its peak in May and ends next month - sooner than equivalents in other countries.
Under the new ""more targeted"" programme, Sunak said government support would only be available to workers whose employers keep them on at least a third of their normal hours. 
If employers agree to pay staff a third of their salary for unworked hours, the government will contribute another third, up to 698 pounds ($890) a month.
Self-employed workers can apply for grants of up to 1,875 pounds.
Economists estimate that - depending on take-up - this will cost the government around 3-4 billion pounds over the programme's six-month life, compared with more than 50 billion pounds for the eight-month-long furlough programme.
The Confederation of British Industry, which had urged the government to adopt such a scheme, said it would help save hundreds of thousands of jobs.
But millions of people have benefited from furlough support, and Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the new programme was significantly less generous. 
""It is clear that many jobs will be lost over the coming months,"" he said.
SECOND WAVE 
The pandemic has killed nearly 42,000 people in Britain, the highest death toll in Europe, and the government is borrowing record amounts to help an economy on track for its biggest annual contraction in around 100 years.
COVID-19 cases this week showed their biggest daily increase since May, prompting the government to order bars to close early and people to work from home again.
The opposition Labour Party criticised the delay in introducing the jobs measure, which it said had hurt business confidence, while the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services trade union, Mark Serwotka, called it ""a plaster to cover a gaping wound"".
The Resolution Foundation think-tank said many businesses had little incentive to use the scheme, as it would be cheaper to have one full-time employee than two staff working part time.

Sunak also plans to extend a cut to value-added tax for hotels, cafes and restaurants until March 31. Additionally, businesses will be given 10 years to repay government-backed loans rather than six. ($1 = 0.7839 pounds)

143,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>",Belarus faces imminent sanctions as pressure mounts on Lukashenko,"By Arshad Mohammed, Matt Spetalnick and Robin Emmott
WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United States, Britain and Canada may impose sanctions on Belarus as early as Friday, four sources told Reuters, and the European Union told President Alexander Lukashenko it did not recognise him as the country's legitimate leader.
Diplomatic pressure on Lukashenko mounted a day after he had himself sworn in for a sixth term at an inauguration ceremony that was kept secret until after it was completed.
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that following the ""fraudulent"" inauguration, British, U.S. and Canadian officials were working on sanctions against those responsible for ""serious human rights violations"".
The four sources said the measures could come on Friday, though that might slip given the challenge of coordinating between the three countries.
More than 12,000 people have been arrested, and hundreds remain in jail, since Lukashenko was declared the landslide winner of an Aug. 9 presidential election that the opposition denounced as rigged. 
Mass protests have left him reliant on his security forces, and backing from his ally Russia, to maintain his 26-year grip on power in the former Soviet republic.
Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said: ""The inauguration is as illegitimate as the elections it follows.""
The European Union said the abrupt swearing-in on Wednesday went directly against the will of the people.
""The so-called 'inauguration' ... and the new mandate claimed by Aleksander Lukashenko lack any democratic legitimacy,"" the EU's 27 states said in a statement.
""This 'inauguration' directly contradicts the will of large parts of the Belarusian population, as expressed in numerous, unprecedented and peaceful protests since the elections, and serves to only further deepen the political crisis in Belarus.""
The EU, a large financial donor to Belarus, also said it was ""reviewing its relations"" with the country, meaning the bloc would seek to cut off direct funding to Lukashenko's government, channelling it to aid groups and hospitals instead.
NIGHT OF PROTESTS
Lukashenko brushed off the condemnation.
""We didn't ask anyone to recognise our elections or not recognise them, to recognise the legitimacy of the newly elected president or not,"" the news site Sputnik Belarus quoted him as saying.
The 66-year-old leader defended the manner of his swearing-in.
""You know about 2,000 people were invited to the inauguration, together with the military. And it is almost impossible to keep it secret,"" he said.
The ceremony, a major state occasion that would normally be conducted with fanfare, took place without prior warning in an apparent attempt to prevent it being disrupted by protests.
Instead, it drew thousands onto the streets of the capital Minsk on Wednesday evening, where security forces chased down protesters and fired water cannon to disperse crowds.
Police detained 364 people, the Interior Ministry said.
A video showing a taxi driver rescuing a protester and speeding away from baton-wielding riot police went viral on social media.
Detained opposition politician Maria Kolesnikova urged protesters not to give up and mocked the security forces who arrested her, in a letter to her father that was shared by the Tut.By news portal.
""You must tell them not to give up, just keep going! These people who have kidnapped me are all incredibly weak and hysterical. They don't even know how to do their job well,"" the 38-year-old musician wrote.

Kolesnikova burnished her status as a hero to the protesters by ripping up her passport to avoid forced deportation to Ukraine earlier this month.

The figures are in line with other signs of a pickup in employment since mid-August.

148,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>",Wealthy Britons step up citizenship shopping to thwart Brexit,"By Sinead Cruise
LONDON (Reuters) - The number of British entrepreneurs looking to ""buy"" citizenship from countries offering visa-free access to the European Union has risen sharply, investment migration firms say, as prospects of a post-Brexit trade deal between Britain and the bloc darken.
Investment immigration firm Astons said it had seen a 50% and 30% year-on-year increase in interest from clients seeking Cypriot or Greek citizenship respectively this quarter, less than four months before UK passport-holders are likely to lose their rights to freedom of movement across the EU.
Henley & Partners also reported a rise in requests for advice on investment migration applications to Malta, Portugal, Austria and several Caribbean islands, which offer a range of residency rights, visa-free travel to the EU and citizenship to investors in local business or property.
Citizens of certain Caribbean sovereign states including St. Lucia and St Kitts & Nevis also enjoy preferred access to the EU, thanks to close ties with EU members as a result of historic, diplomatic and modern trade agreements. 
""This isn't about tourists. This is the UK high net worth community that have a constant need to travel to and spend significant time in the EU,"" said Henley & Partners director Paddy Blewer. 
""This is investment migration as a volatility hedge and a component in a high net worth portfolio value defence strategy,"" he said, adding that volumes of client engagement were higher now than immediately after the 2016 Brexit vote.
Interest in additional citizenships is rising even as the European Commission examines possible steps to curb EU states selling passports and visas to wealthy foreigners, due to concerns it can help organised crime groups.
Cypriot residency can be secured in two months with a 300,000 euro ($351,870) property purchase. Securing citizenship takes six months and requires a minimum property investment of 2 million euros.
Reuters reported in December how some donors to Britain's ruling Conservative Party had sought Cypriot citizenship including hedge fund manager Alan Howard. 
""Both Cypriot and Caribbean investments are proving very popular ... primarily driven by high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) from the UK who have an eye on the future and life after Brexit,"" said Astons spokesman Konstantin Kaminskiy.
CARIBBEAN DREAM
Henley & Partners said its volume of engagement with clients seeking alternative citizenship or residence by investment climbed 40% in the first quarter of 2020 versus Q1 2019, before flattening during the COVID-19 lockdown in Q2.
But interest has rallied since July 1, with a 15% year-on-year increase in engagement to Sept. 10, as the end of the Brexit transition phase nears.
Henley & Partners' Blewer said clients were increasingly drawn to Caribbean citizenship applications - which is likely to give them better travel access to the EU than Britain - but which have a lower minimum investment and a quicker approval process.
Saint Lucia citizenship, offering visa-free travel to 146 countries, can be obtained in around four months for a minimum investment of 76,152 pounds, data supplied by Astons showed.
For less than 40,000 pounds more, investors can obtain citizenship of St. Kitts & Nevis - and visa-free travel to 156 countries - in around 60 days.
In contrast, Malta offers citizenship in exchange for around 1 million pounds of investment, but the process takes up to 14 months. 
Portugal, meanwhile, typically processes investment migration applications in three months but only grants EU residency to investors and visa-fee travel to just 26 countries.
  ""With HNWIs, time is often more important than what is essentially a small fluctuation in cost and many are looking to secure additional citizenship as fast as possible in the pandemic landscape,"" Arthur Sarkisian, managing director of Astons, said.
EU authorities are under pressure to clamp down on investment migration programmes by member states.
Sven Giegold, a member of the European Parliament from Germany's Green party, said these kind of citizenship sales ""posed a serious threat to EU security and the fight against corruption"" in the bloc.
""EU passports and visas are not a commodity. Money must not be the criterion for citizenship and residence rights in the EU,"" he said.

OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's vow to double down on pandemic-related spending to keep the economic recovery under way in the face of a second wave of COVID-19 infections will support activity but raises questions over the burgeoning deficit, economists say.
The Liberal government on Wednesday made sweeping promises of major new investments and policy initiatives saying ""this is not the time for austerity"", while giving few details on how those plans would be financed and at what cost.
An economic update, including fiscal projections, will be released later this fall, it said.
""It seems like they've bet the farm and doubled down on spending,"" said Ian Lee, associate professor of management at Ottawa's Carleton University. ""The commitments certainly suggest that the budget deficit is going to become much larger.""
In a rare national address, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada has entered a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic and warned the country was on the brink of a surge in cases if people did not follow public health guidelines.
The government has already spent billions on pandemic aid, pushing this fiscal year's forecast deficit to C$343.2 billion ($256.5 billion), which at about 16% of GDP is the largest shortfall since World War Two.
New measures since then will likely tack another C$30 billion onto that, while next fiscal year's deficit could be around C$200 billion, Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note on Wednesday.
""Massive support programs currently underway won't fully roll off next year and, even as some do, there will be more spending to fill some of the void,"" Porter said in the note.
ALL HANDS ON DECK
The so-called Speech from the Throne included the big-ticket pledges of a national prescription drug plan and universal childcare. But economists say some of these programs could be more aspirational than immediate as Ottawa keeps some powder dry to fight the pandemic.
""If we don't survive the short term, there is no sense worrying about the medium to longer term. It’s all hands on deck,"" said Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada.
Still, an ""activist approach to fiscal policy"" could bolster the economy, leading to stronger-than-expected GDP growth in 2021 and 2022, said Stephen Brown, chief Canada economist at Capital Economics in a note.
While supporting the economy is seen as a priority in the short-term, economists look for the fall fiscal update to provide some indication of when debt will peak.
""All deficits are not created equal,"" said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets. ""When you're in such a deep hole and you're facing a pandemic head-on, most Canadians seem to be alright with spending."" 
""Where you start to get broader disagreement is: what happens when the economy has healed? Will these initiatives transition into structural deficits and that's where you really have a lot of concern,"" Mendes said.
For Carleton's Lee, the spectre of a shift from emergency measures to a larger structural deficit is very real and something he fears markets will not take lightly.

""What this throne speech is signaling is that this is not going to be temporary. They are transforming the temporary deficit into a structural permanent deficit,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks and investment firms need more ""creative solutions"" to avoid misconduct as staff are set to work from home for longer due to the pandemic, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said on Thursday.
Britain told people to work from home if possible from Thursday as new cases of COVID-19 grow again, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying the new restrictions could stay for up to six months.
Banking employees such as traders began working from home after a lockdown was introduced in March but had started returning to the office in recent weeks, where they can be more closely supervised by compliance staff.
Megan Butler, executive director for wholesale supervision at the FCA, said firms have broadly managed conduct and other risks from remote working ""pretty well so far"".
""These are all difficult questions that get harder over time as it looks like no-one is going to be back in the office anytime soon,"" she told the FCA's annual meeting.
""Industry has coped pretty well so far and we are now going to be looking to them to find perhaps some more creative, resilient solutions to these issues than perhaps some of the ones that have worked so well so far.""
Most organisations are realising that lots of controls, oversight and cultural practices are built on pre-existing relationships, she said.
""The longer working from home goes on, the more they are at risk of breaking down. The more new people come in, who you don't know, you don't know whether to trust or not, it's in those areas where I think there is still more to do,"" Butler said.
She is also surveying firms that the FCA regulates to assess how close they are to collapsing due to the coronavirus.
The FCA has surveyed 14,000 firms, with another 10,000 being asked shortly. Hundreds of firms could be at risk, a number that was expected to grow, Butler said.

The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index rose 1.9 points to 49.8 last week, data released Thursday showed. While the gauge has gained 15.1 points since hitting a six-year low in mid-May, it remains well below readings prior to the coronavirus-related shutdowns.
Gauges of comfort in personal finances and the buying climate both rose 2 points last week, while a measure of the economy gained 1.8 points. At 66.2, the finances index is just 2.4 points below its mid-March level. Such optimism may support further growth in consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the economy.
The rise in optimism in the latest week was concentrated among women and lower-income Americans. The measure among women increased 3.4 points this week to 46, the highest since early April.
Comfort among Americans with annual household incomes less than $50,000 rose 3.9 points to 40.5, narrowing the sentiment gap between Americans with lower and higher incomes.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's access to European Union markets will be rebalanced, but the City of London will not be shut out completely, the bloc's financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said.
Dombrovskis set out plans on Thursday to bolster the EU's own capital market to cut its reliance on Britain, Europe's biggest financial centre, which fully leaves the bloc at the end of December.
""We are not closing our doors to financial services in the UK,"" Dombrovskis told reporters, adding that there will be a ""rebalancing"" of British financial activities in the bloc.

""The government will directly support the wages of people in work, giving businesses who face depressed demand the option of keeping employees in a job on shorter hours, rather than making them redundant,"" Sunak told parliament. 
Sunak said the scheme would run for six months, starting in November and be open to all small and medium sized enterprises. Larger firms would only be eligible if their turnover has fallen during the crisis.
""It will support viable jobs to make sure that employees must work at least a third of their normal hours and be paid for that work as normal by their employer,"" he added. 
""The government, together with employers, will then increase those people's wages, covering two-thirds of the pay they have lost by reducing their working hours."" 
Britain's existing furlough scheme, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which supported around 9 million jobs at its peak in May, is due to stop at the end of next month. It is expected to cost around 50 billion pounds ($64 billion).
Around 5 million jobs were still supported by the programme at the end of July, according to tax data, and earlier on Thursday Britain's statistics agency estimated that one in eight workers were being helped by the programme in early September.

The Federal Reserve’s aim to let inflation run hot draws mostly derision across Wall Street after the central bank has failed to lift prices toward its 2% target for years. Why will this time be different? Add growing productivity bottlenecks into the mix with America’s surging deficit, a long-running problem of course, and the fact that the U.S. dollar is losing it’s luster.
“If you think about what the Fed’s inflation averaging means, it means they might be happy to see inflation move over time from 1% to 2% to 3% to 4%, while interest rates remain close to zero,” said McLennan, head of the global value team at First Eagle, which manages about $101 billion in assets. “That also means that real interest rates go down more.”
The fresh wave of deglobalization underfoot and second phase pandemic affects both bode poorly for productivity, said McLennan, who was co-portfolio manager of the global equity partners group at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management in London prior to joining First Eagle in 2008. That means, for him, that inflation reignites amid a backdrop of slow economic growth.
Continued weakness in the dollar, with the Bloomberg Spot Dollar Index down about 9% from this year’s high in March, buoys inflation through rising import prices as well.
Among the array of products McLennan helps manage is the $43 billion Global Fund, which had gold as it’s biggest holding at about 13%, according to Bloomberg data as of Aug. 31. Another one he steers, the U.S. Value Fund, had  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL)., Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) Co. as it top three holdings.
The Fed targets inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditure price index. It also pays close attention to a core reading of that gauge which strips out volatile food and energy prices. Both barometers have plummeted since the pandemic.
There are other notable investors and corporate heads warning on inflation. Earlier this month Stan Druckenmiller said there’s a chance that inflation could hit 5% to 10% in the next four to five years. And even one firm moved all its treasury into Bitcoin given inflation makes cash a losing bet now.
McLennan prefers gold over other favored fixed-income hedge vehicles like Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), given there’s a limited supply of the shiny metal. The Fed’s monetary stimulus already pushed key measures of the U.S. money supply up by double digits.
“The rate of supply growth of gold is less that 2% a year, bringing us back to the idea of scarcity value,” McLennan said.
Traders see consumer price inflation averaging about 1.6% over the next 10 years, based on so-called breakeven rates garnered by TIPS and nominal Treasuries. That’s down from an 8-month high on Sept. 1. Gold prices have also ebbed, both likely driven lower in part on the inability of Congress to agree on a phase four fiscal stimulus package.
The global recovery also risks losing steam as virus cases rise and some nations roll back reopening measures. The U.S. presidential election is another wild card.
“If we get a Democrat clean sweep it’s more likely than not we are going to see more rapid growth in the federal register and regulation” which tend to reduce productivity, McLennan said. Slow grow and rising inflation is probable with “these productivity bottlenecks coming with a Fed that’s willing to let inflation run hot.”

159,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>",Brexit and coronavirus spur EU to deepen capital market,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union on Thursday presented plans to expand and bolster its capital market to help reboot companies hit by the coronavirus and reduce the bloc's reliance on the City of London after Brexit.
Companies need to refund themselves as they emerge from recession caused by pandemic lockdowns, with Brussels wanting them to use stock and bond markets and reduce reliance on bank loans.
The plans would help give the EU market ""strategic autonomy"" when Britain exits the bloc's single market on Dec. 31, the EU launch documents said.
Digital finance forms a core plank of the bloc's third batch of measures in five years to create a Capital Markets Union (CMU) by including what EU officials describe as the world's most comprehensive set of rules for cryptoassets. 
""The strength of our economic recovery will depend crucially on how well our capital markets function and whether people and businesses can access the investment opportunities and market financing they need,"" the EU's financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement.
European Commission officials say top political support will be needed to push through the reforms after patchy success with previous attempts at building the CMU.
""There is a lack of vision for CMU on where we want to get to in 10 years' time, and on how to consolidate the hopelessly fragmented and expensive investment funds market,"" said Karel Lannoo, chief executive of Brussels think-tank CEPS. 
Pablo Portugal, managing director for advocacy at banking and markets industry body AFME said it was time that policymakers delivered on CMU. 
The collapse of German payments company Wirecard has raised questions about supervision. The CMU plans stop short of calling for a single markets supervisor, but stresses the need for more convergence.
""It is an essential condition for a well-functioning CMU. This will be particularly relevant in a post-Brexit world with multiple financial centres across the EU,"" it said.

The plans include the first set of rules specifically for supervising providers of cloud computer based services as banks outsource more and more critical information technology.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government upgraded its view on exports, factory output and employment in its September economic report but said its overall assessment was unchanged from last month, as the country continues to struggle with the coronavirus pandemic.
The world's third-largest economy suffered its worst contraction in the postwar era in the second quarter, but it has shown some signs of life since the government lifted a nationwide lockdown in late May.
With consumers and businesses still cautious as the country battles the virus, the government downgraded its view on consumer spending and business expenditure in the monthly report released on Thursday.
""The economy remains in a severe condition due to the coronavirus impact but it is showing signs of picking up recently,"" the government said in the report.
Japan's economy shrank an annualised 28.1% in the April-June period, contracting for a third consecutive quarter.
The government has sought to soften the blow of the pandemic by unveiling a $2 trillion package of stimulus measures this year, while the Bank of Japan has also eased monetary policy further in 2020. 
In the report, the government said it upgraded its views on exports and factory output for a third straight month and raised its assessment on the employment situation for the first time since January 2018.
The government said exports were ""picking up"", bettering the August assessment that they showed signs of recovery. A rebound in the economies of major trading partners was underpinning Japan's exports and factory output, the report said.
The number of people in employment was gradually recovering, the government said in the report, an improvement from its August view that the job situation was weak.
But the government downgraded its view on consumer spending for the first time in five months, saying it was ""picking up"" - as in the August report - but adding that it remained weak, along with business spending.
Despite the downgrade, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said he felt the government's subsidised domestic tourism campaign was supporting consumers' appetite for spending.
""I feel consumers' willingness to spend is solid,"" he told reporters.
Japan began offering subsidies for national travel discounts in late July to revive tourism, excluding people living or vacationing in Tokyo, which had become a coronavirus hotspot.

The government plans to include Tokyo from next month unless there is a spike in infections there.

161,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 06:52AM ET</span>","U.S. Political Risk, Jobless Claims and Dollar Strength: What's up in Markets","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Stocks are set to open in muted style, with no noticeable bounce. Jobless claims are expected to fall again slightly, and new home sales will once again give bulls something to chew on. French and German business confidence improves despite fresh restrictions in Paris. And Donald Trump refuses to commit to a peaceful transition of power in November. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, September 24th.
1. Stocks set to open mixed; Nasdaq drifts lower again
U.S. stocks are set for a very modest bounce at opening after sliding again on Wednesday in response to repeatedly gloomy comments about the economy from Federal Reserve officials.
By 6:40 AM ET (1040 GMT), Dow futures contract and the S&P 500 futures contract were both up 0.1%, while Nasdaq futures, which underperformed sharply on Wednesday, were down another 0.2%.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Accenture (NYSE:ACN), CarMax (NYSE:KMX), Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) and FactSet Research, all of which report earnings.
More importantly, investors will be looking for signs of stabilization in some of the tech stocks that have lost their luster in recent days, most notably Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which fell over 10% on Wednesday.
2. Jobless claims, new home sales due
In a week of growing fears about an economic slowdown, there may be more attention than usual on the week’s jobless claims data.
The expected picture is for another marginal improvement in the labor market, with initial jobless claims falling to 840,000 from 860,000 a week earlier, and continuing jobless claims (which come with a one-week time lag) having fallen to 12.30 million from 12.628 million a week earlier.
There will also be eyes on new home sales data, which are expected to confirm the ongoing strength of the housing market, while the Kansas City Fed business survey will be checked to see if it’s closer to the (upbeat) Richmond Fed survey earlier this week, or the (downbeat) IHSMarkit Purchasing Managers Index that was released on Wednesday.
3. Dollar weighs on commodities again
The dollar continued what many still believe to be an upward correction in an extensive bear trend, as risk aversion and the lack of any imminent further loosening of Federal Reserve policy both supported the greenback.
By 6:40 AM ET, the dollar index that tracks it against six developed-market currencies was at 94.523, just off its intraday high of 94.608, which represented a fresh two-month high. the euro drifted lower after an uneventful ""TLTRO"" refinancing operation from the European Central Bank. The dollar also hit another all-time high against the Turkish lira.
The dollar’s strength is continuing to put downward pressure on commodity prices, with U.S. crude oil prices still stuck below $40 a barrel and gold futures down 0.6% at $1,856.90, the latter having also posted a new two-month low earlier. 
Silver futures were down 3.6% at $22.28 an ounce, while copper fell 1.3% to $2.95 a pound. Those who haven’t had enough of the Powell/Mnuchin show on Capitol Hill can tune in again from 10 AM, while the Chicago Fed’s Charles Evans is due to speak at 1 PM  and New York Fed President John Williams takes the rostrum at 2 PM.
4. This is fine
President Donald Trump refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power following the election in November, arguing again – without presenting any evidence – that the widespread use of mail-in votes will result in electoral fraud.
The likely prospect of Trump issuing legal challenges to voting results in states that go against him in November has added further venom to the debate around his haste to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the weekend. Trump said on Wednesday that he wants nine justices on the Supreme Court before the election because he thinks it will end up deciding the winner.
Meanwhile in Louisville, Kentucky, protestors shot two police officers in unrest after a grand jury chose not to indict any of those involved in the shooting of health worker Breonna Taylor. The decision also triggered violent protests elsewhere, with Portland, Ore., witnessing yet more rioting.
5. France tightens restrictions as business confidence improves
European business sentiment continues to improve, but for how much longer.
Confidence surveys released for both France and Germany both pointed to an ongoing recovery especially in manufacturing, with the closely watched Ifo Business Climate index rising to 93.4 from 92.5.  The French business confidence index meanwhile rose to 96 from 92.
Both figures were the best since March, but Germany’s fell short of expectations.
The French index bested forecasts, but came against the backdrop of fresh measures announced by the government to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus. It’s the third European country this week to do so, following the U.K. and Belgium. U.K. treasury chief Rishi Sunak is due to outline fresh government spending to support the labor market later.

162,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>","Businesses cheer, unions fear contentious Indian labour reforms","By Alasdair Pal and Manoj Kumar
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Business groups on Thursday welcomed contentious and long-delayed labour reforms passed by India's parliament this week, aimed at making hiring and firing workers easier and imposing restrictions on trade unions. 
The reforms to India's decades-old labour laws are a key part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's moves to liberalise conditions for investment. But they have met with resistance from trade unions that plan to join a nationwide agitation on Friday against these and several other bills passed by the government. 
Three key bills on labour reform were approved by India's upper house of parliament late on Wednesday, and will become law after receiving presidential approval. They were approved by the decision-making lower house on Tuesday.
""This change is welcome and bound to create more attraction for foreign investments in small-scale sectors,"" said KE Raghunathan, convener of Consortium of Indian Associations, an umbrella group representing small businesses. 
""At the same time, workers might fear losing their rights in certain cases, and the onus is on the employers to make sure this feeling is eliminated."" 
Under the Industrial Relations Code, one of the three new laws, companies employing up to 300 workers will not require government permission to lay off workers or close plants - an increase from the previous cap of 100 and a major demand from industry over the years.
The code also puts restrictions on the recognition of trade unions - making it mandatory for them to represent at least 10% of workers in a given sector - and prohibit them from striking without prior notice and during conciliation proceedings.
Businessman Vinod Kumar, who employs just over 100 people at his factory making parts for India’s Tata Motors (NS:TAMO) in the north Indian city of Lucknow, said the code will help him to expand operations. 
""This will give us some power and rein in the labour unions, who have now a habit of blackmailing us in the name of increasing remuneration,"" he said. 
Rick Rossow, a senior adviser at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, who specialises in U.S.-India business ties, said the reforms were likely to prove attractive to overseas investors. 
""Foreign companies have long listed India's stifling labor regulations as a key deterrent to making larger investments,"" he said. 
The northern state of Rajasthan, that introduced similar laws for companies with fewer than 300 workers in 2014, has seen an increase in the average number of employees, he added. 
Indian state governments are allowed to pass their own labour laws, but the new codes issued by the federal government will over-ride these. 
Six states have this year already relaxed labour laws, including raising caps on work hours, in what they say is an attempt to kick-start their economies badly damaged by the novel coronavirus pandemic, to the concern of groups including the United Nations' labour wing.
Amarjeet Kaur, general secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress, one of the biggest trade unions in the country, said the new codes will make it would be almost impossible for workers at small industrial units to form a trade union.
""Workers will be at the mercy of their employers who could fire them for any flimsy reason,"" she said. 

AITUC, along with at least 10 major trade unions, will launch nation-wide protests against the labour code, and will join farmers on Friday to protest against the government, she added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Ministry of Finance is set to seek about $242 billion in debt servicing for the fiscal year from next April 1, up for a third straight year on a budget-request basis, a ministry draft reviewed by Reuters showed.
The budget request for debt redemption and interest payments would total 25.4934 trillion yen ($242.03 billion), marking a 9.2% increase from the current fiscal year ending in March, according to the draft, which was confirmed by several sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
It would exceed 25 trillion yen on initial budget basis for the first time in five years, underscoring a struggle for the heavily indebted government to finance snowballing debt that tops twice the size of Japan's $5 trillion economy.
In compiling its budget request, the ministry estimated interest rates at 1.2% thanks to the Bank of Japan's ultra-low rate policy. Still, massive outstanding debt prevented debt servicing costs from rising. 
Ministries and government offices are due to file budget requests for the next year by the end of this month.
The requests will be scrutinised by the finance ministry when it compiles a draft budget plan for fiscal 2021/22 in late December.
Due to uncertainty over the coronavirus, the government has not set a ceiling on budget requests, which made it difficult to curb spending.
The government has compiled two extra stimulus budgets for this fiscal year to cope with the virus, which will boost overall government spending to some 160 trillion yen, 1.6 times the size of an initial budget.

164,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>",A roller coaster six months leaves U.S. recovery still uncertain,"By Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As businesses shuttered and millions hit the unemployment line last spring, the most dour predictions saw the United States heading for another Great Depression of spiraling collapse and years of massive joblessness.
The worst has been avoided.
But new academic research and commentary this week from Federal Reserve officials suggest the path of the U.S. recovery remains much in doubt, and the programs approved last spring to buffer the economy from the pandemic may still be in for their stiffest test.
Cash that households socked away over the summer from rich unemployment benefits will begin to run dry; small business loans appear to have limited bankruptcies and closures so far but were not designed for the long haul; Federal Reserve programs that helped unlock a massive round of private corporate financing may have left companies with difficult-to-service debt if business does not fully rebound.
""Given the magnitude of the economic downturn triggered by the pandemic, we still face the possibility of a coming wave of credit downgrades and defaults,"" authors including Jeremy Stein, a Harvard University professor and former Fed Governor, warned in a paper being presented Thursday at the Brookings Institution, one of several which spelled out the risks facing the U.S. economy in the coming months. 
After its emergency credit programs allowed companies to sell a record $1.7 trillion in corporate bonds to private investors through August, the Fed may have to rescue those markets if the bonds start to go bad, or risk the sort of financial crisis that has so far been avoided, the authors wrote. 
The problems may not spool out all at once. But heading toward winter, when epidemiologists fear the spread of the virus will accelerate, renewed health fears may curb spending, make businesses less likely to hire and invest, and even prompt new restrictions - a phase the UK is entering, and which other European nations may face as case counts rise. 
Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said the steps taken so far ""would have been fine if the pandemic lasted three months, but the pandemic isn't lasting three months."" 
""My baseline is that the pandemic gets worse this fall and winter,"" he told Reuters on Wednesday. ""Some parts of the country will do a lockdown or people will choose to do so...Either way it is going to result in a decrease in economic activity.”
ROLLER COASTER, NOW WHAT?
In the roughly six months since a national state of emergency was declared, the U.S. economy has been on a roller coaster - plummeting in March and April, reopening and rebounding in June and July, then reaching a plateau of sorts.
The pace of the initial recovery surprised many forecasters, and recent data has provided an explanation: the massive aid rolled out in March by the government did its job and then some. 
Personal income was stable, small businesses used liberal access to loans to stay afloat, and families actually stuffed money into savings accounts as enhanced benefits gave many of the newly unemployed more than they were earning at their jobs.
A Fed report this week noted savings and checking accounts were about $700 billion higher at the end of June than in March. 
But that money will eventually be spent. Proceeds of things like Paycheck Protection Program loans to small businesses will be used, and that may well happen before the economy fully reopens. The Metropolitan Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) on Wednesday said there would be no live performances until at least September, a high-profile example of how the entertainment and hospitality industry may face an extended recession even if other parts of the economy do better. 
Congress is currently deadlocked over further aid, and it is unlikely any decisions will be made before the presidential election in six weeks.
In an analysis of the PPP program also to be discussed at Brookings on Thursday, economists Glenn Hubbard of Columbia University and Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute said it had been successful in stemming firm closures early on, but is still ""unfolding"" as the country's battle with the pandemic lengthens.
""PPP was designed for a short shutdown that would be followed by a strong and rapid recovery. But the shutdown was longer than anticipated and the recovery decelerated after a burst of improvement in May and June,"" the two wrote, advising that more open-ended programs, such as federal business interruption insurance or outright grants, might be needed.
And more help may be needed for individuals. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a congressional hearing Wednesday there should be no doubt that the progress the economy has made so far is a result of the federal actions last spring - and that it may depend on more going forward.
""The good economic data we have seen since May to a great extent reflects...the checks, unemployment insurance. It really helped keep people in their homes, keep them spending,"" Powell said. ""There is a long way to go...We need to stay with it.""

165,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>","U.S., Chinese diplomats signal tricky road ahead for climate diplomacy","By Valerie Volcovici and David Stanway
WASHINGTON/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - After several years of dismissing global action to fight climate change, U.S. leadership was formally challenged this week by China announcing bold new climate pledges. 
Former Vice President Joe Biden has pledged to reinvigorate U.S. climate leadership if he wins the Nov. 3 election against incumbent President Donald Trump. 
Re-establishing that leadership role, however, may not be so easy, according to U.S. and Chinese diplomats involved in past climate negotiations. 
The 2015 Paris Agreement hinged on a pact between China and the United States, the world’s two biggest emitters, to cooperate on climate action. Now, the United States under Trump is poised to exit the treaty on Nov. 4, the day after the election. 
And the once-careful negotiations between Washington and Beijing have unraveled to what experts say is the worst level in years. Under Trump, the United States has launched a trade war against China and blamed Beijing for the COVID-19 pandemic, while China has cracked down on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, imprisoned Uighurs in Xinjiang and escalated tensions in the South China Sea. 
This week, the situation got even trickier as China’s President Xi Jinping announced plans to be carbon neutral by 2060 and urged the world to step up to the challenge. 
Making global climate progress without reviving the U.S.-China relationship would be impossible, according to former U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern and other key figures behind the Paris agreement. 
China produces 29% of global emissions - more than the EU and United States combined. Taken together, the three regions account for just over half of global carbon dioxide emissions.
Biden’s team would need to balance the forces of competition and cooperation with China, or else renewed climate cooperation won’t get off the ground, Stern said. 
""We will have to learn to manage a relationship marked by both competition and collaboration, working with allies to stand up against unacceptable Chinese behavior where necessary, while seeking to collaborate where we can and must,"" he wrote in an essay for the Brookings Institution this month.
TABLES TURNED
In his speech at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Xi said China's CO2 emissions would peak before 2030. His pledge for China to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 also marked the country's first commitment to a long-term target.
The announcement amounted to a “framing of competition between the U.S. and China,” said Andrew Light, who served on the U.S. strategy team in U.N. climate negotiations under Obama. 
In effect, Xi set the agenda on future climate negotiations, getting ahead of pressure from a potential Biden presidency to rein its coal use and plans to build coal plants worldwide, Light said. 
Biden already has pledged that the United States will produce carbon-free electricity by 2035 and achieve net zero emissions across the economy by 2050. But his plans will require either executive action that can be challenged in court or legislation that would need to pass through Congress. 
Biden would also find the EU much more assertive on climate today, compared with during the Obama era, as the bloc has placed climate action at the center of its policy framework, pledging to impose a carbon border tax and to invest in clean technologies. 
If Trump wins the 2020 presidential election, China would take ""advantage of the fact that the U.S. has been absent on this front"" and ""enhance its global positioning"" around climate change, said Peter Kiernan, lead energy analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit.
TAKING POSITION
Officially, China insists its position on climate negotiations will remain the same, regardless of who wins the election in the United States, and claims that re-engagement with the United States is not necessarily a priority.
China's top climate official, Li Gao, said in a Sept. 7 speech that while China would ""proactively"" and ""unswervingly"" fulfill its national commitments on climate change, global political complications were making things harder.
""Under an accumulation of factors such as unilateralism, protectionism and the spread of the novel coronavirus, the handling of global climate change is facing more difficulties,"" he said.  
The Biden campaign has said the United States under his leadership would seek to work with China again on climate change, but would push Beijing to curb exports of coal technology and reducing the carbon footprint of its Belt and Road Initiative – a massive infrastructure project that would stretch from East Asia to Europe. 
China has under construction hundreds of new coal plants and could build even more in the next five years. 
The country is also expected to rely on energy-intensive infrastructure projects to try to accelerate its post-COVID-19 economic recovery.
Biden adviser John Kerry, former secretary of state and key player behind the Paris agreement, said that China’s buildout of coal domestically and abroad would negate any past progress on climate change. 
“That’s going to kill the efforts to deal with climate,” Kerry said earlier this month in a live-streamed discussion. This is why the United States needs to rebuild its climate partnership with China regardless of other disagreements, he argued. 
“We are going to have to reach out, build up, but also be absolutely firm about the things that we disagree with.” 
Cementing the U.S.-China bilateral agreement in 2014 took over four years of work and included the personal outreach of Stern, Kerry and Obama chief of staff John Podesta with their Chinese counterparts.
That same level of outreach would need to happen quickly now, including “confidence building measures” to help ease the “strong forces of nationalism in both countries,” said David Sandalow, former under Secretary of Energy under Obama and China expert at Columbia’s Global Energy Policy. 
Those measures could include reopening diplomacy in areas such as green finance, or partnerships on carbon capture technology, he said. 
That effort, even if difficult, is still possible if not essential, said Paul Bodnar, a State Department climate negotiator under Obama.
In the first year of Obama’s administration, the U.S.-China relationship “wasn’t particularly rosy,” Bodnar noted. Other nations were also wary of U.S. climate leadership, after President George W. Bush withdrew the U.S. from an earlier global climate pact, the Kyoto Protocol.
“It took us three years to dig ourselves out of the hole of distrust we found ourselves in,"" Bodnar said.
Still, he said, regardless of what else is going on in the U.S.-China relationship, they will have to find a way to work together. 

""The fate of the planet depends on it. There is no other option,"" he said.

The scams have been a focus in Germany, with the country estimating they have cost the state more than 5 billion euros ($5.8 billion) in lost tax revenue from such schemes, dubbed Cum/Ex and Cum/Cum.

SNB President Thomas Jordan and his colleagues said the franc is “highly valued” and that they’re ready to “intervene more strongly in the foreign exchange market.” They also left the policy rate and deposit rate unchanged at a record-low -0.75%.
Switzerland’s dual tack of negative rates and interventions is now in its sixth year, as officials try to prevent inflows of capital that push up the franc and increase deflationary risks. The SNB faced a tough battle in the first half of 2020, though the currency has eased somewhat in recent months, thanks in part to the European Union’s historic spending package.
The SNB said consumer prices will fall 0.6% this year and only barely increase in the 2021 and 2022.
The currency remains vulnerable to a number of risks, including Brexit and the U.S. presidential election. Also hanging over Switzerland is a U.S. Treasury report that could classify the country as a currency manipulator, potentially inviting speculators to test the SNB’s resolve to intervene.
While the central bank stepped up currency action and boosted the supply of liquidity to the market in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, it didn’t follow the Federal Reserve and others by cutting interest rates.
Swiss rates are already far below zero, though Jordan has said the SNB can take them lower if needed. Such a move wouldn’t go down well with banks, who’ve long complained about them.
As with economies everywhere, the coronavirus outbreak has pushed Switzerland into its deepest slump in years. The central bank now sees the economy contracting 5% this year, compared with a June forecast of about 6%.

171,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 12:36AM ET</span>","Covid Risk, Online Classes Spur Drop in U.S. College Enrollments","(Bloomberg) -- Fewer students are opting to attend college in the U.S., deterred by Covid-19 risk and the prospect of taking classes online.
Undergraduate enrollments dropped 2.5% for the current academic year, according data released by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. The steepest decline was among international students, with non-resident alien undergrads down 11.2%.
Higher education in the U.S. has been hard hit by the economic fallout from the pandemic. Schools were forced to close and they have struggled to reopen, with many scrapping full on-campus learning, especially after outbreaks. Students and families are very concerned about the quality of education that is delivered entirely online, said Mikyung Ryu, director of research publications.
“That is the number one major difference that may distinguish from where we are today from all other previous economic recessions,” Ryu said in an interview.
Even the most sought-after colleges are feeling the impact. Harvard University’s undergraduate enrollment fell almost 20% from last year. The freshman class is about 14% smaller, as more than 200 accepted students notified Harvard that they intend to postpone their attendance to the next academic year.
Princeton, too, has fewer students this fall, driven by those seeking deferrals and leaves. The Ivy League school in New Jersey had 4,703 undergraduates enrolled for fall 2020, compared to 5,328 students for fall 2019, or a 12% decline from Oct. 15 of last year.
In terms of overall U.S. enrollments, community colleges were the hardest hit, with a decline of 8%, the Clearinghouse reported. Public four-year universities are suffering far less with enrollments declining 0.4%. Private non-profit four-year institutions saw a drop of 3.8%.
The only gain was seen at graduate schools, with enrollments increasing 3.9% from the previous September.
The National Student Clearinghouse’s report is based on data from 629 colleges with 3.6 million students. It doesn’t reflect students taking a gap year or deferring attendance this year.
The organization will get data later in the year from more schools, and if the 2.5% holds up, that would translate into about 400,000 fewer students out of 15 or 16 million, Ryu said.
“That may be equal to wiping out two years of new enrollment,” Ryu said.

172,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 12:27AM ET</span>",Virus Forces Sunak to Spend More on Saving U.K. Jobs and Firms,"(Bloomberg) -- Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak will set out a new crisis plan to protect jobs and rescue businesses as the coronavirus outbreak forces the U.K. to return to emergency measures.
With Covid-19 spreading rapidly again, Sunak is having to provide more state support to avoid a surge in unemployment just at the moment he had planned to scale back an already huge package of aid.
The chancellor has scrapped a planned autumn budget and will set out what he called his “winter economy plan” to safeguard jobs in the months ahead, in a statement to Parliament on Thursday afternoon.
Extra state cash for wages and loans for firms will put pressure on the public finances — but after Johnson imposed fresh restrictions on the economy to tackle Covid-19 this week, Sunak has little room for maneuver.
“His challenge is explaining to businesses and workers how they’re going to have sufficient income to get them over the next few months of coronavirus restrictions,” said Nicky Morgan, a Conservative peer and former Treasury minister. “There are so many sectors that are unable to open in the way they need to and that means he doesn’t have much of a choice.”
Recession
As he tries to pull the economy out of its worst recession in more than a century, Sunak will have to balance demands for extra support with the need to keep a grip on the public finances.
The national debt surpassed 2 trillion pounds ($2.6 trillion) for the first time this year. But he also has to contend with a pandemic that’s forced fresh restrictions on the general public.
The chancellor won plaudits for innovative measures to support workers and companies during the first spike in the virus in March. But these programs are scheduled to close in coming weeks.
The loss of state support threatened to undermine the U.K.’s economic recovery at a time when ministers are again tightening restrictions on commercial activity to curb the spread of the disease.
The opposition Labour Party and business groups demanded the Chancellor come forward with plans to replace his flagship furlough program, which is due to close on Oct. 31 – or face a wave of job losses.
“I have been warning for months and months that the chancellor’s one-size-fits-all withdrawal of furlough support was a recipe for a jobs disaster this autumn,” Labour Shadow Chancellor Anneliese Dodds said in a statement.
Among the options Sunak is considering is a German-style “short hours” program to top up the pay of workers who return to their jobs part-time. It would replace the furlough program, which has paid more than 9 million workers up to 80% of their wages at a cost to the Treasury of more than 39 billion pounds so far.
Under the plans, employers would pay staff for the hours worked, and the cost of the remaining hours not worked would be split between workers, employers and the government, people familiar with the discussions said. Separate help could be targeted at companies most severely affected by the restrictions, they said.
Creative
The Treasury declined to comment on the specific proposals but an official emphasized that Sunak has promised to “act in creative and effective ways” to support jobs.
People familiar with the matter said the chancellor is also planning to extend the deadline for new applicants to several state-backed loan programs, until at least the end of November.
While Treasury officials were tight-lipped about what measures may be included in Thursday’s plan, the chancellor has been studying a range of proposals from business groups, think tanks and unions. They include:
“He’s got an unenviable task,” said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Bank Plc. “He has got to balance out the need to keep the economy going and a medium-term requirement to keep the public finances on track and maintain the U.K.’s fiscal credibility. And that is no mean feat.”
Pubs and Restaurants
Although Sunak unveiled a host of measures in the summer to support the hospitality and leisure industries, these sectors are likely to be hit more than most by new requirements outlined on Tuesday for pubs and restaurants to close at 10 p.m. and for office staff to work from home. That means they may need more assistance over the winter too.
“That is where the concentration of job losses is going to be,” Resolution Foundation Chief Executive Torsten Bell told Parliament’s work and pensions committee on Wednesday. “That is where our crisis sits.”
Johnson warned the new limits may be in place for six months, prompting a backlash from businesses, who urged the chancellor to save them from “ruin.” It also left economists warning the U.K.’s recovery from its record slump in the second quarter is in peril, while the number of new daily virus infections is now close to its peak again.
The chancellor said on Twitter his emergency plans would “continue protecting jobs through the winter.”
“The fact there isn’t going to be a budget clearly means that the economic outlook is incredibly uncertain,” said Morgan. “It also means that it’s impossible to make any immediate medium to long-term decisions about the public finances and how you might begin to repair that.”

173,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>",Russia’s V-Shaped Recovery at Risk as Kremlin Pares Stimulus,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s deputy economy minister is worried the economy’s consumer-led recovery isn’t fully cemented as the government prepares to wind back stimulus.
Curbing state support “is one of the biggest and most serious challenges for the government and budget right now,” Polina Kruchkova said in an interview in Moscow. “We think that we have jump-started growth, but we’ll see.”
President Vladimir Putin has the Russian consumer to thank for pulling the country’s economy from the brink of recession. Consumer demand helped spur a faster-than-expected recovery over the summer in large part because border closures ensured Russians spent money at home. But stimulus measures introduced during a two-month lockdown that started in late March are due to expire before the end of the year, potentially denting spending power.
The Economy Ministry revised up its estimate for this year’s contraction to 3.9% from 4.8% after data showed a jump in economic activity since lockdown measures were lifted in May. It helped that services and small businesses, sectors that were hit hardest by global lockdowns, play a relatively minor role in Russia’s total output.
Fiscal stimulus in Russia was smaller than in other countries -- totaling less than 4% of gross domestic product -- but the support still played a role in allowing the economy to bounce back, Kruchkova said.
Many of the measures, which include delays in tax payments and mortgage subsidies, will expire before the end of the year and the government is already planning to reduce spending and raise taxes in 2021.
The central bank warned last week that the recovery could slow from here and research by Bloomberg Economics suggests that demand is running up against a low ceiling, with consumer activity still lagging.
Second Wave
The recovery path is also clouded by the potential for a second wave of coronavirus after new infections accelerated again earlier this month, taking the total past 1 million. The Kremlin has so far said a new nationwide lockdown isn’t necessary.
Kruchkova, 48, who joined the ministry from the Moscow Mayor’s office in February during a government overhaul, said she and her colleagues were caught off-guard by the quick recovery following an 8% contraction in the second quarter.
But she’s remaining cautious about the outlook going into next year, particularly because consumer demand will have to be followed by a pickup in investment to ensure a sustained recovery.
“Even though we got through the lowest point better than expected, it doesn’t mean that all other stages will go as quickly and smoothly,” Kruchkova said. “There are risks to the recovery and to sustainable growth.”

LONDON (Reuters) - The world must combine COVID-19 recovery packages with massive investments in renewable energy and low-carbon infrastructure or it will fail to meet a global warming limit target, a report by leading energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said on Wednesday.
Currently, the world is on track for a 2.8 degrees Celsius to 3C rise in the global average temperature, above an internationally-agreed limit of below 2C, the report said.
""Nearly $20 trillion, or 25% of global GDP, is earmarked for spending over the next 12-18 months to deliver a coronavirus vaccine, tackle unemployment, rebuild public health systems and get economies back on track,"" said Prakash Sharma, head of markets and transitions for Asia Pacific at Wood Mackenzie.
""This investment figure only has tiny proportions allocated to the promise of the Paris Agreement targets. Some jurisdictions, such as the EU, have doubled down on green goals, but it is currently up in the air in the U.S. and China,"" he added.
One obstacle is that more than half the world's existing energy and industrial capacity - power, cement, refining, chemicals and vehicles - is young and has decades left to run its course. In addition, more than $1 trillion a year is needed to build new energy supply capacity, the report said.
Coal, gas and oil are still expected to contribute around 80% of primary energy supply by 2040, which is a far higher from the 50% maximum needed for the world to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. 

Although there is increasing renewables generation and electric vehicle manufacturing, it is not enough and incentives are needed for investments in carbon capture, use and storage and green hydrogen, both of which have yet to be deployed commercially at scale.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Airline passengers want visible plastic barriers in the cabin to reinstill confidence in flying during the pandemic, saying they do not all trust industry assurances about high air quality onboard, aviation industry executives said on Thursday.
Other pandemic-related trends could include more private business class seating on narrowbody planes, adding touchless lavatory features and permanent conversions of passenger planes to freighters, according to a panel at the MRO Asia-Pacific conference held online.
Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) is studying reusable and disposable plastic barriers for its regional jets, but challenges include making sure they are lightweight, not flammable and do not affect aircraft cleaning and evacuation, said Lais Port Antunes, a business development manager in the planemaker's Asia-Pacific division.
""Modern aircraft are already equipped with excellent technology to filter the air,"" she said. ""The passengers should feel safe in an aircraft cabin, but they need to see actions.""
Tan Hean Seng, a senior executive at Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd (SI:STEG), said airline customers, fearing cost increases, did not seem interested putting fewer seats in economy class. But, he added, the airline still needed to reassure them about risk.
""Having a shield between the seats, the passengers may feel safer, especially during mealtimes when passengers take off masks and there is potential contamination,"" Tan said, adding his company had developed a prototype.
In business class, airlines are already expressing more interest in lie-flat seating options as they look to use narrowbody planes on longer routes,  Boeing Co  (N:BA) Vice President of Specialty Products and Services Kate Schaefer said.

""There is an awful lot of interest in those premium passengers in having a pod-type solution,"" she said. ""There is going to be a lot of interest in pods, doors and staggered seating.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Some Bank of Japan board members warned a resurgence in the coronavirus pandemic could delay an economic recovery and destabilise its banking system by pushing more companies under, minutes from the bank's July rate review showed on Thursday.
While they agreed on the need to ramp up stimulus if needed, the BOJ policymakers said the hit to financial institutions' profits from the pandemic could erode their ability to boost lend, the minutes showed.
""Infection numbers are increasing at a faster pace globally, so we need to be on alert of the possibility of a re-insurgence including in Japan,"" a few members were quoted as saying.
""If infection numbers rise again, the timing of an economic recovery will be delayed,"" one of them said. The damage from the pandemic, if prolonged, could lead to job losses, hurt household income and cool consumption, another said.
While the BOJ kept policy steady at the July rate review, the remarks underscore a lack of confidence the board members had over their projections of a modest economic recovery.
""Members agreed if financial institutions' profits remain under pressure for a prolonged period, that could undermine financial intermediation,"" the minutes showed.
Under a policy dubbed yield curve control, the BOJ guides short-term interest rates at -0.1% and 10-year bond yields around zero to achieve its elusive 2% inflation target.
It eased policy twice so far this year to cushion the blow from COVID-19 such as by expanding asset buying and creating a lending facility aimed at easing corporate funding strains.
A few members said the BOJ should continue to focus on easing funding strains, and shift its attention toward efforts to hit its price goal only when the pandemic is contained, the minutes showed.

But others called for more creativity. ""We need to look more deeply into what monetary policy should look like in a world where society must co-exist with the pandemic,"" one member said.

Consumption has started to catch up to the much stronger rebound in industrial output, with retail sales growing in August for the first time this year. Spending on luxury goods, cars and electronics is leading the charge, rising faster than food, clothing and other essentials.
While the supply side of China’s economy has shown resilience, a strong and broad rebound in spending is needed for a more meaningful economic recovery. Even though the virus is under control, income and job losses due to the pandemic have made poorer Chinese unwilling or unable to increase spending, keeping a lid on the rebound.
“Higher-income households have probably built up savings, because of the forced reduction in consumption during lockdown, and could now be ready for a spending spree. It is lower-income households that face a longer slog of normalizing their finances,” He Wei, an analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, said in a recent report.
Luxury Boom
Luxury spending in China will grow 20%-30% this year, according to a report from Boston Consulting Group, but much of that growth is going to come from consumers in the 50 largest and richest cities. People in the other 2,206 cities bought only a quarter of all luxury goods in April-July this year, and their spending was down 4% compared with 2019, according to the report.

The lopsided recovery can also be seen in the car market. Sales of luxury vehicles have recovered much quicker than regular cars, and are now almost a fifth of all cars sold.
One luxury where spending hasn’t rebounded is gambling in Macau, which is forecast to see an 81% drop in revenue this year, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts led by Kenneth Fong. Gaming in the city is traditionally a good indicator of discretionary spending in China, but that came to a crashing halt in February.

Travel is another sector where there’s still a long way to go to recover from the damage caused by the pandemic. Real-time data from China’s 11-biggest cities shows that people are still somewhat wary about going out via public transport.
The week-long national holidays from Oct. 1 will give an indication of whether consumers are becoming more willing and able to spend on discretionary items such tourism.
State television reported that bookings were rising, but they’re unlikely to reach the levels seen in October 2018 or 2019, when more than 1.5 billion trips were made.

Implemented by the World Bank and the European Union's lending arm, the European Investment Bank, the City Climate Finance Gap Fund aims to unlock at least 4 billion euros ($4.66 billion) for low-carbon and climate-resilient projects.
Cities already account for 70% of global CO2 emissions, but with 2.5 billion more people expected to move to them by 2050, and Africa alone expected to see a 700% increase in urban land cover by 2030, limiting the climate impact will be vital.
""In our experience a lot of potentially transformative projects are abandoned along the way because local authorities are not able to take them from the idea stage,"" said the head of the EIB's urban development division, Gerry Muscat.
The new fund, which is an initiative of the governments of Germany and Luxembourg as well as a number of global city, local government and mayor alliances, aims to prevent those kind of problems by getting involved with projects early on.
Developing economies from Afghanistan to Zambia will all be eligible and the fund will support projects ranging from urban transport and energy efficiency to ecosystem restoration and improving slums or local food systems.
The United Nations Climate Action summit last year estimated that $93 trillion needs to be spent on sustainable infrastructure over the next 15 years to achieve the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s special report in 2018, which said global emissions would need to reach net-zero by around 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, said annual investment in low-carbon energy and energy efficiency would need to increase by a factor of five by that point.

(Reuters) - The U.S. economy could face more foreclosures and business bankruptcies in the fall and winter if there is a rise in infections and no additional fiscal aid, conditions that could make it harder for consumers and businesses to access credit, Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren said on Wednesday. 
Community and regional banks could especially come under stress if there is a rise in delinquencies in commercial real estate loans as businesses struggle to stay in operation, Rosengren said.
""I think the challenge is that we are very likely to face a credit crunch kind of issue as we get towards the end of this year,"" Rosengren said in an interview with Reuters.
The policymaker said his outlook is more pessimistic than the median projection shared by other members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which calls for the unemployment rate to drop to 7.6% this year and for the economy to contract by 3.7% in 2020. 
A rise in infections could lead to a sharper decline in economic activity if some parts of the country roll out fresh lockdowns or if consumers opt to stay home out of fear, Rosengren said. Slower growth could also lead inflation to rise more slowly than anticipated, requiring the Fed to keep rates near zero for longer, Rosengren said.
With the pandemic lasting longer than expected, more fiscal aid is needed to keep businesses and households afloat, he said. Some businesses that borrowed in the corporate bond market before the crisis may now face issues paying off that debt, he said.

""It would have been fine if the pandemic lasted three months, but the pandemic isn’t lasting three months,"" Rosengren said. ""It's lasting much longer than that and so there's definitely a need for more targeted spending.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed new curbs on imports of Cuban rum and cigars and banned Americans from staying at properties owned by the Cuban government, as he sought to lock in the Cuban-American vote in the swing state of Florida ahead of November's presidential election.
The moves were the latest in Trump's effort, since taking office in January 2017, to roll back a detente with America's old Cold War foe pursued by his Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama.
Trump's aides believe his toughened stance on Cuba has gone down well in the large Cuban-American community in south Florida, an important voting bloc in a state where he and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden are locked in a tight race.
""Today, as part of our continuing fight against communist oppression, I am announcing that the Treasury Department will prohibit U.S. travelers from staying at properties owned by the Cuban government,"" Trump said at a White House event.
""We're also further restricting the importation of alcohol and Cuban tobacco,"" the Republican president said at the ceremony honoring Bay of Pigs veterans.
Trump's decision deals a blow to Obama's policy of allowing American travelers to bring back as much of Cuba's legendary rum and cigars that they could carry in their baggage for personal use.
However, it was unclear from the Treasury statement whether the new restrictions would prohibit Americans from bringing back any amount of rum and cigars or would just impose new limits.
“The current U.S. authorities insist on the application of a sanctions policy against Cuba that has not achieved the proposed objectives in 60 years,"" said a Cuban embassy official in Washington. ""It is a wrong policy that is widely rejected by American society and even among Cuban Americans.”
The measures - which bar Americans from staying at hundreds of government-owned hotels and also include new restrictions on professional meetings, performances and sports competition - are intended to deny revenue to Cuban authorities, but are not expected to have any immediate impact.
The island is closed off to foreign travelers due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Carrie Filipetti, deputy assistant secretary of state for Cuba and Venezuela, said the new policy ""will continue even past the pandemic.""
Wednesday's move comes as Trump and Biden are competing fiercely in Florida, which Trump won in 2016 by just 1.2 percentage points. Trump will hold a rally in Jacksonville on Thursday.
Filipetti denied the measures were timed for electoral gain, saying they had been in the works for some time. 
""There is no nexus to any domestic issue,"" she said.
In June 2019, the Trump administration imposed heavy new restrictions on travel to Cuba, saying the move aimed to further pressure the Communist government over its support for Venezuela’s embattled President Nicolas Maduro.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration ordered Marriott International (O:MAR) to wind down hotel operations in Communist-run Cuba. Starwood Hotels, now owned by Marriott, was the first U.S. hotel company to sign a deal with Cuba since the 1959 revolution amid normalization of relations sought by Obama.

“I am going to keep talking about this because I think this is important,” Bostic said in a virtual speech to the Hale County, Alabama, Chamber of Commerce. “I am hopeful that policy makers in Washington as well as at the state level find creative ways to get that support out there.”
Bostic’s comments echoed Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who told Congress today that there was a need for additional fiscal aid with some of the $3 trillion in support programs expired while the economy has been coming back from the biggest downturn since the 1930s.
“Right now this is the issue,” Bostic said. “With relief running out there is a pretty significant chance that some of the temporary disruption and dislocation can become permanent. That just means the hurdle that we have to climb is going to be that much higher.”
The Atlanta Fed president said that low-income workers and poorer communities have been hurt disproportionately by the crisis, which has eliminated many lower-paying service jobs at restaurants, hotels and tourism attractions. Orlando and New Orleans are two cities in the Atlanta Fed district particularly hard hit, and will take longer to recover than other areas, he said.
The pandemic “accelerated and exacerbated” inequality, he said.
The course of the virus outbreak will help determine the economy’s trajectory, Bostic said, adding he was worried by rising infections in Alabama.

183,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>",Fed Officials Warn of Economic Risks in New Plea for Fiscal Help,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve policy makers on Wednesday highlighted the importance of fiscal stimulus for an economic recovery that recently has outperformed forecasts.
Chairman Jerome Powell continued to wave the fiscal flag carefully at a congressional hearing -- amid a political stalemate over a new package -- saying that more support was likely to be necessary. Others were more full-throated, with Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester saying it was very much needed given the “deep hole” the economy is climbing out of.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans expressed concern the stimulus he penciled in won’t be forthcoming, while Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren suggested it’ll take another wave of infections to prompt action, and likely not until next year.
Declines in the stock market, until recently attributed to a reversal of excessive tech-share gains, have increasingly been attributed in part to worries about the recovery and the need for more stimulus. The S&P 500 Index was down 1.7% as of 2:22 p.m. in New York, the fifth drop in six days.
“The most difficult part of the recovery is still ahead of us,” Rosengren said in remarks Wednesday, saying he was more pessimistic than his colleagues over how many Americans will return to work over the next 15 months.
Financial Impact
The Boston Fed chief raised particular concern over “disturbing” signs in commercial real estate. The sector saw risky behavior before the pandemic and is now being hit by the coronavirus’s impact on everything from hotels to strip malls, he said.
“A structural shock, like the pandemic, can result in a significant increase in the number of nonperforming loans, eventually impinging the ability of banks and insurance companies to continue to make credit available to borrowers,” Rosengren said.
Like Powell, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, in an interview on Bloomberg Television, emphasized the recovery has so far been stronger than officials predicted a few months ago. He also made clear the road ahead will be difficult and repeated the theme that fiscal support would help.
‘Deep Hole’
“The economy is recovering robustly, but we are still in a deep hole,” he said. “Long term, the U.S. needs to get back on a sustainable fiscal path, but you don’t want to start that in the midst of the worst economic hit in 90 years.”
In new economic forecasts released Sept. 16, Fed officials had a median projection for unemployment at 7.6% next quarter, down from the 8.4% recorded in August, with a further drop to 5.5% at the end of 2021.
Rosengren said his own projections were “less optimistic.” Evans noted that his own forecast incorporated an expectation of $1 trillion of further fiscal support.
Democrats and Republicans have been at loggerheads over another fiscal stimulus package, with no formal negotiations since early August.

Quarles, who is also the Fed's vice president of supervision, was among the 8-2 majority at the U.S. central bank that last week voted to promise to keep interest rates low until the economy reaches full employment, and inflation has risen to 2% and is on track to moderately exceed that target for some time.

""By providing additional monetary policy accommodation through stronger, outcomes-based forward guidance, the (Fed) hopes to quicken the pace of the recovery.""
Quarles said he sees strong momentum in U.S. consumer spending, but job growth will likely slow and business spending is still uncertain. He noted that indicators of future inflation do not point to a rapid rise.

187,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 12:16PM ET</span>","Fed's Evans says he doesn't fear 2.5% inflation, or even above","(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will keep interest rates at zero until the economy reaches full employment, inflation is ""sustainably"" at 2% and the Fed is confident it will overshoot that goal, Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans said Wednesday.
""I do not fear stronger accommodation in the pursuit of clearly overshooting 2%, even to the point of 2-1/2, or even a little bit more,"" Evans said at a virtual event hosted by MNI, adding that Fed forecasts suggest no rate hikes through at least 2023. Once the Fed does start raising rates, policy will remain accommodative, helping to boost inflation further.
Inflation of 2.5% for some time ""is in the cards,"" if the Fed is doing its job right, he said, adding that while the Fed does not need to buy more bonds now, it will do so if easier policy becomes needed. 
For now, he said, the key to faster recovery isn't further bond buying from the Fed but rather controlling the pandemic better and delivering further fiscal support, particularly to people without jobs and to local governments cutting jobs because they've lost tax revenue due to the crisis and recession. 
Without fiscal support, unemployment won't fall as fast, he said.
But once the recovery is further underway, the Fed will ""pivot"" to policy easing to make sure inflation will rise to, and beyond, the 2% target, he said.

The policymaker said his economic outlook is more pessimistic than those of his peers at the Fed because he expects a resurgence of the virus to dampen consumer spending and strain the commercial real estate market. 
""Recent economic data have been encouraging, but I believe the most difficult part of the recovery is still ahead of us,"" Rosengren said in remarks prepared for a virtual forum organized by the Boston Economic Club. 
Rosengren said monetary policy and fiscal policy will need to remain ""highly accommodative"" until a vaccine is widely available, which is likely required before businesses and consumers will return to previous spending levels. 
Some businesses may choose not to renew their leases, which could lead to an increase in mortgage delinquencies and affect small and medium-sized banks, he said. Fiscal programs that send money to impacted businesses without requiring them to take on more debt can help ease the pain, Rosengren said. 
The Fed official said he is also concerned that the labor market could recover more slowly going forward because some workers will need to retrain for new jobs in different industries, a process that can take time. 
""Potential financial impediments and challenges in the labor market make the recovery process more gradual than any of us would prefer,"" Rosengren said. 

Rosengren said he hopes guidance recently issued by the Fed clarifying how lenders and regulators should treat loans issued through the Main Street lending program will encourage more banks to participate. The nation's largest banks are currently not active in the program, he said.

Sunak is due to set out the future of the job support programme in a statement to parliament on Thursday.

Less than six weeks before the Nov. 3 election, top Democrats in the House of Representatives said they expect to consider the ""Protecting Our Democracy Act"" next year, when they hope to have Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in the White House and a Democratic majority controlling the Senate.
""I think these reforms will have bipartisan support next year,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told a news conference, saying that the current Republican-controlled Senate led by Senator Mitch McConnell would not be expected to consider such a measure.
The legislation surfaced after nearly four years of a Trump presidency that Democrats claim has eroded the U.S. democratic system of checks and balances by placing his personal and political interests above the national interest, with help from Senate Republicans. 
""(The Founders) probably could not envision a president who would kick over the guardrails and that the Senate of the United States would be complicit,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. 
House Democrats impeached Trump in 2019, only to see him acquitted by Senate Republicans early this year. Republicans contend that Democrats have sought to undermine Trump since before he entered office in 2017. 
The new measure would suspend the statute of limitations for federal crimes committed by a sitting president or vice president, codify the U.S. Constitution's emoluments clause, tighten oversight of pardons, strengthen congressional subpoena powers and enhance protections for whistleblowers and inspectors general.

It would also require political committees to report foreign contacts and expands the federal prohibition against foreign campaign contributions to include information sought or obtained for political advantage.

The furloughs will impact city employees in managerial positions and non-union employees, he said. 
Last week, de Blasio announced that everyone in the mayor's office, including the mayor himself, will be furloughed for one week without pay beginning Oct. 1. 
The coronavirus outbreak had caused the city to lose $9 billion in revenue and forced a $7 billion cut to the city's annual budget, de Blasio said.

194,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Fed’s Clarida Says Months of 2% Inflation Needed for Liftoff,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said the central bank won’t consider raising interest rates from near zero until it actually achieves 2% inflation for at least a few months as well as full employment.
“We’re not going to even begin to think about lifting off, we expect, until we actually get observed inflation -- and we measure it on a year-over-year basis, equal to 2%,” Clarida said Wednesday in a Bloomberg Television interview with Tom Keene, Lisa Abramowicz and Jonathan Ferro (NYSE:FOE). “That’s at least -- we could actually keep rates at this level even beyond that.”
The Federal Open Market Committee last week signaled rates would stay near zero through 2023 and adapted their post-meeting statement to reflect their new strategy -- of allowing inflation to rise above 2% after periods of under-performance. The guidance has generated some diverse takes from various Fed officials and economists, with Chicago Fed leader Charles Evans this week raising the possibility of raising rates prior to reaching 2% on average.
“We don’t want it to be a fleeting, you know, one quarter and done,” Clarida said. “At that point we will assess what is the appropriate liftoff and timing, but that’s really down the road.”
The vice chairman said that liftoff is several years off, as the economy is recovering from the deepest recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s. He repeated the Fed’s call for additional fiscal support to help speed the recovery.
“The economy is recovering robustly, but we are still in a deep hole,” he said. “Long term, the U.S. needs to get back on a sustainable fiscal path, but you don’t want to start that in the midsts of the worst economic hit in 90 years.”

195,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>","Fed not thinking about rate hike until inflation 'at least' 2%, Clarida says","By Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Wednesday that policymakers ""are not even going to begin thinking"" about raising interest rates until inflation hits 2%, comments aimed at cementing the public's understanding of the U.S. central bank's new approach to monetary policy. 
""Rates will be at the current level, which is basically zero, until actual observed PCE inflation has reached 2%,"" Clarida told Bloomberg Television, referring to the Fed's preferred measure of prices. PCE inflation tends to be somewhat lower than the better-known Consumer Price Index.
""That’s 'at least.' We could actually keep rates at this level beyond that. But we are not even going to begin thinking about lifting off, we expect, until we actually get observed inflation ... equal to 2%. Also we want our labor market indicators to be consistent with maximum employment ... So that is the whites of their eyes.”
The Fed cut rates to near zero in March and took other steps to combat a recession that took hold as businesses shut down and consumers stayed home to fight the spread of the coronavirus. 
Clarida said that with further government aid from Congress and the steps the Fed has already taken, the U.S. economy could return from the current ""deep hole"" of joblessness and weak demand in perhaps three years.
To aid that process, the Fed in late August revised its approach to monetary policy to commit to lower rates for longer periods of time, allowing the risk of higher inflation to try to encourage a stronger economic recovery and more job gains for workers. A follow-up policy statement last week gave more specific guidance about future decisions, but questions remain about what the new approach will mean in practice.
Clarida said there should not be any confusion: Rates will not increase until labor markets recover fully and prices hit the Fed's target.
""So lower for longer, and we have given some observable metrics,"" for judging when a rate hike debate might begin, Clarida said.

Decisions about any possible overshoot of inflation are ""academic"" at this point, he said, and can be made once the economy rebounds.

LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is determined to get a Brexit trade deal with Britain but will be firm and realistic with London after Prime Minister Boris Johnson decided to break the divorce agreement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Wednesday.
The United Kingdom left the EU in January but remains a member in all but name until the end of the year, by which time it hopes to have clinched a free trade deal with the bloc.
Talks have snagged on fishing, state aid rules and how trade will flow to Northern Ireland, which will remain - under the 2020 divorce treaty - in closer orbit to the EU than will the rest of the United Kingdom. 
After Johnson introduced a bill that would override parts of the 2020 accord, the EU demanded that he step back from the brink though parliament on Tuesday backed giving Johnson the powers to undercut it.
The bloc could take legal action over the proposed breach of international law, though this could take years to resolve, and in the meantime EU diplomats say Brussels wants negotiations on its future relationship with Britain to continue. 
On arrival in London before informal talks with Britain, Barnier told Reuters when asked if he was optimistic about reaching a deal: ""I am determined.""
""We remain calm, respectful, realistic and firm,"" Barnier said, though he declined to comment on the Internal Market Bill or on the odds of securing a trade deal.
Britain has said it hopes never to need to use proposed powers while the timetabling of the Internal Market Bill in the British parliament means that it will take most of October and November to consider.
That means it will not be law either before an EU end-of-September deadline to withdraw the plan, or Johnson's Oct. 15 deadline for a deal with the EU.
""The timetable for the passage of the bill does provide a welcome space for constructive engagement on the concerns raised by the UK,"" a senior EU diplomat said.
""My understanding is that a decision on possible EU legal action won’t be taken until early October,"" the diplomat said.
CUSTOMS CONTROLS
Failure to reach a deal would create uncertainty over trade in everything from car parts and shellfish to data and Scotch whisky, while spooking financial markets just as Europe's economies grapple with a second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak.
British trucks could face delays of up to two days to enter Europe and queues of around 7,000 lorries after Britain leaves the bloc at the end of this year, disrupting imports and exports of crucial goods, the government has warned.
Michael Gove, the minister overseeing the Brexit talks, told the logistics and freight industry that truck drivers would face new customs controls and processes irrespective of whether a trade deal can be agreed between the two sides.
He said under the government's reasonable worst case scenario, up to 70% of trucks travelling to the EU might not be ready for new border controls.
Britain says it is working hard to reach an agreement, but has stuck to its position that any deal must respect the country's sovereignty.
The EU says because of Britain's proximity to the bloc, London must agree to a so-called level playing field of fair competition guarantees.

Although the EU is holding a summit on Oct. 1-2, just after the deadline expires, the bloc's leaders will not consider next steps on relations with Britain until another summit in mid-October.

The ILO said that global working hour losses so far this year have been “considerably larger” than previously estimated. In the second quarter, working hours were 17% lower compared with the end of 2019, equivalent to almost 500 million jobs. That’s up from 400 million projected in June.
The organization also estimates that labor income losses around the world -- excluding the offset from government support programs -- amounted to $3.5 trillion so far.
While the situation will improve in the second half, the outlook has also worsened considerably since June. The destruction in the fourth quarter will be equivalent to 245 million jobs in a baseline scenario, up from 140 million. Under a pessimistic outcome, the fallout could amount to the equivalent of more than 500 million.
The revisions partly reflect the increase in global infection rates, which means a greater economic impact in the second half than the ILO previously assumed. The Geneva-based organization also said there’s been greater damage to jobs in developing economies, where there’s less opportunity for home working, and on informal work.
Worryingly for the long term, the ILO said the decline in employment has led to an increase in inactivity. That could leave many people cut off from the labor market, slow the job recovery and increase inequality.

202,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 08:20AM ET</span>",Brazil's steep rate curve should pose no threat to government funding,"By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Despite a spike in Brazil's long-term interest rates serving as a ""warning"" to remedy public finances, the central bank's record low official interest rate means there is little risk - if any - to the government's ability to service its ballooning debt.
The steepening of the Brazilian rate curve reflects investors demanding higher premiums to lend longer term to the government due to growing worries over its ability to reduce record pandemic-fueled borrowing.
Treasury Secretary Bruno Funchal told Reuters this week the spike in market-based rates was a ""warning"" and said policymakers have ""no room for error"" to return to fiscal discipline.
That, at least, is the orthodox narrative.
But as the Treasury admits, the slide in the central bank's key Selic interest rate since last year to 2.00% has brought the average cost of funding the federal public debt to its lowest on record.
As the minutes of the central bank's last policy meeting showed on Tuesday, the Selic is unlikely to be raised for a very long time, and could even be reduced further.
As long as the Selic stays 'lower for longer', the Treasury's shift in strategy to increase short-term debt issuance could also help put a cap on borrowing costs. 
""Brazil is facing an unprecedented scenario of very low interest rates for a very long time,"" said Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ""This buys the country a lot of time to adjust the fiscal accounts and adopt a lot of imprudent policies."" 
""We're not in the 1980s anymore,"" she said.
RECORD LOW FUNDING COSTS
The difference between near- and longer-term borrowing costs on many parts of the Brazilian interest rate curve is the widest since the height of the public health and economic crisis earlier this year. Spreads are close to breaching even these historic peaks.
But as the chart below from the Treasury shows, the average cost of servicing the federal debt and new borrowing in July was historically low. With the Selic having been cut further since then, it will likely be even lower. 
The average cost of servicing the overall stock of federal domestic debt in the 12 months to July was 7.4%. At the end of last year, it was 8.7%, and four years ago it was 14%.
Similarly, the average cost of issuing new federal domestic debt in the 12 months through July was 5.1%, compared with almost 7% at the end of last year and over 14% four years ago. 
(Graphic: Brazil's average cost of funding - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwpkkzajpm/TREASURY1.png)
Brazil's government expects to amass a primary budget deficit this year of 866 billion reais ($158 billion), more than 12% of gross domestic product, with some private sector economists pegging the shortfall closer to 1 trillion reais. 
This will swell the accumulated gross debt close to 100% of GDP, from 76% at the end of last year, also a record and significantly higher than most emerging economies. 
This has forced Treasury to raise more funds via short-term issuance, a potentially risky strategy highlighted by some failed floating-rate 'LFT' debt auctions lately. On Friday, investors bought only a fifth of the LFT notes on offer. 
But Treasury officials appear relaxed. Luis Felipe Vital, head of public debt operations, played down the recent weak demand for LFT paper and said shorter-term borrowing is ""super positive"" for the Treasury in terms of cost.
Similarly, the steep curve does not appear to be an issue either.
""Even though premiums have clearly increased recently, the cost to the Treasury remains historically low,"" Vital told Reuters. ""Are higher premiums a cost issue for the Treasury? Not at all. Treasury (funding) costs are the lowest since our series began."" 
The Treasury needs to refinance some 835 billion reais of federal public debt maturing in the next 12 months, and 889 billion reais in calendar 2021, central bank figures show.
These are big numbers. But with interest rates so low, they are manageable.

203,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 08:18AM ET</span>",Sunak Weighs German-Style Program to Replace U.K. Furlough,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is studying proposals for a German-style program of subsidizing workers to stave off a wave of unemployment when his current wage support measures end next month, four people familiar with the matter said.
Sunak’s team has been in talks with business groups and unions on the detail of the plan, which is similar to Germany’s longstanding Kurzarbeit program and would help employees return to their jobs on shorter hours.
Employers would pay them for the hours worked, and the cost of the remaining hours not worked would be split between workers, employers and the government, people familiar with the discussions said.
The Treasury declined to comment on the specific proposals but an official emphasized that Sunak has promised to “act in creative and effective ways” to support jobs. Labor unions want action urgently.
“With the right approach we can stop mass unemployment scarring millions,” said Trades Union Congress General Secretary Frances O’Grady. She called on ministers to “fast-track a new plan.”
The chancellor is facing urgent calls to come up with a blueprint to support jobs and businesses after Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed new restrictions on the British public in an effort to tackle the surge in coronavirus cases. While the government wants to avoid protecting jobs that will never come back, heightened uncertainty now could weigh on the pound and stifle the U.K.’s economic recovery.
The impact of the latest restrictions will likely reverberate across the economy starting from the fourth quarter and into 2021, damaging the rebound. Economists at BofA Global Research now expect economic growth to grind to a halt over the next six months.
Shutting down industries with high-level social contact, including entertainment and the arts, would lead to a 0.8% contraction in the fourth quarter, according to Bloomberg Economics. Blanket lockdown restrictions for two weeks at the start of October, meanwhile, would cause output to shrink 3.9% before expanding 3.7% in the following three months, BE estimates show.
The furlough program is due to end on Oct. 31, and the chancellor is being pushed by opposition parties and businesses to extend it or replace it with a new initiative, amid predictions unemployment could rise to 3 million people. Ministers have promised to announce “targeted” support.
“We will go forward with further creative an imaginative schemes to keep our economy moving,” Johnson said on Wednesday in Parliament when asked about extending support for business.
One of the people familiar with the discussions over the plans said an announcement could come as soon as this month. The Treasury also aims to extend the deadline for company applications for state-backed loans until the end of November, two people with knowledge of the talks said.
As things stand, the last day to apply for an 80% state-backed Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan is Sept. 30. The deadline for larger companies is Oct. 20, and for 100% government-backed bounceback loans, it is Nov. 4.
The people said that an announcement on loan deadlines had been expected this week, but it may be delayed so that the chancellor can announce a wider economic package that includes a furlough successor at a later date.
One option for replacing the furlough program which the U.K. Treasury is looking at comes from the Confederation of British Industry, the country’s biggest business lobby. The CBI is calling on Sunak to introduce a new short-time working program that would support employees returning to work rather than those kept off work.
Employees would work a minimum of 50% of their normal hours, paid for by their company. Payment for the hours they don’t work would be split with the company and government each paying a third of the balance, and the employee forfeiting the remainder.
That’s similar to a proposal from the Trades Union Congress, which helped Sunak draft the initial plan back in March. Under the TUC model, firms would pay employees for the hours they do work, and the Treasury would contribute 70% of their wages for when they don’t, with firms paying another 10%.
Other suggestions include an idea from the Institute for Public Policy Research, to replace the current plan with a Coronavirus Work-Sharing Scheme targeting only jobs and businesses that are likely to be sustainable. The Resolution Foundation has proposed a job-sharing initiative where two people work part-time on the same role, with the state paying for non-worked hours.
Others have suggested extending the current furlough program -- either in full or for the worst-affected industries. Such a move would be relatively inexpensive, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. It says keeping the plan until the middle of 2021 would cost about 10 billion pounds ($13 billion) and pay for itself by reducing long-term unemployment.

204,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 08:18AM ET</span>",Brexit Blame Game Ignites as Truckers Slam U.K. on Chaos Warning,"(Bloomberg) --
The logistics industry slammed a government warning that 7,000 trucks could be backed-up at the U.K. border after Brexit, saying its operators shouldn’t be painted as “villains” when they haven’t been given the means to prepare.
“Don’t start pointing the finger of blame in our direction when you have still to provide all of the tools to do the job,” Robert Keen, director general of the British International Freight Association, said in an email. “Give our members all the information they need, and systems that actually work, and they will be more than able to do what is necessary.”
BIFA’s angry reaction followed a letter from Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove which urged traders to prepare for new border controls when the U.K. leaves the EU’s single market and customs union at the end of the year. The letter said as many as 70% of trucks may not be ready to enter the EU and the flow of freight between Dover and Calais -- a vital trade artery -- could be cut by as much as 80% below normal levels.
“The biggest potential cause of disruption are traders not being ready for controls implemented by EU Member States on 1 January 2021,” Gove wrote in the letter, dated Tuesday and seen by Bloomberg News. “It is essential that traders act now and get ready for new formalities.”
Checks
Preparing for customs checks on trade with the EU is one of the biggest logistical challenges facing Boris Johnson’s government. Failure risks major disruption to commerce with the U.K.’s largest trading partner when the Brexit transition period ends on Dec. 31.
The government’s fear is that trucks will be stopped by EU officials for failing to have the correct post-Brexit paperwork, causing supply chain chaos and adding to the economic pain of coronavirus.
Key to the government’s plan to minimize disruption is a new IT system -- the Smart Freight Service -- which would issue trucks with a permit indicating that they have the right paperwork to enter the EU. Trucks entering Kent without a permit would be fined 300 pounds ($382). However, the government acknowledges the system will still be in testing mode in January, and users risk encountering bugs.
‘Retaliation’
Keen said the government is “getting their retaliation in first.”
“With just over 14 weeks to go before the end of the Brexit transition period, traders and logistics providers are still waiting for so much information and clarity from the government,” he said. They “are shocked by the lack of consistency in government policy, systems planning and procedures.”
Gove’s letter is the first time a government minister has put their name to the predictions of significant upheaval at the U.K.-EU border. Last week, the Guardian newspaper reported on a briefing document from civil servants which warned of long lines and disrupted freight flow and forms the basis of Gove’s intervention.
“I would urge the government to get ready and ensure the systems are in place,” Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow cabinet office minister, told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. “A shock to our economy on top of the pandemic and everything we’re going through now would be an awful thing to inflict upon British businesses and European businesses.”

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German cabinet on Wednesday approved Finance Minister Olaf Scholz's draft budget for next year which envisages net new debt of 96.2 billion euros ($112.6 billion) to finance further measures to tackle the coronavirus crisis.
The additional borrowing marks the second-highest amount of net new debt in Europe's largest economy since the end of World War Two and comes after the government already took on record high borrowing of some 218 billion euros this year.
""We protect the health of citizens, support the economy and secure employment,"" Scholz said, adding that the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over so the government must not let up in its efforts.
""With the 2021 budget, we are making it clear that we will go all the way together. We act decisively, even if it costs a lot of money, because doing nothing would cost our country even more,"" Scholz said.
The budget underlines Scholz's determination to move Germany further away from its former image as Europe's austerity champion and secure Berlin's new role as the biggest spender in the euro zone's struggle to recover from the coronavirus shock.
The fiscal plans require Germany to suspend its constitutionally enshrined debt limits in 2021 after parliament already abandoned them this year.
From 2022 onwards, Germany plans to stick to its debt brake rules again, limiting borrowing to a tiny fraction of gross domestic product.
The government's mid-term fiscal plans envisage net new debt of 10.5 billion euros in 2022, 6.7 billion euros in 2023 and 5.2 billion euros in 2024. This means Germany is not planning to return to its ultra-prudent fiscal policy of keeping a balanced budget.
Germany is benefiting from record low borrowing costs, partly enabled by the European Central Bank's loose monetary policy, so Berlin's bill for debt servicing is likely to shrink further this year despite its additional borrowing plans.
Germany expects its debt-to-GDP ratio to jump to around 75% in 2020 from just below 60% in 2019 and then remain at that level in 2021 as the economy is expected to rebound strongly.
This would by far be the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio among the members of the G7 group of industrialized countries. By comparison, Britain's debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to jump to some 100% this year while Japan's is seen ballooning to roughly 265%.

207,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Explainer: What happens next with UK plan to breach Brexit divorce treaty?,"By William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson is winning his parliamentary battle to pass laws that could allow him to tear up parts of Britain's EU exit treaty, despite a warning from Brussels that doing so would wreck their future relationship.
The Internal Market Bill is aimed at ensuring Britain's four nations can trade freely with one another after leaving the European Union.
But the government says that requires creating powers to override part of the withdrawal treaty it signed with Brussels - a breach of international law it says is necessary to protect Northern Ireland if ongoing talks fail.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
The bill must pass through both houses of the British parliament to become law -- first the House of Commons, where Johnson's Conservative Party has an 80-seat majority, and then the House of Lords, the upper chamber, where it does not have a majority.
The bill has passed its most difficult test in the Commons and will finish its journey through the lower house on Monday or Tuesday next week.
After this it will undergo scrutiny in the House of Lords.
SO IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE LORDS?
Not quite.
The bill is not being fast-tracked and will take most of October and November to consider.
This means it will not be law either before an EU end-of-September deadline to withdraw the plan, or Johnson's Oct. 15 deadline for a deal with the EU.
The negotiations around either of these deadlines, if successful, could remove the need for the bill's most contentious parts.
This puts the immediate focus back on negotiations with Brussels, where the EU has not yet taken a formal decision on what to do next in light of Johnson's refusal to withdraw the bill.
A senior EU diplomat said: ""The timetable for the passage of the bill does provide a welcome space for constructive engagement on the concerns raised by the UK” and so a decision on possible EU legal action will be delayed until early October.
CAN'T THE HOUSE OF LORDS STILL BLOCK THE BILL?
Many members of the upper house have criticised the bill, including Conservatives, but their primary role is to amend and improve legislation, not to block it on principle.
While there is precedent for the Lords blocking legislation, deciding to do so on this bill would provoke a constitutional row, and such a move is currently seen as unlikely.
The House of Lords is more likely to seek to amend the bill to remove or dilute certain parts, or insert additional checks and balances. The amendments would go back to the House of Commons for approval -- probably in early December.
If Johnson's lower-house majority holds firm, the bill could bounce back and forth between the two chambers until either a compromise is found or the government attempts to pass it without House of Lords approval.
WHY DOES BRITAIN WANT TREATY-BUSTING POWERS?
The government says the powers are a safety net to protect peace in Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on how to manage cross-border trade fail.
The EU wants to make sure the open border with Ireland doesn't act as a back door into the bloc for goods. Britain wants to make sure goods flow freely between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
WHAT CONCESSIONS HAS THE GOVERNMENT MADE?
Johnson has so far made two concessions.
Firstly he promised parliament a vote on any decision to use the treaty-breaking powers created by the bill -- a compromise that snuffed out a rebellion within his own party.
Secondly, he has also committed to referring any dispute with the EU to the resolution mechanism set out in the Withdrawal Agreement ""in parallel"" to using the treaty-busting powers unilaterally.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Income earned from work worldwide dropped by an estimated 10.7%, or $3.5 trillion, in the first nine months of 2020, compared to the same period a year ago, the International Labour Organization (ILO) said on Wednesday.
The figure, which does not include income support provided by governments to compensate for workplace closures during the pandemic, is equal to 5.5% of global gross domestic product (GDP) for the first three quarters of 2019, it said.
""Workplace closures continue to disrupt labour markets around the world, leading to working hour losses that are higher than previously estimated,"" the ILO said in its sixth report on the effects of the pandemic on the world of work. 
Workers in developing and emerging economies, especially those in informal employment, had been affected to a much greater extent than in past crises, the United Nations agency said. It added that a decline in employment numbers had generally been greater for women than men.
""Just as we need to redouble our efforts to beat the virus, so we need to act urgently and at scale to overcome its economic, social and employment impacts. That includes sustaining support for jobs, businesses and incomes,"" ILO Director-General Guy Ryder said in a statement.
  In the second quarter alone, the revised estimate of global working time lost was 17.3%, equivalent to 495 million full-time jobs, against a previous estimate of 14% or 400 million jobs, the report said.
In the third quarter, working-hour losses of 12.1% or equivalent to 345 million jobs were expected, it said.
""Moreover, revised projections for the fourth quarter suggest a bleaker outlook than previously estimated,"" it said.

Working hours losses in the final quarter of 2020 are now projected to amount to 8.6%, equivalent to 245 million full-time jobs, against the same time a year ago, the ILO said.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 06:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive: How COVID-19 stimulus money will end up in U.S. tobacco farmers' pockets,"By P.J. Huffstutter and Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. government aid payments to tobacco farmers will be channeled through a new account within the office of the agriculture secretary, an unusual move that bypasses the normal mechanism for distributing farm aid and stokes concerns about how the government is using COVID-19 stimulus.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Friday said it will pay up to $100 million to tobacco farmers from Congress' coronavirus economic stimulus package, as part of a $14 billion assistance program for farmers hurt by the pandemic.
The payments would benefit farmers in North Carolina, a swing state in the Nov. 3 presidential election and the country's top tobacco producer. President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden are locked in a dead heat among likely voters in North Carolina, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday.
The existence of the new USDA account has not been previously reported. In response to questions from Reuters this week, USDA said there was nothing wrong with the new account - which it originally set up this spring - and said it has taken steps to track the flow of funds.
The agency opened the new account because of how Congress apportioned money from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed in March and to simplify the process of paying farmers, a USDA representative said.
Lawmakers typically apportion emergency funds to an agency and existing accounts set up at the division that would handle a program, according to agricultural and government analysts.
Groups including the American Lung Association and Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids were dismayed that aid meant for Americans struggling with fallout from a deadly lung disease was earmarked for tobacco. 
Most U.S. crop subsidies are paid via the 1930s-era Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), which gives USDA broad authority to make direct payments to growers when crop prices are low. 
However, a 2004 law known as the tobacco buyout blocked tobacco growers from receiving CCC funds. The USDA says the tobacco money will not come from CCC.
Instead, the agency said in response to questions from Reuters that the $2.3 trillion CARES Act gave it the authority - and a different pool of taxpayer dollars - to issue the tobacco aid.
In a statement to Reuters, USDA said that if Congress wanted to block tobacco farmers from this money, it would have specifically excluded them in the law.
TRANSPARENCY CONCERNS 
Some economic and legal experts said the 2004 law eliminated the government's role in funding tobacco price supports and worry the Trump administration is not being transparent. 
""The reality is that Congress would have to explicitly authorize paying tobacco farmers,"" said Jonathan Coppess, director of the Gardner Agriculture Policy Program at the University of Illinois, and a former Obama administration official.
Tobacco was not included in the first round of coronavirus aid for farmers announced in April. Lawmakers subsequently spoke with USDA about crops left out of the $19 billion program, such as cherries, olives and raisins, according to USDA, and legislative and industry sources. 
Lawmakers and staff from tobacco-producing states including North Carolina and Kentucky provided feedback, legislative sources said.
The Tobacco Growers Association of North Carolina, North Carolina Farm Bureau and Kentucky Farm Bureau in July sent the USDA estimates of farmers' losses as the pandemic shut off export opportunities, largely to China, said Graham (NYSE:GHM) Boyd, executive vice president of the Tobacco Growers Association of North Carolina. 
He said North Carolina tobacco farmers lost about $200 million in sales potential to China. Farmers had expected exports to improve on the back of a trade agreement Washington and Beijing struck in January. 
""Because of coronavirus we had no ability to meet and negotiate and transact and do business with the Chinese,"" Boyd said. 
""It is a legal, legitimate commodity and to not include it is discrimination, plain and simple."" 
Some tobacco farmers filed for bankruptcy because of the pandemic, said Shawn Harding, president of the North Carolina Farm Bureau. He did not have estimates of lost jobs. 
U.S. Senator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, thanked Trump and U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue for helping tobacco farmers. Tillis trails his Democratic challenger, former state Senator Cal Cunningham, according to an Emerson (NYSE:EMR) College poll released on Monday.
NEW ACCOUNT
As part of the coronavirus stimulus in March, lawmakers approved $9.5 billion in CARES Act funding for agriculture. The CARES Act provided financial relief to people and businesses facing economic hardships due to COVID-19, including farmers.
USDA had access to an estimated $6.5 billion in available CCC funds in the spring. Congress also said USDA could draw an additional $14 billion in CCC funds in July to help farmers cope with COVID-19 - essentially tapping in to money USDA normally could not obtain until fall, according to farm economists.
Lawmakers specifically assigned the non-CCC money to the USDA Office of the Secretary run by Perdue.
USDA said it also moved the $6.5 billion from CCC into the account, and is doing so with the new CCC funding. The agency said it has internal accounting measures in place to ensure CCC funds do not go to tobacco farmers.
Health advocates said the money should instead go toward efforts to prevent smoking, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says may increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19.

""It is particularly troubling that in the midst of this pandemic ... the federal government would do more to promote tobacco as opposed to helping smokers quit,"" said Erika Sward, national assistant vice president of advocacy for the American Lung Association.

Investing.com --  The dollar hits a two-month high as the global economy stutters; Jerome Powell's back in Congress for another day, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s battery ballyhoo falls flat, but  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) surges on blowout quarter, and oil inventory data are due from the U.S. government. Here's what you need to know in markets on Wednesday, September 23rd.
1. Dollar hits two-month high 
The dollar hit a two-month high against its developed-market peers, as the strength ebbed away from cyclical currencies against a backdrop of weakening global economic momentum and signs of sustained tension between the U.S. and China. 
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six currencies, rose above 94.20 at one point before retracing slightly to be at 94.03 at 6:35 AM ET (1035 GMT). The Chinese yuan also weakened after the People’s Bank of China set the daily dollar fixing lower than expected for a second straight day, in what was interpreted as a signal that it is starting to be concerned by the yuan’s rapid appreciation.
The dollar may react later to the second day of Congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Powell had moved forex markets less on Tuesday than his colleague Charles Evans, after the Chicago Fed President argued that the Fed may still raise interest rates before the consumer price index reaches 2%.
2. Europe's Recovery Stalls
The dollar is also benefiting from a bout of euro weakness. IHSMarkit’s ‘flash’ purchasing managers index for the euro zone fell to 50.1 in September, barely above the line that represents growth, as a surge in Covid-19 cases hit customer-facing services particularly hard. Manufacturing fared better, particularly in Germany.
The numbers come amid growing signs that the European Central Bank’s top management is starting to agitate for more stimulus. Board member Fabio Panetta argued on Tuesday that it would be better to do too much than too little, while the Financial Times reported on Monday that the ECB will look at giving all of its asset purchase programs the same flexibility as its 1.35 trillion euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, effectively putting a stronger safety net under the euro zone’s weaker members.
By 6:30, the euro was at $1.1709, having earlier traded as low as $1.1673, its lowest since late July.
The EUR/USD pair may react later to the July house price index, and to a speech by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, both due at 9 AM ET.
3. Stocks set to extend recovery, supported by Nike   
U.S. stocks are set to open higher, building on Tuesday’s tech-led gains after signs that a dispute over the vacant Supreme Court seat won’t entirely derail Washington’s other business.
The House of Representatives passed a bill on Tuesday that will keep the government funded through December 11, after the majority Democrats agreed a short-term fix to keep aid flowing to farmers and poor families.
By 6:35 AM, the Dow Jones Futures contract was up 198 points, or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 0.8% and NASDAQ Futures were up 0.3%.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Nike, which has soared 13.3% in premarket trading after posting earnings more than twice analyst estimates for its latest quarter.  The numbers also lifted rival Adidas’ stock in Europe.
4. Tesla's Flat Battery Day
Another stock in the spotlight will be Tesla, whose much-hyped ‘Battery Day’ event fell flat, pushing the stock down another 4.8% in premarket after a loss of 5.6% on Tuesday.
Founder and CEO Elon Musk outlined plans for a $25,000 electric car powered by much cheaper batteries, that could hit the market by 2023. That would establish Tesla more firmly in the mass-market segment, and Musk said he was aiming at selling 20 million vehicles a year – around twice what Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), the world’s biggest auto group, currently sells.
However, the long lead-time for the project disappointed many, suggesting that Tesla’s lead over rivals in the key battery space is no longer as big as it once was.
5. Oil struggles with inventory data
Crude oil prices struggled again with the $40 a barrel level, after inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a 691,000 rise in U.S. crude stockpiles last week, rather than the draw of 4 million barrels expected.
The government will publish its own data as usual at 10:30 AM ET.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 0.4% at $39.94 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent futures contract was up 0.5% at $41.91.
Commodity prices more broadly have labored as the dollar has snapped back this week. Gold futures have slipped back below $1,900 for the first time in over two months, and traded down 0.6% at $1,895.65 an ounce."
212,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",Factbox: How Russia has prepared itself to blunt threat of more sanctions,"By Alexander Marrow
(Reuters) - The poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and Moscow's involvement in political turmoil in neighbouring Belarus have put additional Western sanctions against Russia back on the agenda ahead of the U.S. presidential election.
But even if imposed, the impact of any new sanctions would likely be muted in comparison with previous efforts to punish Russia over its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and other ""malign activities"" that Moscow denies.
Below are some ways Russia has prepared to cope with the threat of more sanctions since the first wave in 2014. 
FLOATING ROUBLE, AMPLE RESERVES
Russia has the world's fourth-largest gold and foreign currency reserves at $591.8 billion as of Sept. 11, versus $509.6 billion in early 2014 and less than $360 billion in April 2015, its lowest point in the past decade . 
The central bank's move to let the rouble float freely in 2014 made the currency a safety valve against external shocks.
FISCAL RULE
To shield itself from volatility in prices for oil, its main export, Russia adopted the latest version of its fiscal rule in 2017. It envisages that any revenue from crude prices above $42.40 per barrel goes into state coffers. When oil prices are below that level, Russia sells foreign currency, supporting the rouble.
The World Bank has praised the fiscal rule, something that has helped Russia retain investment ratings when oil prices nosedived during the novel coronavirus pandemic.
The rule was temporarily softened to increase state spending and soothe the economic fallout from the virus. 
FX EXPOSURE
Russia significantly reduced its dependency on external markets, slashing foreign debt exposure and boosting domestic borrowing, in an effort to shield itself from external shocks. 
Outstanding foreign debt shrank by about 30% over the past six years to $477 billion as of mid-2020, down from $729 billion in early 2014.
Russia has also diversified its savings, cutting the proportion of its reserves in U.S. dollars to 24.5% as of end-2019 from 45.4% as of end-2013. It added the Chinese yuan to reserves in 2015, taking its share to 12.3% by end-2019. Meanwhile, the amount of gold in Russia's coffers rose to $144.6 billion in September from $40 billion in early 2014.
DOMESTIC SOLUTIONS
Russia created its own card payment system, MIR, in 2014, fearing it could be cut off from global systems Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard. 
Moscow also launched its own financial transactions clearing house, anticipating risks that Euroclear and Clearstream might suspend dealings with Russia, and developed its own banking messaging system as an alternative to global financial network SWIFT.
Russia has set up a national credit rating agency, ACRA, to lower its dependence on global agencies.
REDUCED IMPORT RELIANCE
Russia has become more self-sufficient in food since it banned most Western food imports in 2014 in retaliation against Western sanctions.

This ban and a weaker rouble have helped domestic food producers flourish, reducing Russia's food imports by one third since 2013.

Michael Gove, the minister overseeing the Brexit talks, told the logistics and freight industry that truck drivers would face new customs controls and processes irrespective of whether a trade deal can be agreed between the two sides.
He said under the government's reasonable worst case scenario, up to 70% of trucks travelling to the EU might not be ready for new border controls.
""This could lead to maximum queues of around 7,000 port bound trucks in Kent (in England) and associated maximum delays of up to two days,"" he said.
Britain formally left the bloc in January but remains in a status quo transition period that will expire at the end of this year. The government assumes EU member states will impose third country controls on Britain at the end of the transition period.
""Irrespective of the outcome of negotiations between the UK and EU, traders will face new customs controls and processes,"" he said. ""Simply put, if traders, both in the UK and EU, have not completed the right paperwork, their goods will be stopped when entering the EU and disruption will occur.""
Dover, in the southeast of England, has been Britain's most important gateway to Europe since Roman times and the port now handles 17 percent of the United Kingdom's goods trade. Up to 10,000 trucks a day pass through with everything from perishable food to medicines.
A government spokesman said this was not a forecast or prediction of what will happen but rather a ""stretching scenario"".

It is also launching a Smart Freight IT service that will enable drivers and hauliers to complete a border readiness check, and only allow compliant vehicles to enter the port area.

LAGOS(Reuters) - Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has signed a long-awaited oil-reform bill and it will be formally presented in the Senate as early as next week, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
The legislation has been in the works for the past 20 years, and the main laws governing Nigeria's oil and gas exploration have not been fully updated since the 1960s because of the contentious nature of any change to oil taxes, terms and revenue-sharing within Nigeria. 
But reforms and regulatory certainty became more pressing this year as low oil prices and a shift towards renewable energy made competition for investment from oil majors tougher. 
The alignment of both chambers with Buhari's All Progressives Congress party has also given the reforms the best chance of passage in years.
Buhari officially signed the bill late last week, and his team has already been building support for it in the National Assembly. 
The sources, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the assembly has already chosen teams of members who will work most closely on individual portions of the bill. 
Both the Senate and the House of Representatives must approve it before Buhari can sign it into law.
Two presidential spokesmen declined to comment and the Senate had no immediate comment.
The Ministry of Petroleum Resources sent the draft, the product of months of consultation between Nigerian officials, oil and gas companies and other industry stakeholders, to Buhari last month. 
Excerpts from the bill seen by Reuters included provisions that would streamline and reduce some oil and gas royalties, boost the amount of money companies pay to local communities and for environmental clean-ups and alter the dispute resolution process between companies and the government.
It also included measures to push companies to develop gas discoveries and a framework for gas tariffs and delivery. 

Commercialising gas, particularly for use in local power generation, is a core government priority.

Opposition and business leaders have been calling for the scheme to be extended in some form to avoid a cliff-edge effect they fear could put make millions unemployed, particularly as new COVID-19 restrictions hamper any economic recovery. 
Raab said the programme, officially called the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), would come to an end, but hinted more help could be on the way. 
""I don't think the Chancellor's minded to wholesale extend the furlough scheme, we are looking at the targeted measures,"" Raab told Sky News on Wednesday.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak is said to be considering a wage subsidy similar to the Kurzarbeit system in Germany where government tops up the pay of workers on reduced hours, according to reports in the Financial Times and the Guardian. 
Britain announced new restrictions on pub and restaurant opening times on Tuesday after a surge in COVID-19 cases in September and warned that the measures could last for six months. 
That prompted warnings from the hospitality industry that more jobs could be lost, while other sectors such as airlines and airports have pleaded for sector-specific packages to help retain staff as the economic impact of the pandemic deepens.
Sunak has said he will be ""creative"" in finding ways to minimise any future rise in unemployment. 
Budget forecasters expect the furlough programme to cost around 54 billion pounds ($70 billion) over its eight-month lifespan. At its peak it supported just under 9 million workers and millions continue to rely on it. 

Sunak will keep all measures under review, said Raab, adding that new help for employers through the retention bonus and the kickstart scheme would help avoid a cliff edge.

The total number of companies closing businesses, without going through bankruptcy procedures, may top 53,000 by year-end. That would be the most since relevant data became available in 2000, Tokyo Shoko Research said on Wednesday.
""With the pandemic expected to be prolonged, an increase in companies that discontinue business is unavoidable,"" the think tank said in a report.
The number of companies that discontinued business stood at 35,816 from January through August, up 23.9% from the same period of the previous year, according to the report. That would make up roughly 1% of the 3.58 million firms in Japan.
Of the total, 31% were service-sector firms, followed by construction firms at 18% and retailers at 13%, the report said.
The government and the central bank have deployed various measures since March to ease corporate funding strains, which have helped keep bankruptcy numbers largely unchanged from the previous year's levels, the report showed.
But some companies are struggling to stay alive not because of a cash crunch but diminishing prospects of a pick-up in demand, it said.

Japan suffered its biggest economic slump on record in the second quarter as COVID-19 hit demand. Analysts expect growth to rebound only modestly in the current quarter as the pandemic keeps households and companies from boosting spending.

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Investors in China are betting on a bumpy ride until the end of the U.S. presidential election and seeking to protect their assets from a long chill in Sino-U.S. ties.
Global equity fund managers are shifting out of New York-listed shares in Chinese firms and into Hong Kong-listed vehicles to counter the risk of forced delistings, as both Democrat Joe Biden and Republican President Donald Trump promise a hard line on Beijing. 
And currency investors are fretting that a yuan hovering near 16-month highs is priced for a Biden win, and a calmer tone in diplomacy, which could swiftly unwind if Trump is victorious.
Their bets are focused less on the outcome and more on what most expect to be a rollercoaster period until at least polling day on Nov. 3.
""It doesn't matter if Biden or Trump will be elected. The bipartisan consensus is to be tough on China,"" said Chen Jiabeng, fund manager of Xiamen Portfolio Management Co, which helps investors allocate assets through funds of funds.
""We will not bet on direction. We will bet on higher volatility,"" he said. 
Chen is allocating some 30%-40% of his portfolio to funds with options and futures trading strategies that can profit from wild swings in underlying assets.
A doubling in the volume of stock index option contracts traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in July, surpassing even March's peak at the height of the coronavirus panic, and heavy volumes through August shows Chen is not alone.
Adam Coons, portfolio manager of Indianapolis-based Winthrop Capital Management, plans shifting his stake in  Alibaba  (N:BABA) (HK:9988) from its New York listing to Hong Kong as a ""defensive move"", even though he thinks a U.S. delisting is unlikely. 
Even Hong Kong-listed shares of Tencent (HK:0700) have been hit by a Trump ban on U.S. downloads of its popular WeChat app.
A lack of momentum in Chinese equity markets, which have moved sideways in Shanghai (SSEC) and downwards in Hong Kong (HSI) over recent weeks, belies shifts beneath the surface.
""It's the calm before the storm,"" said Allen Mo, chief investment officer of Ming Yue Asset, a Chinese hedge fund that like Chen's Xiamen is using derivatives to bet on volatility.
The ""smart money"" in China is already pulling out of stocks, he said. 
""TREACHEROUS""
China policy is a major campaign issue, regularly raised by both candidates on the stump and expected to feature in three scheduled televised debates, beginning on Sept. 29.
To be sure, some fund managers think the campaign rhetoric and the election outcome matter little to the long-term trends that form the basis of their investments in China.
""We are fully invested and are seeing green shoots arise in the Chinese economy,"" said Sam Lecornu, chief executive of Stonehorn Global Partners (NYSE:GLP) in Hong Kong.
""We see upside in markets as there's ample liquidity in the system and central banks continue to drive real rates down."" 
Yet some China bulls are holding back for now.
""Clients are very, very concerned about the next 50 days, which I think are very, very treacherous,"" said Davis Hall, head of capital markets in Asia at Indosuez Wealth Management.
""It seems like dollar/CNY is reflecting the probability of a Biden victory,"" he said.

""So what happens if we don't get one? We could immediately give back a lot of this current move,"" he said, advising investors long on yuan to trim their positions for safety.

But ING said in a statement on Wednesday those reports were misleading: what actually happened, the company said, was that the name of a sanctioned entity had accidentally been added to one field of a transaction in 2014. The mention was erroneous, was correcly stripped, and the transaction proceeded.
""This has been discussed with relevant U.S. authorities in 2014 and no further action has been taken,"" ING said.
A series of articles called the “FinCEN Files,” launched onSunday by Buzzfeed News and the International Consortium ofInvestigative Journalists (ICIJ), detailed how several globalbanks moved large sums of allegedly illicit funds for decadesdespite red flags. The series sent bank stocks tumbling onMonday and prompted new calls for legislative reform.
ING shares, down 44% year to date, fell more than 9% on Monday after the reports first surfaced.

Creating an agency to speed up the digitalisation of Japan's outdated government administration has been a key pledge of Suga, who was elected premier last week. 
While the government has made ""digital transformation"" its main policy plank this year, the switch has proved difficult due partly to a vertically structured bureaucracy that hampers efforts to use common platforms for administrative work.
""We need to make an organization with personnel of high ability from public and private sectors, which would lead digitalization in the overall society,"" the Nikkei quoted Suga as saying.
""I want to accelerate discussions to do so, compile basic policy by the end of this year and submit necessary bills to next ordinary session of parliament."" 
Suga has pledged to make sweeping changes to overcome the digital woes, which were blamed for delaying delivery of cash payouts to help citizens weather the impact of the novel coronavirus.
Takuya Hirai, digital transformation minister, said on Friday that Suga had told him to accelerate preparations for setting up new digital agency. And he and government officials met over the weekend to discuss the digital agency. 
""Japan needs to raise its potential growth rate by digitalization,"" said Takuto Murase, senior economist at Japan Research Institute.

223,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 08:36PM ET</span>",House Passes Stopgap Funding Measure to Keep Government Open,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. House passed a stopgap funding bill to keep the government operating through Dec. 11 after both parties in Congress and officials at the White House struck a deal to provide aid to farmers and food assistance for low-income families.
The 359-57 vote on Tuesday night now sends the temporary spending bill to the Senate for a vote before the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. Final passage would avert a government shutdown just before the Nov. 3 general election.
In addition to funding most government agencies, the deal provides $30 billion for the Department of Agriculture’s Commodity Credit Corp. that the Trump administration and farm-state lawmakers had sought.
Democrats got almost $8 billion for a pandemic program to feed children who normally receive school lunches. That’s an increase from the $2 billion Democrats initially suggested they could accept on Friday.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the measure imposes some restrictions limits on use of the CCC money by barring it from going to petroleum refiners or importers, or to help them meet renewable fuel standards.
“We also increase accountability in the Commodity Credit Corporation, preventing funds for farmers from being misused for a Big Oil bailout,” Pelosi said in a statement.
Pelosi and her Democratic colleagues on Monday released a temporary funding plan without the Commodity Credit Corp. or food assistance funding. But facing pressure from some farm-state Democrats and solid opposition from Republicans, Pelosi reopened negotiations.
Democratic critics have accused President Donald Trump of using the CCC to dole out political favors. The president last Thursday announced he was drawing $13 billion in aid from the CCC to help rural areas, which are important to his re-election prospects. He unveiled the move at a campaign event in Wisconsin, a key battleground state in the presidential election.
Democrats from farm states and those in narrowly divided districts pushed Pelosi to include the farm money. Swing district Representative Cindy Axne of Iowa issued a statement calling for inclusion of the CCC funds and warning about a shortfall for traditional farm subsidies.
Virginia Democrat Abigail Spanberger, who also represents a district that Republicans are trying to win back, criticized Pelosi in a tweet over the issue.
“This is a partisan move that slows down much-needed relief for American farmers and agribusinesses. I strongly urge the speaker and House leadership to include an extension of the Commodity Credit Corporation’s borrowing authority in the funding bill,” she tweeted Tuesday.
A continued standoff would have risked the clock running out on government funding if the Senate blocked the House’s version of the stopgap bill and attempted to amend it with the farm-aid funds. Such a Senate vote could also have been politically difficult for Democrats in states where agriculture is a crucial industry.
Democrats had preferred to keep the farm aid debate for a separate stimulus bill and at one point agreed to the change in exchange for $2 billion in food assistance for children. But the final language was still being worked on.
Some Democrats had sought to extend funding into next spring, betting that the Nov. 3 election would put them in charge in the Senate and White House. Republicans resisted that push with the argument that it would give Congress a deadline to finish work on full funding bills.
If the stopgap is finalized, lawmakers will try to complete work on the 12 annual appropriations bills for fiscal 2021 in the post-election lame-duck session in November and December. So far the Senate hasn’t drafted any of the bills, and there’s likely a battle ahead over paying for Trump’s wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and replacing military funds he raided to pay for the wall last year.
Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin agreed earlier this month to keep talks on a coronavirus relief stimulus package separate from the stopgap bill. Stimulus talks have stalled since early August with both sides about $1 trillion apart in their offers.

224,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 07:55PM ET</span>",Brazil government sees $157 billion deficit this year as emergency transfers are extended,"By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's government is on course to post a primary budget deficit of 861 billion reais ($157 billion) this year, the Economy Ministry said in its bimonthly revenue and expenditure report on Tuesday, factoring in extended emergency transfers to the poor through the end of December.
That is wider than the 787.4 billion reais deficit excluding interest payments that was forecast in the last report in July, but slightly below the ministry's official forecast of a 866.4 billion reais shortfall issued earlier this month. 
The ministry and Treasury insist emergency spending and support to cushion the economic shock of the COVID-19 pandemic must be confined to this year, and a concerted effort to reduce its record deficit and debt load will start on Jan. 1.
The report outlined an expected 84.4 billion reais rise in ""extraordinary credits,"" which include an extra 67.6 billion reais of emergency payments over the October-December period recently approved by President Jair Bolsonaro.
Those payments, which have helped prevent an even steeper economic downturn and boosted Bolsonaro's approval ratings, will be paid at 300 reais a month, half the April-September rate.
Overall, the Economy Ministry raised its 2020 primary expenditure forecast by 63.6 billion reais from July's report to 2.046 trillion reais, and lowered its net revenue forecast by 10 billion reais to 1.185 trillion reais.
The estimates were based on the government's official economic projection of a 4.7% contraction in gross domestic product this year, which would be a record annual decline but not as severe as many feared earlier this year.

Treasury Secretary Bruno Funchal told Reuters on Monday that Brazil's weak fiscal situation was the main reason behind the recent spike in long-term interest rates, and that policymakers had ""no room for error"" in bringing the public accounts back to health next year.

225,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 07:54PM ET</span>",Sunak Urged to Save U.K. Businesses From ‘Ruin’ of Covid Curbs,"(Bloomberg) -- Struggling businesses were just getting back on their feet after the U.K.’s first national lockdown sparked the country’s deepest recession in over a century. Now they face another six months of hardship after Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled a fresh tranche of coronavirus restrictions that will last until spring 2021.
Johnson’s announcement immediately put pressure onto Chancellor Rishi Sunak to set out how the government intends to protect jobs and help businesses through the autumn and winter, just as it winds up its support programs.
The biggest blow is likely to be felt by the hospitality industry, which is being forced to close early -- at 10 p.m. each night from Thursday -- and will suffer from the government’s new instruction to office workers to work from home. That will leave many city centers virtually empty of customers during the working day and after hours.
“Lots of businesses will not survive this and we are going to see more and more people lose their jobs unless we have the support to counterbalance these restrictions,” Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UKHospitality, said. “The Government must immediately announce an exhaustive package of financial support, otherwise our sector is facing ruin.”
Sunak and Johnson are trying to protect the country from a deadly resurgence of the coronavirus that left the U.K. with the highest death toll in Europe, while avoiding an economically disastrous second national lockdown.
In a statement to the House of Commons on Tuesday, the prime minister ordered restaurants and bars to close earlier to stop people passing on the disease after drinking alcohol. He also scrapped plans to allow live audiences back into sporting events next month.
Why the World Worries About a Covid-19 ‘Second Wave’: QuickTake
Tougher enforcement will follow, with higher fines for people failing to wear face coverings and breaking the law on gatherings.
City centers became ghost towns during the first lockdown in the U.K., and the government spent the summer months trying to encourage workers to return to offices and diners to eat out in restaurants.
Sunak is facing growing calls to announce a new package of support for hard-hit sectors when he delivers his autumn Budget later this year.
The Treasury has spent more than 50 billion pounds ($64 billion) on wage subsidies for workers and has backed more than 57 billion pounds of loans to businesses, but this is due to end in the next few weeks. Sunak has previously warned that the current level of support is “not sustainable.”
U.K. Spending on Supporting Jobs Surpasses 50 Billion Pounds
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Tuesday that he supports ending the current furlough program in favor of more targeted support, although he doesn’t wish to tie Sunak’s hands by making recommendations.
But the Chancellor’s own Conservative colleagues are already pushing him to take action. “This will present a testing time, particularly for retail and hospitality over the run-up to Christmas,” MP Cheryl Gillan said in an interview. “The chancellor must again rise to the challenge and continue to bolster some of the sectors to ensure we minimize the damage to the economy.”
London Mayor Sadiq Khan has called for the government to come forward “within days” with financial support for the retail, hospitality and cultural sectors -- alongside ”an immediate targeted extension of the furlough scheme.”
Khan also believes the government’s restrictions don’t go far enough for London and more need to be examined “to protect both lives and livelihoods across the capital.”
But business groups warned that many jobs would be lost and companies would go to the wall without government help.
‘Seriously Fearing’
Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, added: “It’s paramount that the government urgently steps forward with an ambitious second round of support measures to help firms survive. Many businesses -- particularly those at the heart of our night-time economy and events industries -- are now seriously fearing for their futures.”
The Resolution Foundation think tank said phasing in restrictions to control the virus while simultaneously phasing out support for firms and workers was not sustainable.
“The Government should start by providing more financial help to the seven in eight workers who aren’t entitled to the 500-pound self-isolation payments,” its chief executive, Torsten Bell, said. “And with new restrictions being particularly bad news for the hospitality and leisure sectors, support should be focused there too.”
Danny Barnes, 52, a London cab driver for 29 years, said the new restrictions would “crucify” his industry. “I fell through the floor when I heard,” he said in an interview. “My takings have gone by 75% since March and as a taxi driver I was relying on people going back to work. Why six months? Where does six months come from? This government, they keep changing their minds.”

226,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",China’s Unspent Stimulus Pile Primed to Fuel Economic Recovery,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s government has amassed trillions of yuan in unspent money, handing it fiscal firepower to stimulate an economic recovery that’s already leading the world’s rebound from the Covid-19 shock.
The government is selling a record amount of bonds this year to pay for stimulus, but it’s finding it hard to find projects that can be started quickly and also generate necessary returns. As a result, the deposits of all levels of government swelled to 4.8 trillion yuan ($710 billion) at the end of August.
“The funds will definitely be used,” according to Xing Zhaopeng, an economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Shanghai. He estimates fiscal spending from September to December will accelerate, leading to a net injection of about 2 trillion yuan into the economy and financial markets.
Such spending would help the world’s second-largest economy continue expanding this year as it braces for a possible resurgence of the coronavirus outbreak and worsening ties with the U.S. Stronger growth in China also would help a global recovery as a robust domestic market would lead to more imports.
The OECD last week upgraded its forecast for the global economy to a 4.5% contraction this year, an improvement from an earlier estimate of it shrinking 6%.

The government plans to sell 3.75 trillion yuan of new special bonds to pay for infrastructure spending this year, yet as in previous years, it’s hard to find projects that can be started quickly and also generate necessary returns.
Once that money is spent it will support economic activity and increase liquidity in financial markets, helping banks which have struggled as the central bank pulls back on monetary stimulus.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
Fiscal spending need to be accelerated. The funds may be used in three ways: government-led investment, subsidies to small business and for normal operation of government functions.
The debt issuance was mainly in the second and third quarters, while the spending will continue in the fourth quarter. With that in sight, the government deposits would decline in the coming months.
-- David Qu, Bloomberg Economist
Through the end of last week, government at all levels had sold 9.62 trillion yuan of bonds this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and total planned sales are well above the level in 2019.

The pace of government spending started to picking up steam in July, after shrinking in the first three months of the year. A broad gauge of government expenditure, which includes the general public budget and the budget of government funds, rose 3.9% in the first eight months of the year, up from 2.2% in the year through July, according to Bloomberg calculation with data from the Ministry of Finance.
The January-August result was the fastest pace this year, though slower than in any month from 2016 through 2019.
There are signs that this is hurting the economy, with the pace of infrastructure investment moderating for a third straight month in August from a year earlier, according to calculations by  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. based on official data. With the strength of exports possibly peaking and the recovery in consumption still weak, strong investment is crucial to the rebound continuing.

In a joint note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture, Brazil took issue with a report on deforestation used by the French government last week to oppose the current version of the EU-Mercosur trade deal.
The report, which Brazil said was commissioned by the French government, ""reveals the real protectionist concerns of those who commissioned it when dealing with the agricultural concessions made by the EU to Mercosur,"" Brazil's note said.
Brazil's statement came after Augusto Heleno, a national security adviser to President Jair Bolsonaro, told local radio station Bandeirantes the country could retaliate with its own trade blocks against countries that boycotted Brazilian goods on environmental grounds. 
A trade deal would instead, according to the Brazilian statement, reinforce multilateral commitments and best practices on the environment. 
The EU has been holding talks with the Mercosur group of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, the world’s fourth-largest trade bloc. One worry has been the impact of the future deal on forests and the climate.

Bolsonaro has been under international scrutiny for his environmental policies. Earlier on Tuesday, he defended his environmental record at the United Nations.

(Reuters) - Total U.S. home sales soared in August, but a record crunch in housing supply sent prices surging. That is a fresh reminder that while the housing market is outperforming during the coronavirus crisis, good news for some comes with evidence of rising inequality and fewer opportunities for others.
The National Association of Realtors report released on Tuesday shows that the housing market, revived by lower mortgage rates thanks in part to the Federal Reserve's easing of monetary policy, continues to serve as a bright spot, one that President Donald Trump can point to as proof the economy is healing after coronavirus-related lockdowns put millions out of work. 
Incumbent presidents are generally helped at the polls by a strong economy, and hurt by a weak one. 
The home ownership rate rose to 67.9% in the second quarter, up 3.8 percentage points from a year earlier and reaching its highest level in nearly 12 years, according to data released by the Commerce Department in July. But a crunch in housing inventory pushed the median existing home price to a record $310,600 in August, creating obstacles for first-time home buyers.
That is making it hard for some buyers to break into the market and could generate support for some of the housing policies that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said he would pursue if he wins the Nov. 3 election. 
Limited housing supply is a boom for homebuilders. 
Single-family homebuilder confidence hit a record high in September and construction of single-family homes is rising, which could lead to the creation of more construction jobs - a welcome shift during a time of high joblessness. The U.S. unemployment rate was 8.4% in August. 
Some 61% of construction jobs lost during the pandemic have been recovered, better than the rest of the labor market overall, which has recovered about half of the jobs shed. 
Support from blue-collar workers proved instrumental to Trump in the 2016 presidential election, helping him win narrow victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.
Biden is courting the working class through proposals https://joebiden.com/housing/# that promise to provide financial assistance to people saving for down payments on homes, increase the housing supply and lower the prices of homes. 
Trump has rolled back regulations passed by former President Barack Obama's administration that were aimed at combating discriminatory housing practices and segregation. 
Rules would have required communities that receive federal grants and housing aid to assess racial segregation in housing and offer plans to correct it.

With prices rising, some voters may be drawn to policies that could make home ownership more accessible. But others may not feel that any adjustments are needed.

230,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 01:11PM ET</span>","Powell, Mnuchin mull best way to boost aid to small businesses","By Dan Burns, Howard Schneider, Ann Saphir and Andrea Shalal
(Reuters) - Top U.S. economic policymakers opened the door on Tuesday to further aid for small businesses hit by the coronavirus pandemic, but Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said it probably should not be funneled through the central bank.
Stung by criticism that the Fed's Main Street Lending Program had been ineffective in hitting small businesses, Powell told the House Financial Services Committee there was little demand for central bank loans of less than a million dollars.
If Congress wants to get smaller amounts of money to smaller businesses, it should use something like the Paycheck Protection Program adopted earlier in the pandemic, and spare the Fed the difficulty of underwriting loans to ""hundreds of thousands"" of small firms, Powell said in testimony to the Democratic-controlled committee.
""Trying to underwrite the credit of hundreds of thousands of small businesses would be very difficult,"" Powell said.
PPP, which offered loans that would be converted to grants under certain conditions and did not involve strict underwriting of business applicants, ""is a better way to approach that space,"" he said.
Earlier in the same hearing, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was willing for the Fed to loosen the standards of the Main Street program and allow loans as small as $100,000, and that he expected it to suffer some loan defaults. The current loan minimum for the program is $250,000.
""We do expect to take losses and we are working closely with the Fed"" to get more money flowing through the Main Street program, Mnuchin said. Of a potential $600 billion, the program has processed loans of about $2 billion since beginning in June.
But Mnuchin also said he was open to a further PPP-like program, or other follow-up efforts targeted at restaurants and small businesses in industries that have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic and benefited less from the first months of the economic recovery.
IMPROVEMENT AMID RISKS
Powell said the economy has shown ""marked improvement"" since the pandemic drove the country into recession. Still, the path ahead remains uncertain, and the trajectory of both the virus and fiscal policy pose particular risks. 
Noting the rebound in jobs and household spending since the economy cratered in the spring and early summer, Powell said the United States still remains far from where it was, and ""a full recovery is likely to come only when people are confident it is safe to reengage in a broad range of activities"" with the coronavirus under control.
A stalemate in Congress over further aid programs, including the enhanced unemployment benefits that helped sustain household incomes since the spring, is adding to the uncertainty.
Congress passed the $2.3 trillion CARES Act aid package in late March as the foundation of the federal government's economic response to the pandemic. It authorized the Treasury to fund an array of Fed lending and credit programs, including the Main Street program.
Lawmakers have been concerned there has been limited use of that program even as other Fed actions have ignited a stock market rally that helped investors recoup earlier losses. Meanwhile, joblessness remains elevated and roughly 29 million people are claiming some form of unemployment insurance on a week-to-week basis.
The state of the economy and the path of the pandemic are central issues in the Nov. 3 presidential election. 

The pandemic dealt a death blow to the longest-ever U.S. economic expansion when widespread business shutdowns and stay-at-home orders triggered the largest drop in activity since at least World War Two. The Fed responded by cutting interest rates to near zero, ramping up bond purchases and launching nearly a dozen emergency credit facilities, several with Treasury's backing.
Tuesday's hearing, the first of three featuring Powell this week, was chaired by Democratic Representative Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT) of California. On Wednesday, Powell is due to appear before a hearing of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis chaired by Democratic Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina.
On Thursday, Powell and Mnuchin will testify before a hearing of the Senate Banking Committee chaired by Republican Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho.

231,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",British pubs' loss from COVID-19 curbs is supermarkets' gain,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's supermarket sector will be a beneficiary of new curbs on the opening hours of bars and restaurants to tackle a fast-spreading second wave of COVID-19, analysts said on Tuesday.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered England's hospitality venues to start closing at 10 pm from Thursday and restricted them to table service only, warning the measures could last six months.
But their loss of trade will be another boon to the country's major supermarket groups, market leader  Tesco  (L:TSCO),  Sainsbury  's (L:SBRY), Walmart (N:WMT) owned Asda and Morrisons (L:MRW), as will Johnson's call for Britons to work from home where possible.
Britain's initial lockdown in March temporarily transferred the eating out market - bars, cafes, restaurants, school meals and workplace canteens - to the home, shifting about 30% of the nation's food consumption back to stores.
With the lockdown lifted in July that trade was gradually returning to the eating out market, helped by the government's ""Eat Out to Help Out"" subsidy scheme.
But the new curbs will slow this normalisation process.
""It's going to further reduce capacity to the food and beverage sector which is probably going to stick with the retail channel,"" said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.
The new curbs could also have a major effect on the key Christmas period, when traditionally a huge volume of food and drink is consumed outside of the home.
Analysts said that while supermarkets would get a festive fillip at the expense of the food and beverage channel, current restrictions on households mixing could dramatically impact the shape of trade.
Former Sainsbury's boss Justin King, currently a non-executive director of Marks & Spencer (L:MKS), said Christmas was likely to be characterised by people having more smaller gatherings spread over the whole of the two-week holiday period.

""Christmas will still happen, it will still be a sales peak for retail, food in particular, but I think it's likely to be less pronounced around just one or two days as its historically, typically been,"" he told BBC radio.

232,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 12:55PM ET</span>",Fed's Evans sees 'recessionary dynamics' without fiscal aid,"By Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - The U.S. economy risks a longer, slower recovery and ""recessionary dynamics"" if Congress fails to pass a fiscal package to support out-of-work Americans and state and local governments, Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans said on Tuesday.
""Fiscal support is just fundamental,"" Evans said at a virtual meeting of the London-based Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum. 
His own forecast for the U.S. unemployment rate to fall to 5.5% by the end of next year assumes not just a vaccine for the new coronavirus but also a U.S. fiscal package of at least $500 billion or $1 trillion, he said. 
Congress passed a $2.3 trillion package in March, but looks unlikely to deliver any more support before the Nov. 3 presidential election.
""Every week and every month that we go without renewing additional fiscal support that we saw strongly sent out in the spring and summer, we risk a longer period of slow growth if not outright recessionary dynamics,"" Evans said Tuesday.
About 30 million Americans are currently drawing on some form of unemployment insurance. 
In a bid to provide its own measure of support for the still-struggling economy, the Fed last week promised to aim for inflation moderately above 2% for a certain period so that it averages 2% over time. To do so, the U.S. central bank said it would pin interest rates at their near-zero current level until it achieves that overshoot. 
Investors, disappointed the Fed did not back up its new promise with further bond-buying, sent stock prices tumbling after that announcement.
While Evans on Tuesday did not rule out more quantitative easing, he made clear he didn't think it was imminent. 
""The judgment has to be, what are we looking for in terms of further reductions in term premiums or portfolio balance effects if we were to engage in further asset purchases,"" he said. ""I am open-minded; we will have discussions about this."" 
The Fed is already buying $120 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities each month, the yield on the 10-year Treasury is still very low, and the Fed's newly adopted forward guidance is very aggressive, Evans said. 
The larger uncertainties at the moment, he said, include fiscal policy, control of the virus, and whether aggregate demand will hit potholes or the economy will be able to thrive. 
Evans also said the Fed still needs to discuss its new average inflation target, including when it would ""start the clock"" on any period for average inflation. 
If the Fed were to begin averaging this year, with inflation expected to be around 1.5%, and limits its tolerance for an inflation overshoot to a ""timid"" quarter of a percentage point over target, it would take until 2026 to 2028 before the 2% average is achieved.

But, he said, ""we could start raising rates before we start averaging 2%.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Joe Biden would seek to reset the terms of economic and technology ties with China while combating unfair practices and aggressively enforcing U.S. trade laws, a senior foreign policy adviser to the former U.S. vice president said on Tuesday.
Tony Blinken told an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that it was unrealistic to ""fully decouple"" from China, and Biden would focus on expanding U.S. strategic influence by rebuilding ties with allies to pursue a more effective approach, including by setting international technology standards.
""Trying to fully decouple, as some have suggested, from China .... is unrealistic and ultimately counter-productive,"" Blinken said. ""It would be a mistake.""
U.S. President Donald Trump, angered by China's handling of the coronavirus crisis, has repeatedly suggested that the United States could separate its economy from China's, a prospect that worries many U.S. companies given the huge importance of the Chinese market for their future growth prospects.
Despite his frustration with Beijing, Trump argues that the Phase 1 trade deal signed with China in January was a big step forward. He says China is buying far more U.S. goods than ever before, although trade experts say their total purchases will fall far short of targets sets for the first year of the deal.
In political rallies, Trump often warns that Biden would take a less combative approach to China.
Blinken said the trade deal had been ""a debacle"" since it did not address the systemic issues between the world's two largest economies, and China was not even meeting the targets for increased purchases agreed under the limited deal.
""Right now, by every key metric, China's strategic position in stronger and America's strategic position is weaker,"" Blinken told the online event, adding that Biden would focus on rebuilding U.S. competitiveness to better compete with China.
He said the United States should change its approach to be able to negotiate with China and counter its behavior in global markets, but dodged a question on whether he would seek to rejoin or revive the Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership, a trade pact with other Asian countries that Trump canceled.
Biden did support using tariffs when necessary, Blinken said, but also would formulate a broader plan including reshoring production of some essential supplies.
""The so-called Phase 1 deal doesn't address ... the systemic issues that are truly a problem,"" he said, adding that Trump's trade war against China hit U.S. farmers and manufacturers.
""Even on its own very limited basis, China is not making good not on the commitments that have been made,"" he added.
If elected, Biden would ""consistently and aggressively enforce American trade laws anytime foreign cheating posed a threat to American jobs,"" he said.

He said Biden would also use ""tariffs when they're needed, but backed by a strategy, a plan, to use it to succeed, not to fake toughness and to harm our own people.""

The OECD's Pascal Saint-Amans said the Paris-based organisation would publish technical blueprints on Oct. 12 for agreements on how to tax big digital companies across borders and for global minimum corporate tax. 
""There is a dynamic in Europe, there's a dynamic in the U.S,"" Saint-Amans said in an online address to Ireland's Institute of International and European Affairs.
""We for sure in the OECD think that we now have a very solid basis for finalising the negotiation when we have leadership, when we have leadership from the U.S. on the digital topic., when we have leadership from the European countries, at least those that sponsor the global minimum tax,"" he added.
With the blueprints due to be discussed by G20 finance ministers at an Oct. 14 meeting, the aim has been to reach an agreement before the end of the year.
However, that prospect that has all but slipped away as the U.S. elections near, which for now has given Washington cold feet about signing up to a new international agreement.
In the meantime, France has accused the United States of seeking to undermine the talks among nearly 140 countries and urged Europe to prepare an EU-wide digital services tax early next year if the negotiations stall.
Saint-Amans said whoever wins the U.S. presidential election in November, he was confident the next administration would take up the issue as a priority.
""It is a topic which is now on the radar screen of politicians and will be on the radar screen of whatever administration we have in the U.S.,"" he said.

235,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>","Eying more equitable recovery, Bank of Canada's Macklem may commit to above-target inflation","By Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem is likely signing up for inflation running above target as he seeks an economic recovery that raises prospects for everyone, making Canada's central bank just as dovish as the U.S. Federal Reserve, say economists. 
Earlier this month, Macklem said the harsher and more prolonged economic impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic on lower-income workers, women and youth could slow the recovery and make it less durable. 
The BoC has pledged to keep interest rates near zero until inflation is sustainably at its 2% target. If the central bank sees an inclusive recovery as key to achieving that goal, it could surprise financial markets by continuing to support the economy as it returns to its full potential, rather than dialing back to avoid above-target inflation, analysts said.
Hotter-than-expected inflation tends to raise the rate of return demanded by bond investors.
The Bank of Canada is ""committing to an inflation overshoot,"" said Royce Mendes, a senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets. ""The market doesn't seem to have grasped that in Canada as they have in the U.S."" 
Money markets see about a 50% chance that the Bank of Canada will hike interest rates in 2022. That is much earlier than expected by the Federal Reserve, which unveiled last month a new monetary policy strategy which would aim for inflation to rise above target for some time, making up for past shortfalls. 
FOCUS ON INEQUALITY
Also, Canada's yield curve is not nearly as steep as the U.S. curve. A steepening curve, when long-term rates climb further above short-term rates, is seen as a sign of rising inflation expectations.
Higher prices tend to hurt lower-income workers the most, but central banks are trying to generate inflation that is driven by rising economic activity rather than reduced supply.
People's purchasing power is not going to be eroded by inflation because ""wages are likely to be higher first and probably more so,"" Mendes said.
Monetary policy that takes account of inequality would complement the goals of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party government. Trudeau is scheduled on Wednesday to unveil what he says is a bold far-reaching plan to help Canada recover from the coronavirus pandemic. 
The government and the Bank of Canada are due next year to renew their agreement on Canada's inflation control target. For nearly three decades, they have determined that the best way for the central bank to maximize the economic well-being of Canadians is to focus on a target of 2%.
With Ottawa shifting toward a more activist fiscal policy and Macklem appearing to support a greater focus on addressing inequality, ""that could soon change,"" said Stephen Brown, a senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, in a research note.

""The implication would likely be that interest rates are kept lower for longer, and periods of inflation above 2% are tolerated to achieve other objectives,"" Brown said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's banks must make the fight against dirty money a ""top priority"" or risk facing more severe fines, Bank of England Deputy Governor Sam Woods said on Tuesday.
Global banks, including UK-based HSBC,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), face fresh scrutiny on their efforts to curb money laundering after a cache of leaked documents showed they transferred more than $2 trillion in suspect funds over nearly two decades.
Woods said it was vital that banks played their part in fighting financial crime as the ""FinCEN"" leaks were a good reminder of how criminals will use the financial system for their own ends.
""If the banks get this wrong, then costs for them are very severe, as you have seen in recent years the big fines here in the UK and in the U.S.,"" Woods told Bloomberg TV.
""They have been doing a lot but they'll need to do more, and unfortunately this is one of those things that the job is never done,"" Woods said, adding that he did not think new rules were necessary at this point.
HSBC has said the information in the reports was historic, while Standard Chartered pointed to investments to improve its control procedures.
Barclays said global banks were supportive of initiatives to improve transparency of how money was held around the world and which should make client due diligence ""a lot easier"".
Global spending on anti-money laundering (AML) software was close to $1.5 billion at end-2019 and is expected to exceed $1.9 billion by end-2023, according to Boston-based financial research and advisory firm Aite Group.
""We have seen that growth ourselves,"" added Rachel Woolley, global director of financial crime at Fenergo, which provides client data management support to more than 80 banks and financial firms including BBVA (MC:BBVA), Westpac and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
""With digital operational resilience a key focus for financial institutions, not to mention the potential wave of AML reform in response to the FinCEN leaks, it stands to reason that significant investment will be made in technology as banks attempt to increase efficiencies and address increasing compliance concerns,"" Woolley told Reuters. 

Earlier on Tuesday, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said it was studying media reports that Singapore banks had informed U.S. regulators of suspicious transactions, adding that it would take ""appropriate action"" based on the outcome of its review.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told people to work from home where possible and ordered bars and restaurants to close early to tackle a fast-spreading second wave of COVID-19.
Around 22,000 Barclays staff have remained working in its offices worldwide throughout the pandemic, as designated key workers needed to keep the financial system ticking over.
Banks including Barclays had in recent weeks begun to return more staff to office-based working, mainly in Britain where the government had earlier encouraged more people to resume their daily commutes to support city centre economies.

More lenders are expected to follow suit, telling all but essential staff to revert to working from home, a source at another big British bank said on Tuesday.

The announcement marks the first tangible step - albeit a small one - towards making the ECB's monetary policy greener, one of the key objectives set by Christine Lagarde when she took charge of the bank last year.
From Jan 1, banks will be allowed to post as collateral for ECB credit bonds that link their interest payments to compliance with the European Union's taxonomy regulation - its framework for sustainable investment - or one or more of the United Nations' sustainable development goals.
Those goals include fighting poverty as well as climate change.
""This further broadens the universe of Eurosystem-eligible marketable assets and signals the Eurosystem’s support for innovation in the area of sustainable finance,"" the ECB said.
It added the same class of bonds will also become eligible for the bank's asset purchase programmes, which cover both sovereign and corporate debt. 
While the broad class of bonds labelled as green tie money raised to individual projects, sustainability-linked bonds are tied to specific social or environmental goals which, if not met, oblige companies to step up their interest payments. 
Pioneered by Italian utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) in 2019, such sustainability-linked bonds remain rare, and there are only four such issues currently in the market.
By contrast, around $90 billion worth of green bonds were issued in Europe in the first half of this year, 46% percent of the world's total, according to Refinitiv data. 

EU rules define an economic activity as environmentally sustainable if it makes a ""substantial contribution"" to one of its six objective, which relate to climate change mitigation, protection of water, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and protection of biodiversity.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's recent market volatility and a surge in borrowing costs are a ""warning"" that the government must rein in spending and get back on a more stable fiscal footing, the country's top treasury official told Reuters.
While appearing relaxed and insisting there were no problems funding a crisis-fueled record deficit, Treasury Secretary Bruno Funchal said the government needed to get its fiscal and economic reform agenda back on track next year.
""We have no room for error. The (market) prices reflect the situation. It is a warning,"" Funchal said in an interview with Reuters over video conference late on Monday.
Brazilian interest rate curves have steepened sharply in recent weeks, as traders price in official rates being kept at a record low 2.00% for a long time while growing fiscal uncertainty has pushed up longer-term yields.
The shift, which reflects higher risk premiums demanded from investors lending to the Treasury, has driven some parts of the curve to its steepest since the historical highs hit in May and close to exceeding even those levels.
""It is a consequence of our situation. The fiscal side is under a lot of pressure, and...creates certain instability,"" Funchal said.
Huge spending to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic has pushed the budget deficit and public debt to record levels. Economy Minister Paulo Guedes insists that emergency spending will end this year but President Jair Bolsonaro, whose approval ratings have risen as a result, appears more willing to keep the taps open.
The volatility and surge in premiums demanded by investors have seen the Treasury fail to sell all the bonds offered at several floating rate debt auctions in recent months. On Friday, it sold barely a fifth of the short-term notes on offer.
Treasury has played this down, saying some auctions attract stronger demand than others depending on market conditions and the amount on offer. It notes that with the central bank's benchmark Selic interest rate at a record low 2.00%, the average cost of funding Brazil's federal debt has never been lower.
Funchal said there have been no discussions with central bank president Roberto Campos Neto about intervening in the market, buying bonds to bring down longer-term yields and flatten the curve.
""I haven't had a conversation with Roberto. We work together to reduce this (market) pressure by advancing an agenda (of reforms). But regarding the purchase of securities, we haven't spoken yet,"" Funchal said.
The central bank was granted emergency powers earlier this year to buy public debt but has yet to do so. Policymakers have said any bond purchases will address market dislocation and ensure the market functions smoothly.
The Treasury has to refinance 835 billion ($154 bln) of debt maturing in the next 12 months, a fifth of Brazil's total. In calendar year 2021, almost 900 billion reais worth needs refinanced.
Funchal said the Treasury weighs up the ""trade off"" at every auction between issuing short-term securities, which is cheaper but shortens the debt profile, and issuing longer-dated bonds which is more expensive but lengthens the debt profile.

Russia announced the plan, which is expected to bring in 340 billion roubles ($4.5 billion) a year, last week against the backdrop of a falling rouble, loans to support crisis-stricken Belarus and expectations of three years of budget deficit.
Lawmakers voted to approve the bill in the first of three readings in the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament.

""It was fundamental to regulate remote working to protect the rights of workers,"" Iglesias said in an interview with state-owned TV channel TVE. 
Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz had told him about the agreement late on Monday, he said.
Under the government's draft proposal seen by Reuters, companies would have to bankroll all expenses employees may have when working from home, including computer equipment and furniture, while employees can ask for flexible working hours.
The benefits would only apply to employees who stay home for at least 30% of their work schedule, and employers will have the right to monitor workers' online presence while respecting dignity and privacy, and to ask them to be flexible about working hours. 
All home working arrangements have to be volunatry, both for employers and employees.
The new rules, if approved by parliament, would not apply to home working schedules that were put in place specifically to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. 
Three months after the official end of Spain's lockdown, millions of workers are still working remotely as social distancing rules limit office capacity.
The labour ministry is also seeking an extension of a furlough scheme that is due to expire on Sep. 30. 
The lockdown marked a big change for Spaniards mainly unaccustomed to clock in from home. Only 3.5% of Spanish workers partly worked from home in 2019, compared with a 9% average in the European Union, according to Eurostat. 

With 671,468 cumulative infections, Spain has the highest number of coronavirus cases in Western Europe. More than 30,663 people have died since the start of the pandemic.

Britain will soon unveil new legislation for regulating the City of London, which for decades has complied with rules written in Brussels that end in December, when Brexit transition arrangements expire.
Leaving the European Union has raised hopes of a regulatory ""Brexit dividend"" that will help banks and insurers in Europe's biggest financial centre maintain global competitiveness.
""We should approach that in the spirit of, let's have high standards here in London and here in the UK, but let's get back to a more British way of doing that regulation -- things that can be tough but less bureaucratic,"" Woods told a City Week online event.

""It would have been impossible to agree in the European context as one person's big bank is another person's small bank,"" Woods said.

Investing.com -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin update Congress on the state of the economy; global stocks bounce weakly after Monday’s rout, and U.S. markets are set to open mixed; Sterling falls again as the U.K. government abandons its efforts to get people back to the workplace and oil is up ahead of API inventory data: here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, September 22nd.
1. Powell, Mnuchin to testify before Congress
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell begin two days of testimony before Congress on the state of the economy at 8:30 AM ET.
For once, it may be Mnuchin’s comments that get the most attention, since Powell’s stance is already known and was reiterated only last week.
By contrast, Mnuchin’s comments come at a time when faith in a fresh package of economic support measures has all but collapsed: Wall Street analysts were near-unanimous in interpreting the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the weekend as a serious setback, inasmuch as the task of filling her position will inflame tensions between the two major parties and make agreement on other issues, such as fiscal policy, impossible.
2. Elon's expectation management
Elon Musk engaged in some expectation management ahead of its hotly-awaited Battery Day event, which also coincides with the company’s annual shareholder meeting.
Musk warned via Twitter that the company still faces “significant shortages” of battery cells from 2022 “even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed…unless we also take action ourselves.”
But he added that the process of scaling up its own manufacturing had problems of its own, meaning that whatever the company announces at the event is unlikely to enter mass production before 2022.
“The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood,” Musk said via Twitter. “It’s 1000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes. The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself.”
4. U.S. stocks set to open mostly higher
U.S. stocks are set for a mostly higher opening, with tech stocks outperforming again on the expectation that a credible long-term growth narrative will offer the best defense against any new bear market.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 16 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures were up 0.2% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.7%.
Global stocks staged a modest rebounded after their worst daily rout in three months. Asian markets, which had avoided Monday’s carnage, were dragged down, but Europe’s which had closed before the end-of-day bounce in the U.S., recouped around one-third of their losses.
The mood continued to be overshadowed by the UK, which effectively abandoned its campaign to get the country back into the office and formally advised people to carry on working from home if possible.
Aside from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), stocks likely to be in focus later include  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), which reports quarterly earnings after the closing bell, and video games publishers of all stripes, after Microsoft’s $7.5 billion deal for Bethesda Softworks’ parent company illustrated where Satya Nadella expects the growth to be while the pandemic lasts.
4. TikTok Deal Hits Snag
Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) and Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) efforts to secure a stake in TikTok’s U.S. operations look in jeopardy after negative comments from both President Donald Trump and the Chinese Global Times.
“If we find that they don't have total control, then we are not going to approve the deal,” Trump said on Monday.
That runs contrary to comments from ByteDance, TikTok’s owner, which stressed that it will not only retain an 80% stake in TikTok Global, the U.S.-based subsidiary it intends to create for the video-streaming service, but also that it has no plans to transfer ownership of the algorithms that power it.
5. Oil jittery ahead of API
Crude oil prices recovered the $40 level again but were jittery ahead of the release of U.S. inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute at 4:30 PM ET.
By 6:30 AM, U.S. crude futures were up 1.2% at $40.00 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent was up 1.3% at $41.98 a barrel.
Oil had tumbled on Monday in a general rout for risk assets, but had largely front-run the weakness in equities two weeks ago. Prices were supported by doubts about the viability of a peace deal that could see Libya return 1 million barrels a day of crude to world markets."

""We're very unfortunately seeing a much faster and larger return of COVID. Obviously that does reinforce the downside risks we see in our forecast,"" Bailey said.
The government said on Tuesday that pubs and restaurants must shut by 10 p.m. from Thursday onwards, and urged people to work from home where possible, reversing its previous call for employees to return to offices.
Last week the BoE said the economy had been recovering faster than it had expected in August, but that a resurgence in coronavirus cases could derail this.
Britain's difficulty reaching a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union, and broader global trade tensions, were also risks, Bailey added.
Bailey said parts of the retail sector and the housing market had been performing strongly, but he was concerned the underlying rate of unemployment was higher than the most recent 4.1% official figure for the three months to July.
The BoE forecasts unemployment will rise to 7.5% later this year, after a government job support programme ends next month. Bailey said the furlough scheme had been useful, but any replacement was for finance minister Rishi Sunak to decide on.
NEGATIVE RATES
Last week the BoE said it would look into how in practice it could take interest rates below zero -- something Bailey and other policymakers said previously was an option.
Some people in financial markets read this as a signal that the BoE was growing more enthusiastic about negative rates, which put downward pressure on sterling, but Bailey rejected that on Tuesday.
""It doesn't imply anything about the possibility of us using negative instruments,"" he said. ""We have looked hard at the question of what scope is to cut interest rates further and particularly negative interest rates.""
Sterling rallied around a cent against the U.S. dollar and a similar amount against the euro after Bailey's comments.
""It's not at all clear that (negative rates are) going to work for the UK economy. But I think the Bank will have a better line of sight on whether it needs to do more come that Nov. 5 meeting,"" said Gavin Friend, FX strategist at NAB Group.
The Japanese and euro zone central banks have cut rates below zero to encourage banks to lend instead of holding cash.
Bailey described other countries' experiences of negative rates as a ""mixed bag"", with their effectiveness depending on the structure of the banking system and the timing of the move.

Cutting below zero would hurt banks' profits and potentially their readiness to lend, the BoE has said -- and could create problems with old computer systems not designed to accept negative rates.

Investing.com -- India has emerged as the world’s new hotspot for Covid-19: the virus is running rampant through the country’s densely-populated cities and a hinterland with often under-developed health infrastructure. As of last week, it had over 5.5 million cases, second only to the U.S.
New infections nearly touched 100,000 per day last week, casting a pall over Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 70th birthday but – thankfully – not distracting the government from the need to cool down tension on its border with China.
The usual weekend dip in registered infections and deaths may be only a temporary reprieve: the lack of a comprehensive state safety net has forced the government into reopening the economy before it has the virus properly under control, and evidence from Europe and the U.S. suggests that that risks a further surge in cases.
The country’s most famous tourist attraction, the Taj Mahal, reopened on Monday for the first time in six months, but reportedly sold only 300 tickets out of a possible maximum of 5,000."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday it was proposing to stop insurers from charging repeat car and home insurance customers more than new clients in a move it described as ""radical"".
Insurers' treatment of customers is under increasing regulatory scrutiny, adding to pressures on their bottom lines as they deal with costly claims caused by COVID-19.
The latest move comes just a week after the FCA successfully brought a test case over some business interruption policies.
The regulator said that when a customer renews their home or motor insurance policy they should pay no more than if they were new to their provider through the same sales channel.
""The FCA estimates that its proposals will save consumers 3.7 billion pounds ($4.73 billion) over 10 years,"" said Christopher Woolard, the FCA's interim chief executive.
It singled out ""price walking"" or complex pricing practices that allow insurers to raise prices for consumers who renew their car and home insurance policies year after year.
The Association of British Insurers said insurers and brokers had already begun to tackle the issue of loyal customers being penalised.
But Sheldon Mills, Interim Executive Director of Strategy and Competition at the FCA, told a media briefing they had not gone far enough.
""This is a radical change we are putting forward today,"" he said.
Consumer champion Citizens Advice said it was pleased the FCA was taking ""strong action to crack down on this systemic scam"".
The FCA said it had identified 6 million policyholders paying high or very high margins in 2018, who could have saved 1.2 billion pounds.
The FCA is also proposing rules requiring insurers to consider how they offer fair value to customers over the longer term, and to report data to the watchdog so that it can check the new rules are being followed.
The proposals are being put out to public consultation until January, with final rules published next year.
Shares in motor and home insurers Admiral (L:ADML), RSA (L:RSA) and  Direct Line  (L:DLGD) fell 2-5%.
Insurers were also due by Tuesday to tell small business customers the implications of last week's ruling that some of them were wrong to reject tens of thousands of claims from firms battered by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Woolard said the watchdog had not yet decided whether to appeal some aspects of the ruling. Insurers have also said they were still considering whether to appeal.

256,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>",German economy's Covid hit may be smaller than feared,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany may weather its pandemic-induced recession better than expected, private sector indicators suggested on Tuesday, in a hopeful sign for the economy that traditionally serves as Europe's driver of growth.
With much economic activity still constrained by COVID-19, Germany's government moved swiftly to boost spending and that cash, along with another shot in the arm from the European Central Bank, appears to have cushioned the pandemic's impact. 
Gross domestic product is now only seen shrinking by 5.2% this year, the Ifo institute projected, more optimistic than its previous estimate for a 6.7% drop and the Bundesbank's 7.1% forecast.
""The decline in the second quarter and the recovery are currently developing more favourably than we had expected,"" Ifo chief economist Timo Wollmershaeuser said.
For 2021 it cut its growth forecast to 5.1% from 6.4%, but even that indicates that Germany's economy could be close to its pre-crisis level by the end of next year. The ECB still expects the euro zone as a whole to need a further year to make up the decline.
Part of the forecast improvement is unexpectedly resilient consumption, and the HDE retail association said it expects nominal retail sales to grow by 1.5% this year, a sharp upward revision from its previous estimate for a 4% drop.
However, both it and the Ifo pointed to unusual uncertainty in their projections, with a second wave of infections and potential government restrictions seen as risk factors.
HDE said online sales and stimulus measures that have included a temporary VAT cut and cash handouts for parents, had been key factors in boosting private consumption, HDE said.
Job protection schemes were also maintaining relatively high employment levels, and keeping a lid on household income losses.

Unemployment has barely risen compared to some other major economies and the rise in the jobless rate may top out at just 5.9% this year from 5.0% last year, before dropping to 5.7% percent in 2021, Ifo said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's top court on Tuesday gave its backing to European cities cracking down on short-term rentals of private homes to solve a housing crunch, dealing a setback to homesharing site Airbnb.
From Amsterdam to New York and Paris, authorities have blamed Airbnb for worsening housing shortages in their cities which have pushed out lower-income residents. France is Airbnb's second largest market after the United States.
The Court of Justice of the European Union's (CJEU) ruling came after a French court sought guidance in a case involving two Parisian apartment owners who were fined by the city's authorities for letting out second homes on Airbnb without permission.
Owners in Paris are obliged to declare the renting of second homes to the authorities. 
The Luxembourg-based CJEU said the French measure was justified as it is proportionate, limited in material and geographical scope, and does not cover the rental of own or primary homes.
""National legislation making the repeated short-term letting of accommodation to a transient clientele which does not take up residence there subject to authorisation is consistent with EU law,"" judges said. 
""Combating the long-term rental housing shortage constitutes an overriding reason relating to the public interest justifying such legislation,"" they said.
Airbnb, which is not a party in the case, said the ruling will have little to no impact on its operations in Paris as the vast majority of hosts on its platform in the city rent out their own or primary homes. 
It is not clear what the percentage is in other cities however, as Airbnb does not provide figures.
""We welcome this ruling that will help clarify the rules for hosts who share secondary home in Paris,"" the company said in a statement.
""We look forward to working closely with local authorities on proportionate regulation that puts local families and communities first and works for all.""
Paris caps short-term home rental at 120 days a year.

The cases are C-724/18 Cali Apartments and C-727/18 Procureur general pres la cour d'appel de Paris et ville de Paris.

The HDE association pointed to booming online sales and the government's stimulus measures, such as a temporary VAT cut and cash handouts for parents, which it said were boosting private consumption and supporting the retail sector as a whole.
Still, it called on Berlin to help small retailers in urban areas as they were being hit especially hard by the crisis.
""The coronavirus crisis is accelerating the structural transformation in retailing,"" HDE said, adding that consumers were changing their shopping habits to the benefit of online retailers and to the disadvantage of small stores in cities.
Adjusted for price effects, HDE expects retail sales to remain stable in 2020 year-on-year.

260,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 04:36AM ET</span>",BOE’s Bailey Plays Down Chance of Negative Rates on Virus Risks,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England isn’t close to negative interest rates despite the resurgence of the coronavirus reinforcing downside risks to the U.K. economy, according to Governor Andrew Bailey.
While the bank has “looked hard” at rate cuts and negative rates are in the toolbox, planned technical work on the policy is to examine whether it can be implemented rather than a signal it is coming, he said.
The pound pared most of its earlier decline on that comment. It was down 0.2% at $1.2791 at 9:10 a.m London time. Investors pushed back bets on a rate cut to May, compared with earlier speculation that it would happen in March.
Bailey spoke in a webinar shortly after the government urged people to work from home again if possible, reversing its drive to get employees back into workplaces. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will announce a fresh wave of restrictions later on Tuesday to help control the coranavirus.
The U.K. is heading into the final few months of 2020 facing renewed economic pain from virus restrictions, a possible spike in unemployment as wage-support programs end, and a potentially messy Brexit at the end of the year.
Policy makers are already predicted to expand their bond-buying plan in November. Bailey said that the economy remains 7-10% smaller than it was before the crisis, and the “hard yards” remain ahead.
The recovery has been rapid so far and slightly better than expected in the third quarter, but it has been a “very uneven story” and unemployment is higher than reported.
Economists have argued that the upcoming stress warrants more monetary stimulus from the BOE. The bank’s current economic projections, which see a recovery pre-crisis levels next year, are based on an easing of virus uncertainty and avoiding a nationwide lockdown.
Shutdown Hit
Johnson is set to announce hospitality venues across England will have to close by 10 p.m. from Thursday and will be limited to table service only as ministers clamp down on socializing. Some lawmakers have called for more severe measures, included a short lockdown to stem the rise in infections.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) estimates that a two-week shutdown of the U.K. hospitality sector could knock at least 2% off the nation’s gross domestic product. While that’s far less severe than the record 20% contraction seen during the widespread lockdown earlier this year, it could stifle the U.K.’s recovery, which Bailey said had so far been “quite rapid” and stronger than officials predicted.
The measures may also worsen an expected jump in unemployment when government support programs expire next month. Bailey said labour demand is currently weak, and, in one sign of the challenges ahead, U.K. hotel operator  Whitbread  (LON:WTB) Plc said Tuesday it plans to cut as many as 6,000 jobs, or 18% of its workforce.

“The way back is long and fraught with uncertainty,” the Stockholm-based bank, which kept its main rate at zero as expected, said on Tuesday.
“To provide support to economic developments and help inflation to rise towards the target, the Riksbank is continuing its asset purchases and offering liquidity in all the programs launched so far this year. The repo rate is held unchanged at zero,” the bank said.
The Riksbank has repeatedly made clear it thinks bond purchases are a better way to support the economy in the current crisis than rate cuts. The bank has pledged to buy 500 billion kronor ($56 billion) worth of securities, taking it into uncharted territory in its experimentation with unconventional policies.
After Tuesday’s announcement, it seems clear that “QE remains the prime policy tool if things would turn out worse” than the bank’s forecasts indicate, according to Claes Mahlen, head of trading strategy at Handelsbanken in Stockholm.
TOPLive: Follow Riksbank Rate Decision in Real Time
The bank’s decision to purchase corporate bonds has proved particularly controversial. The legal adviser to Sweden’s parliamentary committee responsible for drafting a new Riksbank Act has suggested the program might be unlawful. And investors have warned that the purchases will distort bond prices in a market that’s already rebounded from the Covid crisis.
The Riksbank hired consultants from BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) to help analyze Sweden’s corporate bond market as part of its contested QE plan. But it has refused to share the findings of that study with the public, drawing criticism from market participants.
Read: Sweden Heavily Redacts BlackRock Report on Credit Market Woes
Tuesday’s rate announcement comes a day after Sweden’s government revealed plans to increase public debt to the tune of $12 billion, as part of its efforts to reboot the largest Nordic economy. It’s the latest signal that Sweden is relying increasingly on fiscal policy to steer its way through the Covid crisis.
The Outlook
The Riksbank’s forecast points to zero rates through the third quarter of 2023, which is as far as it guidance goes. The bank raised its GDP estimate for 2020 to a 3.6% contraction from a 4.5% decline previously. The rebound in 2021 will also be slightly stronger than expected earlier, at 3.7% growth.
Inflation will stay below the bank’s 2% target throughout the forecast horizon, according to the Riksbank.
“The September report confirms our view that the Riksbank board is in a wait and see mode after introducing a string of support measures between March and July,” analysts at SEB said in a note. “Our main scenario is that the Riksbank will continue the QE-program according to current plans, but we think that the bar for expanding the program is low if there are any signs that the recovery is derailed. A rate cut does not seem to have come any closer and we predict the repo rate to be unchanged for the foreseeable future.”
As in previous statements, the Riksbank said it is keeping the door open for rate cuts.
“The Riksbank is prepared to continue to use the tools at its disposal to provide support to the economy and inflation,” it said. “The repo rate can also be cut if this is assessed to be an effective measure, particularly if confidence in the inflation target were to be threatened.”

The move came as global banks faced a fresh scandal about dirty money on Monday as they sought to limit the fallout from a cache of leaked documents showing they transferred more than $2 trillion in suspect funds over nearly two decades. 
Banks from many countries were named in the report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and based on leaked documents obtained by BuzzFeed News.
The report was based on 2,100 leaked suspicious activity reports (SARs), covering transactions between 1999 and 2017, filed by banks and other financial firms with the U.S. Department of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). 
""MAS is aware that Singapore banks were mentioned in media reports on suspicious transaction reports filed with FinCEN,"" the city-state's central bank said in an email on Tuesday.
""Although suspicious transaction reports in and of themselves do not imply that the transactions are illicit, MAS takes such reports very seriously,"" it said.

It said it will take ""appropriate action"" based on the outcome of its review, adding that ""Singapore's regulatory framework to combat money laundering meets international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The air travel market has shifted toward last-minute bookings, one-way flights and more domestic trips as consumers grapple with fast-moving changes due to the coronavirus pandemic, a report from online search and booking site Skyscanner shows.
The new trend will be an advantage for low-cost carriers that are able to offer competitive pricing amid an uncertain future for business travel, which was previously a major profit driver for full-service airlines, the report said.
""I think generally we have seen if you look at the market prices are much keener than you would expect,"" Skyscanner Vice President Commercial and Flights Hugh Aitken told Reuters in a phone interview. ""That just reflects that airlines have capacity and need to fill that capacity."" 
Visits to the Skyscanner website, owned by Trip.com Group Ltd, are down by 60% to 70% due to the pandemic's impact on travel demand, Aitken said.
Searches to travel within a week have been trending upward since June, around the time that lockdowns ended in many countries, according to Skyscanner's data. Globally, these searches are up about 20% from a year earlier. 
""When you see restrictions being lifted there is a frenzy,"" Aitken said, using the example of when Britain stopped requiring quarantines on return for many countries. 
""But equally when we see the potential that a restriction will be added there is a big lift because that is just people ... scrambling on how to get home again,"" he said.
Domestic travel searches are higher globally, mainly in Asia, though there has been a slight improvement in international searches in recent months, according to the Skyscanner report on Tuesday.
Searches for longer-dated trips are becoming more popular as travellers bet on future border openings, including examples such as from the United Kingdom to Orlando and New York for next year, Skyscanner said.
The International Air Transport Association said passenger travel demand was down 79.8% in July from a year earlier and forecasts it will take until 2024 for travel to return to pre-crisis levels.

Skyscanner says it will take several years before business travel returns to previous levels, forcing some airlines to rethink their strategies and reconfigure their plane cabins.

Though health authorities temporarily eased those measures for two weeks from Sept. 14, they will return to tougher guidelines again from Sept. 28 during the Chuseok holiday.

The relative success of Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in containing the virus will help their economies recover at a faster pace than India, Capital Economics Ltd. said in a report to clients. India is now one of the world’s virus hotspots, with about 5.5 million cases.
“New cases per capita in these three economies are far lower than in India,” said Shilan Shah, senior economist at Capital Economics in Singapore. “This has enabled a faster rebound in activity.”
As a result, the drop in gross domestic product in 2020 will be much less severe in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Whereas, India is expected to post a double-digit slump.
Although per capita testing is higher in India compared to its neighbors, the share of tests coming back positive have fallen in the three neighboring economies, suggesting genuine progress in getting the virus under control, according to Our World in Data figures produced by the University of Oxford and Global Change Data Lab.
“Whatever the reasons, the important point from the economic perspective is that the lower prevalence of cases has meant that containment measures have been scaled back at a quicker pace than in India,” said Shah.

The U.S. Department of Commerce issued an order requiring Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google to remove WeChat for downloads on national security grounds, but a U.S. judge blocked the move on Sunday. The U.S. Commerce Department said on Monday it will challenge the order.
WeChat was installed about 54,000 times between Friday and Saturday, 28 times the 1,900 downloads seen in the same two-day period a week before, according to data analytics firm Sensor Tower. It said WeCom, an office collaboration app, also saw a jump in downloads in the United States over that period.
The United States has launched a series of measures in recent months cracking down on Chinese tech firms and apps, citing national security grounds, as the world's two largest economies butt heads on issues ranging from trade and technology to the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Tencent, which has denied its apps pose a national security risk, has said updates of the app for existing U.S. users may be negatively affected should Apple and Google remove WeChat from their stores.
WeChat is an all-in-one mobile app that combines messaging, social media, payment functions and other services and boasts more than a billion users globally.
WeCom, which was rebranded from Tencent's office collaboration app WeChat Work only days after U.S. President Donald Trump first said he would ban WeChat in August, was installed 58,000 times in the United States on Friday and Saturday, 193 times the 300 downloads it saw over the same period a week prior, according to Sensor Tower estimates.
After downloading WeCom, users can now link their WeChat account to it and add their WeChat contacts, a Reuters test showed. WeCom users can then message, create chat groups, and even receive virtual money from WeChat friends without their WeChat contacts having to download WeCom.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank is assessing various monetary policy options including currency market intervention and negative rates to meet its inflation and employment goals, Deputy Governor Guy Debelle said on Tuesday.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) had slashed interest rates to a record low 0.25% in an emergency meeting in mid-March to backstop the economy from the coronavirus crisis. 
It also launched an ""unlimited"" government bond buying programme and a cheap funding facility for banks. It has held rates since then, saying it would maintain its ""highly accommodative settings"" as long as required to support the flagging economy. 
On Tuesday, Debelle said the board was assessing other policy options ""given the outlook for inflation and employment is not consistent with the Bank’s objectives over the period ahead.
One option being considered is buying government bonds with maturities beyond three years. The RBA is currently targeting three-year yield at 0.25%.
Foreign exchange intervention was another potential tool, though Debelle said it was not clear whether this would be effective given the Australian dollar was ""aligned with fundamentals."" [AUD/]
A third option would be to lower the cash rate without taking it into negative territory. And, the final option was negative rates, though Debelle said the empirical evidence on its success was mixed. 
The RBA has previously said on multiple occasions that negative rates were ""extraordinarily unlikely"" in Australia and Debelle reaffirmed that stance.
The Australian dollar  fell briefly below 72 U.S. cents after the speech but pared some of the losses to last fetch $0.7223. 
""The nuance in our view was slightly dovish,"" RBC economist Su-lin Ong said.
The RBA’s easing bias was also reinforced by Debelle's emphasis on a bumpy and uneven recovery and challenging labour market outlook. 
""By continuing to highlight other policy measures without committing to any timelines, especially ahead of the upcoming 2020/21 Commonwealth Budget, the RBA is employing maximum flexibility,"" Ong added.
The Budget is due on Oct.6

""In these uncertain times, that would appear prudent.""

“I don’t think there is as much of an imperative about a new fiscal package as there might have been” in July or August, Bullard said Monday in a Bloomberg Television interview with Kathleen Hays. “It seems like, at least in some broad macroeconomic type of calculation, we have enough resources to cover this.”
Bullard’s view contrasts with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has urged additional fiscal aid and sometimes put the message in dire terms, as well as other Fed officials. In congressional testimony to be delivered Tuesday, Powell said the U.S. faces a long recovery with a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the pandemic.
The U.S. economy may shrink 3%-4% this year, which is less than half of what was expected early during the crisis, so the $3 trillion in pandemic aid passed by Congress as well as the Fed’s easy monetary policy stance should help support growth during the recovery, Bullard said.
‘Enough in the Pipeline’
“We might be able to sustain a recovery through this,” he said. “I’m hopeful we still have enough in the pipeline to push us through, get the growth going in the second half of the year. That certainly seems to be what’s happening in the third quarter. I think that will continue in the fourth quarter and the first part of next year.”
Bullard said he supported last week’s strengthened forward guidance, noting that the two dissents from fellow Fed presidents –- one from a hawk, one a dove –- suggests the decision was “about right.”
The Federal Open Market Committee last week signaled rates would stay near zero through 2023 and adapted their post-meeting statement to reflect their new strategy of allowing inflation to rise above 2% after periods of under-performance.
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan dissented, explaining he would “rather leave those judgments to future committees because I think the world is going to look very different post-pandemic.” Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari dissented in favor of delaying a rate hike until “core inflation has reached 2% on a sustained basis.”

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic echoed those remarks and cited as an example that the Fed can offer loans but cannot provide grants to businesses or communities. ""These are things much more institutional that we're all going to have to address,"" Bostic said. 
The Fed issued new guidance at its meeting last week, stressing that interest rates will stay low until the U.S. economy is on track to reach its goal of 2% average inflation over time. The approach puts more emphasis on addressing shortfalls in employment, including gaps between Black and white workers and other demographics. 

Bostic reiterated the Fed's commitment to support all workers through the coronavirus economic crisis. ""We've acted fast and we've acted boldly and we're going to continue to be there,"" Bostic said. ""We're not going to step away until everyone has gotten to a better place.""

270,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 06:50PM ET</span>",Two key GOP senators propose $28.8 billion in airline assistance to avoid job cuts,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two key Republican senators on Monday introduced legislation that would authorize $28.8 billion in payroll assistance to avoid thousands of airline industry layoffs set to begin on Oct. 1.
Senators Roger Wicker, who chairs the Commerce Committee, and Susan Collins, who chairs the appropriations subcommittee overseeing airline issues, introduced the measure that would grant airlines a new bailout days before existing payroll support runs out.
Airlines are making a last-ditch effort to win funding, but face an uphill battle with Congress shifting its attention to the pending Supreme Court vacancy, congressional aides say.
The chief executives of some major U.S. airlines are expected to be on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, urging lawmakers to act, and to make TV appearances on Wednesday, two people briefed on the matter said. 
The bill would tap $11.2 billion in new funds and $17.4 billion in funding repurposed from other unspent funds from prior coronavirus relief measures. 
Congress in March approved $25 billion in payroll assistance but required airlines not to cut jobs or flights through Sept. 30.
The White House said last week it is also open to a stand-alone measure to aid airlines, though congressional aides say that is unlikely to win passage given aid requests from so many other struggling industries
The Wicker-Collins bill would dedicate $25.5 billion for new passenger airlines and allow smaller airlines to qualify for 15% additional funds versus the initial round.
It would set aside $300 million for cargo carriers and $3 billion for airport contractors.
Airlines for America, a trade group representing American Airlines (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), United Airlines (O:UAL), Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) and others praised the bill.
""These are dire times for the U.S. airline industry. COVID-19 continues to spread and wreak havoc on the U.S. economy, lasting far longer than anyone envisioned,"" the group said. ""We are running out of time to protect the jobs and livelihoods of these men and women.""
Major airlines that have shed thousands of employees through voluntary exit programs would be entitled to receive the same payroll support they did in the first round. In April, major airlines qualified for about 75% of payroll costs.
Large airlines were required to repay 30% of grants.
American Airlines said without new aid it plans to end service to 15 small communities and furlough about 19,000 workers.
Air travel has plummeted over the last six months as the coronavirus pandemic has claimed nearly 200,000 American lives and prompted many to avoid airports and planes, seriously depressing airline revenues.

Congress also set aside another $25 billion in government loans for airlines, but many have opted not to tap them.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The effects of climate change since 2000 will slow U.S. economic growth slightly over the next 30 years, adding another drag on an economy that will struggle to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic, the Congressional Budget Office said on Monday.
In a new research paper, the nonpartisan budget referee agency studied both positive and negative contributions to gross domestic product, from longer growing seasons in colder climates to drought to damage to factories from more intense storms.
It projected that on net, climate change will reduce real U.S. GDP by an average of 0.03% annually from 2020 to 2050, compared to what U.S. growth would have been if global climate conditions remained the same as they were in 2000.
That reduction in the growth rate, accumulated over 30 years, lowers the CBO's projected level of real GDP output in 2050 by 1%, the paper showed.
The findings were incorporated into the CBO's long-term budget outlook released on Monday, which projected that U.S. federal government debt now is expected to reach nearly double the country's GDP output in 2050 as interest costs from increased borrowing run annual budget deficits higher.[nL2N2GI1C0]
CBO researchers said that some aspects of climate change are incorporated quickly and directly, while others are more indirect and could take longer to manifest themselves. For example, extreme heat that lowers a farmer's crop yield would immediately reduce that farmer's contribution to GDP. A farmer in a cold-weather location might experience a longer growing season, increasing contributions to GDP.
A hurricane that destroys $50 million worth of factory equipment would affect GDP in several ways, including reduced production immediately, and money spent to replace the equipment. But the overall capital stock would be smaller in the future, as a result of foregone investments to pay for the replacement costs, leading to less GDP output in the future, the CBO said.

The CBO said the research comes with a high degree of uncertainty and the projections represent the middle of a range of outcomes.

272,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 06:18PM ET</span>",Bars and Restaurants Face Crackdown as U.K. Fights Covid Surge,"(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson will announce new restrictions on bars and restaurants and appeal directly to Britons for their support as he seeks to halt a surge in coronavirus cases that threatens the U.K.’s fragile economic recovery.
Hospitality venues across England will have to close by 10 p.m. and will be limited to table service only as ministers clamp down on socializing in measures to be announced Tuesday, the prime minister’s office said.
Johnson will consult with senior officials and the leaders of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales at a meeting of the so-called Cobra emergency committee in the morning before briefing Parliament on further curbs. He will then make a broadcast to the nation at 8 p.m.
“No-one underestimates the challenges the new measures will pose to many individuals and businesses,” Johnson’s office said in the email. “We know this won’t be easy, but we must take further action to control the resurgence in cases of the virus and protect the NHS.”
Ministers are trying to strike a balance between controlling the pandemic and avoiding a full lockdown that risks snuffing out the recovery after the economy plunged into its deepest recession for more than 100 years. Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance warned Monday the current infection rate, at which the number of cases is doubling every week, could lead to 50,000 new cases a day by mid-October without urgent action.
‘Probably Exponentially’
Government statistics released Monday showed 1,261 people in England hospitalized with Covid-19, up from 782 a week earlier. Some 154 of these are on ventilators, up from 88. The chief medical officers for the four U.K. nations recommended the coronavirus alert status should rise by one rank to Level 4, meaning cases are “now rising rapidly and probably exponentially.”
Johnson, already facing criticism over failures in the U.K.’s testing system and confused messaging over measures to stop the spread of the disease, came under renewed fire from members of his own party who want restrictions lifted to allow the economy to recover. They accused ministers of stifling debate about their plans in the House of Commons.
Pauline Latham, a Tory MP, asked Health Secretary Matt Hancock to “explain to the prime minister that we actually live in a democracy not a dictatorship,” while Graham (NYSE:GHM) Brady (NYSE:BRC), another member of Johnson’s party, warned that “political judgments are improved by debate and scrutiny.”
Hancock promised there would be a debate in Parliament and said the speed at which decisions have to made during the pandemic means it isn’t always possible to consult lawmakers before decisions are made.
‘Slow the Spread’
London Mayor Sadiq Khan called for further restrictions in the capital and said the failure of the government’s test-and-trace system has resulted in a lack of information about the spread of the disease that makes action inevitable.
“Without adequate testing or contact tracing in London we have no choice but to look at other measures to slow the spread of the virus,” he said in a statement. “Taking firm action now to prevent a deeper and longer lockdown in the future is without a doubt the best thing to both save lives, and protect jobs and our economic recovery.”
Khan’s comments reflect concern that a wave of large-scale restrictions could choke off the nation’s recovery and worsen a spike in unemployment later this year.
The rebound, which has so far been quicker than officials expected, has been helped by resurgent consumer spending, which would be imperiled by widespread closures of pubs and restaurants. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) estimated a two-week shutdown of the U.K. hospitality sector could knock at least 2% off the nation’s gross domestic product.
While the economic hit would likely be less severe than the previous lockdown, major restrictions would also add to the argument for more action from the Bank of England, which said last week a resurgence in the virus is likely to slow the U.K.’s rebound. Officials’ current projections, which see the economy recovering pre-crisis levels next year, are based on an easing of virus uncertainty and avoiding a nationwide lockdown.

""We remain committed to using our tools to do what we can, for as long as it takes, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy,"" 
Powell said in remarks released ahead of Tuesday's appearance before the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, the first of three days of testimony to Congress this week.
Powell's summation of the ""marked improvement"" in the economic landscape largely repeated what he said last week after the Fed's latest policy meeting, at which policymakers promised to keep interest rates pinned at zero until the economy reaches full employment and inflation is on track to modestly overshoot the central bank's 2% target. 
The housing sector has rebounded, consumer spending has recovered about 75% of its decline, and about half of the 22 million jobs lost in the crisis have returned, he said. ""Both employment and overall economic activity, however, remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, and the path ahead continues to be highly uncertain,"" he said.

Powell's speech included an update on the Fed's Main Street Lending program, which now has funded or has in the pipeline 230 loans totaling roughly $2 billion. ""Demand for Main Street loans may increase over time if the pandemic continues to affect the ability of businesses and nonprofits to access credit through normal channels and as other support programs expire,"" he said.

""Economic activity has picked up from its depressed second-quarter level, when much of the economy was shut down to stem the spread of the virus. Many economic indicators show marked improvement,"" Powell is expected to tell the Committee on Financial Services in the U.S. House of Representatives.
""Since mid-March, we have taken forceful action, implementing a policy of near-zero rates, increasing asset holdings, and standing up 13 emergency lending facilities.""
Powell will also acknowledge the rebound in the economy since the pandemic struck in March, but continue to suggest the Fed ""remains committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy for as long as is needed.'
""In the labor market, roughly half of the 22 million payroll jobs that were lost in March and April have been regained as people return to work. Both employment and overall economic activity, however, remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, and the path ahead continues to be highly uncertain.
The Fed chief will continue to call on Congress to roll out fiscal support to maintain the current pace of the recovery. 
Many borrowers will benefit from [the Fed's] programs, as will the overall economy, but for others, a loan that could be difficult to repay might not be the answer. In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed,"" prepared remarks from Powell's testimony said.

276,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 04:50PM ET</span>",U.S. policymakers seize on FinCEN leaks to press for stepped up money-laundering fight,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Advocates of legislation to beef up the U.S. fight against money laundering made a fresh push on Monday to get Congress to act, after new revelations that some leading global banks have been processing payments linked to alleged illicit funds.
A broad, bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers already support the proposed law, which would rework how financial firms keep an eye out for illegal activity. Banks, law enforcement groups and human rights advocates support it as well.
But the legislation has stalled in Congress amid other priorities.
A series of articles called the “FinCEN Files,” launched on Sunday by Buzzfeed News and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), detailed how several global banks moved large sums of allegedly illicit funds for decades despite red flags. The series sent bank stocks tumbling on Monday and prompted new calls for legislative reform. 
""The Buzzfeed story makes clear we need to strengthen, reform and update our nation's anti-money laundering laws,"" Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement. ""This action is long overdue.""
Policymakers, regulators and banks have long acknowledged fundamental flaws in the anti-money laundering system, which relies on banks to file suspicious activity reports, or SARs, when they notice something unusual in a transaction. Those SARs are sent to the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN.
However, the rules around what is deemed ""suspicious"" can be vague, which leads some banks to send too many reports and others to send too few. And the enforcement group is understaffed to handle the millions of SARs that need to be analyzed to determine whether a crime has been committed.
The proposed legislation would make it easier for banks to share information to identify bad actors, let them use technology to help detect suspicious activity more efficiently without breaching privacy laws and require companies to disclose who actually owns them.
The House of Representatives already approved one such bill, another version of which enjoys broad support in the Senate.
Proponents hope the FinCEN Files will spur Congress to pass something before the end of the year.
""This story is a major boost in ensuring that people understand how critical it is that we get to the bottom of who's behind these anonymous shell companies and who's laundering money through our financial system,"" said Clark Gascoigne, the interim executive director of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency (FACT) Coalition, a liberal tax activist group.
Widespread criticism of anti-money laundering rules first kicked off in 2016, after another set of leaked documents known as the Panama Papers came to light.
Since then, bank regulators have tried to streamline their own systems and penalized banks that were not doing enough to comply with existing rules. Banks have said they spent billions of dollars improving technology and scouring customer lists to remove potential risks.
In recent months, regulators also issued industry guidance about monitoring. For example, a group of regulators told banks in August that they would typically face penalties if they are found to have pervasive issues monitoring money laundering, rather than for isolated or technical errors.
The guidance came after industry complaints that existing rules create a heavy workload and expense without much to show for it. The Bank Policy Institute, which represents larger banks, found that only 4% of SARs filed in 2017 merited follow-up from law enforcement.

""There has long been a shared view ... that the (anti-money laundering) framework needs to be modernized,"" said Mike Lee, BPI's chief lobbyist.

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump's bid to quickly fill the U.S. Supreme Court vacancy left by Friday's death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg could end the already remote chance of a pandemic relief package before the Nov. 3 election, bank analysts say. 
In the meantime, the vacancy is adding uncertainty in an already uncertain environment, a top Fed official told Reuters. 
But it may raise the odds of a Democratic sweep in the election, which could clear the way for a bigger stimulus package afterward to fight economic impacts of the coronavirus. 
""The Supreme Court vacancy is likely to motivate the political base of both parties and will displace the coronavirus and geopolitical tensions with China as a dominant topic in voters’ minds,"" UBS economists wrote in a note over the weekend. 
If Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate move to install a conservative judge on the highest U.S. court before the election, they wrote, expect ""an even more aggressive policy agenda by Democrats"" if they retake the Senate and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden beats Trump. 
UBS analysts believe a Biden win is the likeliest election outcome. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to tell lawmakers at three separate hearings on Capitol Hill this week that a new fiscal package is critical to the economy's recovery. Wall Street's main indices hit their lowest in nearly seven weeks on Monday, on fresh concerns a package could be delayed.
Republicans and Democrats in Congress, already deadlocked over a stimulus package, are now focused on the fight over the Supreme Court vacancy, making a package less likely to pass, analysts at TD Securities wrote in a note on Monday. 
The fight over the Supreme Court seat ""might also increase the odds of the Democrats capturing the Senate in the election,"" they wrote, an outcome widely thought to boost chances of a bigger fiscal stimulus. 
That in turn could have big consequences for the speed of a recovery.
""If the 2020 election results in unified Democratic government, this would likely allow a President Biden to pass a large spending increase,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economists wrote in a note before Ginsburg's death. 
That could spark a faster-than-expected recovery, Goldman Sachs analysis suggested, pulling forward the date when the Fed would need to start to raise interest rates ""by up to two years.""
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said he was not sure of the impact of the tussle, but said corporations are particularly focused on the implications for healthcare. 
A case that could decide the fate of the 2010 Affordable Care Act healthcare law, often called Obamacare, is scheduled to be argued on Nov. 10. 
""We are in the middle of a pandemic and we are not out of the woods yet,"" Kaplan told Reuters in an interview. Business contacts have ""a lot of uncertainty to begin with, because of the pandemic; if you add some more uncertainty, they are sensitive to it, and that's what I've heard today.""

278,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 03:20PM ET</span>",Fed's new zero-rate vow has Kaplan worried on market excesses,"(Reuters) - U.S. Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan said Monday he is ""completely"" on board with keeping interest rates at their current near-zero level even into 2023, but worries a vow to keep them there even longer risks excesses and imbalances in financial markets. 
Last week the Fed promised not to raise rates until the economy reaches full employment and inflation is on track to moderately exceed the Fed's 2% target. 
Kaplan, who dissented, said Monday he believes the economy will be on track for full employment and stable prices by late 2022 or into 2023. 
""I'm a big believer if you make a commitment like this, you need to fulfill it, unless there's an extraordinary reason why you can't,"" Kaplan told Reuters in a phone interview. ""My worry was that this would encourage in the shorter run more risk- taking and maybe create imbalances and instabilities.""
Because technological advances and other forces are putting downward pressure on inflation, promising to delay rate hikes until inflation is headed above 2% could lock the central bank into inaction in the face of such imbalances. 
And if inflation does unexpectedly take off before the labor market has fully healed, the new vow could make it hard for the Fed to react, he said.
Kaplan said he expects that as the economy recovers, the neutral rate - the theoretical level of interest rates at which a healthy economy can chug along - will rise. As that happens, he said, ""if you keep your setting of the fed funds rate exactly where it is, you are actually increasing the level of accommodation."" 
Kaplan said he now expects unemployment to fall to as low as 7.25% this year, and for the economy to shrink less than 3%, far less than his earlier forecasts.
If the economy is approaching 3.5% unemployment, where it was before the coronavirus crisis, but inflation is still a little below 2%, ""I certainly understand why you'd want to maintain a high level of accommodation, but do you actually want to be increasing the level of accommodation? I don't know if you do or don't, and that's the point.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A rebounding stock market and massive federal aid payments pushed the net worth of U.S. households back to pre-coronavirus levels in the second quarter, the Federal Reserve reported on Monday, with savings accounts and equity portfolios both rising sharply despite the pandemic.
The U.S. central bank's latest quarterly look at wealth and income offered further evidence of how the quick mobilization by U.S. lawmakers and the Fed in March and April, including approval of small business loans and $600 per week in extra unemployment insurance, threw a temporary safety net under much of the economy. 
The Fed reported that when the second quarter ended in June, household net worth - the value of homes, stock investments and other assets less what is owed on mortgages and other loans - had hit $118.9 trillion, a $7.6 trillion jump from the prior quarter and above the $118.5 trillion from the last quarter of 2019.
The COVID-19 bear market and rebound: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgpdjnjapo/Pasted%20image%201600705419653.png
That included a $5.7 trillion increase in the value of stocks and mutual funds that had cratered at the start of the pandemic but began to surge as the central bank and Congress approved an extensive array of programs to stave off an economic collapse.
Beginning in late February as COVID-19 began spreading rapidly around the world, the benchmark S&P 500 Index plunged 34% in the space of a month, but rebounded rapidly from its low in late March and fully recovered its losses by mid-August. In the second quarter alone, the index rose 20%, its strongest quarterly increase since 1998.
Wealth also was boosted by a $700 billion increase in savings among households and non-financial businesses, many of which benefited from enhanced unemployment benefits.
That money, tucked away as of the end of June, likely supported retail sales and helped avert a run of bankruptcies and apartment evictions many had expected when the spread of the coronavirus forced much of the U.S. economy to shut down through March and April.
The flow of assistance also helped control household debt levels, which grew at just a 0.5% annualized rate over the quarter, the smallest increase since 2012. 
But the extra spending to battle the pandemic also drove the growth in federal borrowing to historic levels, increasing at a 58.9% annualized rate.
Nonfinancial business debt, by contrast, grew rapidly in the second quarter on the back of the launch of the Payroll Protection Program of loans to small businesses, a rush of bond sales from companies taking advantage of a drop in interest rates and actions the Fed had taken to restore calm to securities markets.
Total business debt rose at a 14% annual rate to $17.56 trillion from $16.96 trillion at the end of the first quarter. Without the PPP, though, the Fed said nonmortgage bank loans to businesses fell sharply, reflecting fewer new loans and companies paying back at least some of the lines of credit that were tapped widely in the first three months of the year.
Corporate bonds outstanding shot up by roughly $425 billion in the quarter to nearly $6.4 trillion.
The data do not speak to what's happening now. Many economists are concerned the expiration of new PPP small business loans and additional unemployment insurance payments authorized as part of the coronavirus-related aid will force people to burn through those extra savings, crimping the economy moving forward.

The nonpartisan agency, in its long-term budget outlook, projected debt will reach 195% of gross domestic product in 2050, up from 98% this year and 79% in 2019. That compares with the prior 2050 forecast of 180% from January, before the coronavirus pandemic struck the nation and spurred Congress to pass about $3 trillion of stimulus.
While low interest rates “indicate that the debt is manageable for now and that fiscal policy could be used to address national priorities,” the budget path is unsustainable over the coming decades and borrowing costs will eventually become an issue, CBO Director Phillip Swagel said in a statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain hopes never to need to use proposed powers to break its Withdrawal Agreement with the European Union, Northern Ireland Office minister Robin Walker said on Monday as the government pressed ahead with legislation to create such powers.
The British government is attempting to pass a bill that would give it the ability to break international law, citing a need to protect trade with Northern Ireland if attempts to negotiate a settlement with the EU prove unsuccessful.
The proposal has enraged Brussels, which has demanded the plan be withdrawn, and has thrown talks on a future relationship with the bloc into chaos.
But Walker said the most contentious parts of the Internal Market Bill were a vital safety net and assured British lawmakers that the powers would be used only if absolutely necessary. 
""We would not take these steps lightly. We would hope it will never be necessary to use these powers and we would only do so if, in our view, the EU was engaged in a material breach of its duties of good faith or other obligations,"" Walker told parliament.
The bill is expected to pass through the lower chamber of parliament next week thanks to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's large majority there. 
Nevertheless, it was subject to fierce criticism from former prime minister Theresa May, a member of Johnson's Conservative Party, who said it undermined peace in Northern Ireland and threatened the integrity of the United Kingdom.
""This will lead to untold damage to the United Kingdom's reputation,"" May said during the debate. ""It puts the future of the United Kingdom at risk and as a result, with regrets, I have to tell the minister I cannot support this bill."" 

Another Conservative lawmaker earlier confirmed that the government had snuffed out a wider rebellion by agreeing to give parliament a vote on whether to use the new powers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday proposed spending $14 billion to shore up a trust fund that pays for airport improvements and air traffic control operations, as well as to extend surface transportation programs.
Earlier this year, Congress agreed to suspend taxes on passenger airline tickets, cargo and fuel for the remainder of 2020. Significantly reduced travel demand because of the coronavirus pandemic and the tax suspension has led to a major shortfall in the Airport and Airway Trust Fund.
The bill also proposes extending surface transportation funding for another year. Congress has struggled for years to find a way to fund highway repairs as gasoline tax revenue has lagged spending. The House bill proposes directing $13.6 billion from the general fund to maintain current spending levels on highways and mass transit.
House Transportation and Infrastructure chairman Peter DeFazio said ""with this one-year extension in place, we can continue work on a long-term, transformational bill.""
Representative Sam Graves, the top Republican on the panel, said the extension provides ""immediate, desperately needed certainty to state DOTs and transportation and construction industry workers.""
On June 15, Reuters and Bloomberg News reported that the Trump administration was preparing an infrastructure package of up to $1 trillion focused on transportation projects as part of its push to spur the world’s largest economy back to life.
After weeks of internal debate, the White House opted not to make the plan public ahead of the November presidential election, sources told Reuters.
In July, the House approved a $1.5 trillion infrastructure package to boost spending on roads, bridges, public transit and rail over 10 years - a plan the White House rejected.
Since 2008, Congress has transferred about $141 billion to the Highway Trust Fund, according to the Government Accountability Office.

Congress has not boosted the 18.4-cents-per-gallon federal gasoline tax since 1993. That tax is now worth just 10.2 cents after adjusting for inflation.

Although Britain left the EU in January, its unfettered access to the bloc for banks and other financial firms does not end until December, when transition arrangements expire.
John Glen, Britain's financial services minister, said on Monday that new Financial Services Bill would create a modern, flexible and robust system of financial regulation.
""(It) will underpin the continued global competitiveness of the UK financial services sector by enhancing its world leading prudential standards, promoting openness to international markets and maintaining the effectiveness of financial services regulatory framework and sound capital markets,"" Glen said.
The reference to world leading prudential standards will reassure regulators in Britain who have cautioned about being given a formal remit to maintain the competitiveness of London as a global financial centre when writing new rules, fearing it would weaken standards.
Christopher Woolard, due to stand down as interim CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority, said the highest international standards and doing what is right for markets were not mutually exclusive.
""Maintaining a strong and robust regulatory and supervisory system, and our commitment to achieving the highest international standards, go hand in hand with the UK's position as a global financial centre,"" Woolard told City Week.
The EU, the City of London's biggest customer, has said it will give UK clearing houses temporary access but will not allow banks in London to offer services directly to customers in the bloc, forcing them to shift activities to new EU hubs.
Glen, speaking at a City Week online event, declined to elaborate on Britain's negotiations with the EU on financial market access, but noted that a sector that pays 75 billion pounds in tax each year was at the centre of the government's efforts to secure trade deals with countries across the world.

Britain is reviewing how it sets financial rules, that for decades were written in Brussels, in order to make the most of leaving the EU, Glen said.

The move by the central bank to solicit input on potential rule changes for the Community Reinvestment Act comes after other U.S. bank regulators already put forward separate rule updates. The Fed is soliciting feedback on how to update the rules to ensure lower-income communities are still supported by banks while reflecting the ways technology has changed banking in recent years.
The proposed rules would expand the act and clarify the aspects of the act that support minority depository institutions, community development financial institutions (CDFIs), women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions, Fed governor Lael Brainard said in remarks prepared for a webinar organized by the Urban Institute on Monday. 

""Given the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color, it is important to support the institutions that have a mission to serve the families, entrepreneurs, and homeowners in these communities,"" Brainard said.

Household net worth increased by $7.6 trillion, or 6.8%, to $119 trillion, while the level of federal government borrowing soared as lawmakers responded with massive fiscal relief, according to a Federal Reserve report out Monday. The gain was the largest in quarterly records back to 1952. The value of equities advanced $5.7 trillion from the prior quarter while real estate increased about $458 billion.
The Covid-19 pandemic and related shutdowns sent the economy into the deepest recession in records dating back to the 1940s, which resulted in a record decline in household net worth in the first quarter. Since then, the economy has seen a gradual, though uneven, recovery. The S&P 500 recovered quickly, hitting pre-pandemic levels by mid-August before surging to fresh highs.
The housing sector has experienced a similar V-shaped rebound as record-low mortgage rates and pent-up demand bolster sales. However, the labor market -- though recovering -- has a long way to go. Not all Americans are benefiting from the rebound in stocks and housing, though. Some 45% of the U.S. population doesn’t own equities, according to a Gallup survey from June 2020, and about one-third of households don’t own a home.
Low interest rates have helped support corporate borrowing amid the pandemic, and the Fed has signaled rates will remain near zero through 2023.
Firms’ debt increased by $594.6 billion from the prior quarter, or at an 14% annualized rate, in the April-June period to a total outstanding $17.6 trillion. Federal debt outstanding ballooned $2.9 trillion, or an annualized 58.9%, to $22.5 trillion.
Consumer credit not including mortgage debt decreased $69 billion in the second quarter, the first drop in at least four years, as the pandemic prompted Americans to cut back on credit-card borrowing. For every $1 in debt owed by households, businesses owed $1.09, the highest ratio since 1989, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

BERLIN/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU governments agreed on Monday on the qualities they want from the next leader of the World Trade Organization, but no longer back the same candidates after Hungary said committed Brexiteer Liam Fox would be one of its picks.
The bloc were united on their choices in the first round of selection as the field was cut from eight to five.
But Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Sunday evening his country would back Fox, a former Conservative trade minister who strongly supported Britain's exit from the European Union, as well as Kenya's Amina Mohamed in round two. 
A number of EU countries, notably France, oppose Fox's candidacy, EU diplomats say.
Earlier on Monday, Fox told a briefing that he was hoping for more EU support. ""I would say that the UK is following exactly the agenda that the EU would have had, had the EU had a candidate in this race, which of course it doesn't.""
His pro-free trade agenda would be beneficial to most European economies, such as Hungary, the 10th most open economy in the world in terms of trade as a percentage of GDP, or two other top 10 nations Luxembourg or Ireland.
German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told a news conference after EU trade ministers met in Berlin that the EU had done well to get three of its picks through - Mohamed, Nigeria's Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and South Korea's Yoo Myung-hee.
He added there was a good chance that an overwhelming majority of EU countries would stick together on the issue.
European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, who now oversees trade at the EU executive, said there was ""strong agreement"" among ministers on Monday that the next WTO director-general should be someone capable of managing profound reform.
""To be credible the new leader of the WTO must enjoy the trust of WTO members and be able to present balanced views that reflect the diverse nature of WTO membership."" 

The WTO has said it wants to select the winning candidate by early November.

Unlike the U.K. and euro area, America is still far away from the chronic forces that have characterized Japanese markets during the past several decades, the New York-based bank said in a note dated Sept. 18. The catalysts are the ultra-loose monetary policies, yet they’re affecting some markets less than others.
The Federal Reserve’s ability to complete a hiking cycle after the great financial crisis built conviction that the U.S. is still some way off from rates that stay low indefinitely, according to the analysis. JPMorgan modeled various bond yield curves across the world, taking into account where the lower bound for interest rates were in each region and their future prospects, and compared them to Japan’s.
“Taking policy rates to zero with strong forward guidance is only a necessary condition in the road to Japanization of the yield curve,” wrote strategists Fabio Bassi and Antoine Gaveau in a note to clients. The U.S. “is furthest away as the market attributes maximum credibility to the Fed in its reflationary exercise,” they said.
One of the characteristics of Japanification is that central banks become an increasingly dominant player. In Japan, there have been days where not a single government bond has traded, and monetary institutions elsewhere are also buying up bigger shares of the market. The European Central Bank’s pandemic stimulus program, for example, scrapped the 33% cap on purchases of the predecessor program.
One of the key questions following the coronavirus crisis is the outlook for inflation across developed markets, given how much stimulus has been pumped into the economy. Currently, traders are far more expectant of prices rising in the U.S. than they are in Japan or Europe.
That phenomenon is also reflected in government bond yields. While Japanese 10-year yields are hovering just above 0% and Germany’s are about 50 basis points below that, the U.S.’s comparable rate is still at around 0.65%.

(Reuters) - At least one American industry is rolling toward a V-shaped recovery.
Wholesale shipments of recreational vehicles - which have surged in popularity as Americans sought to travel without the need to touch hotel or restaurant doorknobs - are projected to set a record next year, according to an analysis seen by Reuters prepared for the RV Industry Association. The report is being released today.
The new analysis estimates shipments could hit 507,200 units. Such an achievement would represent a nearly 20% rise over the report’s new estimate for 2020 and exceed the previous peak of 504,600 units shipped in 2017.
The trade group’s president, Craig Kirby (NYSE:KEX), said in a release that people see RVs “as a way to have the freedom to travel and experience an outdoor lifestyle while also controlling their environment.”
Other outdoor-oriented industries have seen a similar trend. Sales of swimming pools, boats, and all-terrain vehicles have all surged since lockdowns were lifted earlier this year.
The RV industry, centered around Elkhart, Indiana, was largely shut down for two months early in the coronavirus pandemic. But then business roared back. The report’s projection for 2020 is shipments of 424,400 units. That would represent a 4.5% increase over 2019. Some manufacturers are reporting shortages of parts and other supply chain constraints amid the upswing in manufacturing.

The report was prepared for the trade group by an outside consultant, ITR Economics.

The BuzzFeed and other media articles were based on leaked suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed by banks and other financial firms with the U.S. Department of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen). 
A Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) spokeswoman said it was ""aware of relevant news reports but (does) not discuss individual cases"".

IOSCO, made up of financial market watchdogs from the United States, Germany, Britain, France, Japan and other financial centres, on Monday published updated guidance for regulators dealing with conflicts of interest in markets during debt raisings.
Many companies are having to raise debt and equity after suffering a loss of business due to pandemic lockdowns tipped economies into recession.
IOSCO said its members have raised concerns about certain banks putting pressure on their corporate clients to secure future business if the customers subsequently need to raise money via equity or debt.
""These banks are leveraging their lending relationship with issuers to pressure them into using the bank in a future capital raising where issuers may otherwise have not appointed them a role in a transaction,"" IOSCO said.

294,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>",Fed's Kaplan says low rates may be needed for two-and-a-half to three years,"(Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan on Monday said the economy will likely need near-zero interest rates for the next two and a half or three years, but the U.S. central bank shouldn't lock itself into low borrowing costs beyond then.
By 2023, he said, U.S. unemployment will likely have fallen to 4% or 3.5%, from its current 8.4%. 
Once there, he said, ""I probably think it's appropriate to remain accommodative, or maybe even highly accommodative,"" Kaplan said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. ""I'm not sure it's appropriate to decide right now that at that point we should leave rates at zero; I would rather leave those judgments to future committees."" 
The comments were Kaplan's first public remarks since he cast a dissenting vote last week against the Fed's decision to promise low rates until inflation reaches and is on track to ""moderately exceed"" the central bank's 2% goal. 
On Monday, Kaplan said he thought any benefits of the new promise were outweighed by the costs of fueling risk-taking in financial markets, and he appeared to welcome the drop in stock prices since the Fed's announcement. 
The stock market's overall valuation of publicly traded U.S. companies has been high relative to the size of the U.S. economy, he said, and as long as credit spreads don't widen, a stock market correction can be healthy. 
Still, he said, markets likely haven't fully digested the impact of the Fed's new low-rates promise. 

The economy, Kaplan said, is likely growing this quarter at a 30% annual pace and will continue to grow strongly this year and next, assuming some further fiscal stimulus and progress with fighting the coronavirus pandemic, which threw the United States and the world into recession earlier this year.

296,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Investors may shun Indonesian debt over central bank worries,"By Shashwat Awasthi
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Foreign investors are unlikely to rush back into Indonesian markets until either it pays more for its debt or gives hard evidence it will not push the central bank into longer-term monetary financing of public borrowing, fund managers say.
External demand for government debt in Southeast Asia's largest economy, normally prized for 7% yields that are increasingly rare even in the world's emerging markets, has slumped since March with foreign holdings hitting a decade-low in August.
Such inflows are essential for Indonesia as it strives to fund government programmes to combat the coronavirus and restart an economy weakened by months of global and domestic restrictions.
But proposals lodged in parliament this month to increase ministers' influence over Bank Indonesia's (BI) strategy, at a time when it is helping finance emergency government borrowing, have made securing investors' faith more difficult.
The bill is still at an early stage and deliberations may take months. While politicians have played down the threats to the bank's independence, they also say moves in the bill to guarantee it will help buy government debt in emergencies are possible.
""Since the very large outflow we saw post the initial COVID spike... flows have really been very lacklustre in terms of foreign appetite for Indonesian bonds,"" said Stuart Ritson, an emerging market debt portfolio manager at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors.
""Certainly headlines like we've seen over the past few weeks which do question the central bank independence are likely to see investors be more cautious about allocating capital.""
Ratings agency S&P Global told Reuters last week that Indonesia would need to manage the proposed changes carefully to prevent any pressure on its sovereign rating.
Encouraged by the normalisation of central bank bond buying in major economies over the past decade, ratings agencies and investors have given developing world governments more leeway this year on steps that would normally be taboo.
Bank Indonesia is already underpinning some of Jakarta's targeted bond issues.
But longer-term, such schemes carry the risk of drawing governments into additional debt that the International Monetary Fund advises against, worried about the kind of defaults and inflation that have plagued Hungary, Argentina, Ecuador and Lebanon.
To that end, the IMF had last month warned https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/ESR/Issues/2020/07/28/2020-external-sector-report Indonesia to manage its debt as it tackles the pandemic, although its public debt as a percentage of GDP remains way below that of many of its emerging market peers.
""From an economist's perspective, the proposed revision will be unequivocally bad as it would mean approving debt monetization,"" said Toshinobu Chiba, chief fixed income portfolio manager at Nissay Asset Management in Tokyo.
Thanks to years of rebuilding its reputation since a 1990s blow-out, yields on Indonesian 10-year bonds (ID10YT=RR) are well below those in South Africa, Brazil and Turkey.
Chiba said that while he was bullish on Indonesian fixed income, yields would need to rise to levels not seen since early July for him to be comfortable buying in.

""Our position is neutral right now but the 10-year bonds would be attractive if their yield rises to, say, around 7.2%,"" he said.

New forms of consumption have played an important role in driving China's economic recovery, but the development is hampered by inadequate infrastructure, weak service capacity and lagging regulations, the State Council said.
China's retail sales rose 0.5% in August from a year earlier, snapping a seven-month downturn, but still trailing behind expansion in exports and investment, as the economy steadily recovers from a coronavirus-induced slump.
China aims to foster a batch of model cities and leading companies on new types of consumption by 2025 and the share of online retail sales in overall retail sales would show as significant increase, the cabinet said.
China would allow qualified firms in the new consumption sector to raise funds by issuing stocks and bonds, while banks will reduce fees for consumers and firms, the cabinet said.

The government will also promote the close integration of online and offline businesses, and improve infrastructure, including 5G networks and data centres, it said.

The ECB is in the difficult position of trying to keep a lid on the euro while avoiding the impression of starting a currency war or leaving itself open to accusations of exchange rate manipulation, such as those made by U.S. President Donald Trump in recent years.
Four Bundesbank studies published on Monday suggested that the ECB's influence over the exchange rate, including against the U.S. dollar, was large and had increased since the financial crisis, as had volatility on the days when it published its policy decisions.
One of the studies found that the ECB's impact was strongest when its policy brought down long-term rates, estimating that the ECB could weaken the euro by 0.70% against the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and UK sterling by lowering the yield on Germany's five-year government bonds by just 10 basis points.
""This suggests that potential effects on the exchange rate should be taken into account when communicating monetary policy,"" the Bundesbank said.
The ECB was forced into hasty damage limitation earlier this month after President Christine Lagarde sent the euro rallying against the U.S. dollar with a message that investors saw as too timid on the euro's appreciation.

While the currency was eventually reined in, the incident highlighted the market's sensitivity to ECB communication on the euro at a time when the Federal Reserve and all major central banks are also adopting aggressive stimulus policies to cheapen their currencies and navigate the coronavirus pandemic.

300,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday, September 21st","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Stocks are set to tumble on a cocktail of bad news: the virus is surging again in Europe, while the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg threatens to distract lawmakers from the business of passing a fiscal stimulus package. Bank stocks are under pressure after a weekend report alleging massive complicity in processing illicit funds, while Nikola's founder chairman Trevor Milton has stepped down amid allegations of fraud. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, September 21st.
1. FinCEN Files send bank stocks tumbling
Leaked files from the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network showed that dozens of global banks had failed to monitor and prevent trillions of dollars of suspect payments passing through their systems over numerous years.
While much of the detail was largely historical, the dump nonetheless contained previously unpublished material that hit European bank stocks hard on Monday morning.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and ING (AS:INGA) were particularly hard hit, while HSBC not only figured prominently in the leaked files, but was also touted by the Chinese Global Times as being a likely candidate to be put on China’s official list of “unreliable entities”, which would expose it to the risk of damaging sanctions on its business in China.
2. Nikola chairman Milton steps down
Trevor Milton, the founder of electric truck-maker Nikola Corp (NASDAQ:NKLA), stepped down from his position as chairman, in the wake of fraud allegations that are now the subject of an investigation by the Securities and Exchanges Commission.
Milton will be replaced as chairman by Stephen Girsky, formerly vice-chairman of General Motors (NYSE:GM) and a current member of Nikola’s board. The news comes only two weeks after GM agreed to pay $2 billion for a 11% stake in Nikola and said it would partner with the company in making its Badger truck.
Nikola stock fell 28% in premarket trading while GM stock fell 3.9%.
3. WeChat ban halted; TikTok stays Chinese
A federal judge in California blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order that would have shut down the multi-app WeChat platform in the U.S. on first Amendment grounds. The move is a victory for its owner Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY).
The Commerce Department meanwhile suspended the order that would have banned downloads of the video-streaming app TikTok, citing progress on hammering out a deal that would see Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) become minority shareholders in its U.S. operations. Trump said on Saturday he approved such an arrangement.
ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese owner, said it won’t transfer any technology to either company as part of the deal, undermining Trump’s claim that China would have “nothing to do” with TikTok in the U.S.  
4. Stocks set to open sharply lower
U.S. stock markets are set to open sharply lower on Monday, weighed down by a cocktail of news, not least by suspicions that the death of Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the weekend will distract lawmakers from the urgent task of approving a new package of economic support measures.  
Reports that the U.K. is about to impose new restrictions to bring a second wave of the Covid-19 virus under control (see below) were also a factor.
By 6:30 AM ET, Dow futures were down 534 points, or 1.9%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 1.6% and NASDAQ futures were down 1.3%.
While the Nikola news had no direct read-across for the rest of the market, it comes at a time when fears are spreading that tech stock valuations reaching unsustainable levels.
5. U.K. to announce new restrictions to tame virus
The U.K. government is reportedly set to announce new restrictions on public life to stem a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases.
The government’s chief scientific advisor Sir Patrick Vallance told a briefing that the U.K. faces 50,000 new cases a day by mid-October if new measures aren’t put in place now.
Chief medical advisor Andrew Whitty said meanwhile that the country was going “in the wrong direction.”
U.K. media reports suggest the government’s new measures will largely target the hospitality and transport sectors. They look set to frustrate the government’s other objectives of having more people to return to the workplace, and of phasing out the nationwide furlough scheme from October. Sterling fell 0.5% against the dollar in response."

The European Union's banking industry spends around 4 billion euros a year on reporting and lenders often complain that duplication, unnecessary detail and inefficient collection formats make this cost unacceptably high.
Insisting that it wants improve how banks report and not what they report, the ECB called for standardized reporting templates and formats, a central data collection point, the removal of duplications, standardized definitions, and improved data sharing between authorities.
""These efforts should help to reduce the reporting burden for banks and increase the quality of the data received by authorities,"" the ECB said in a statement. ""As a result, banks would be able to reduce costs, and authorities could better monitor developments in the banking industry.""

While there is ""significant scope"" for cutting banks' burden, they are unlikely to get relief anytime soon as changes, to be mandated by the European Banking Authority and in some cases requiring legislation, will ""inevitably be spread over many years,"" the ECB added.

The share of 'home' sovereign debt that domestic banks hold varies greatly from country to country in Europe, S&P added.
In countries like Germany and France, it is typically about 5% and 10% of total private-sector lending. For many other economies, like Spain and Portugal, the ratio is closer to 20%, whilst in some central or eastern European countries the ratio is close to 50%, the ratings agency said.
The 'doom loop' was at the heart of the euro zone debt crisis when banks had huge holdings of their own governments' debt.

305,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>",Powell and Mnuchin Set to Get Grilled on Need for More Stimulus,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are set to be grilled by lawmakers Tuesday on the need for more stimulus to shore up the U.S. economy’s recovery from the coronavirus slump.The focus of the House Financial Services Committee hearing will likely fall on fiscal policy, with time running short for Congress to agree on another round of spending measures before it shuts down ahead of November elections.The $2 trillion bill passed in March has helped production and employment rebound after the steepest drops on record. Its impact is now fading, and lawmakers have been deadlocked for weeks over how much more cash to pump in. Investors are losing faith that a deal will get done this year, one reason why the S&P 500 is currently headed for its first monthly drop since March.
“Failure to pass any additional fiscal measures would likely lead us to downgrade our growth estimates” for the fourth quarter, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economists wrote on Friday.
The Fed, which has cut interest rates to zero and signaled it will keep them there for years, says that monetary stimulus alone won’t be able to sustain the recovery -– and Congress will have to help out. “More fiscal support is likely to be needed,” Powell said last week.Mnuchin also backs another round of spending, identifying restaurants and travel as industries that need help. “Now is not the time to worry about shrinking the deficit,” he told CNBC last week.
The Treasury chief has been a key negotiator in the fiscal standoff. Proposals in Congress range from a $2.2 trillion package backed by Democrats to one worth about $660 billion that’s supported by most Republicans. President Donald Trump has lately indicated he could favor a compromise that roughly splits the difference between those numbers.
Powell and Mnuchin are also due to testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, and the Fed chief will report to a separate House committee on the coronavirus crisis on Wednesday.
Here are some key issues to watch for in the hearings:
Unspent Funds
One potentially thorny issue that Senate Republicans could raise for Powell is the question of whether some of the money earmarked for Fed lending programs should be reallocated.
Since the central bank unleashed a range of facilities in March, backed with funding from the Treasury, liquidity in credit markets has largely been restored. That has reduced the need for borrowing under the programs -- and spurred some Republicans to argue that a portion of the backstop money could now be used elsewhere. Trump has cited a figure of $300 billion.
The Fed’s Main Street lending program, which may come in for special scrutiny in Congress. The $600 billion facility designed to help small-to-mid sized businesses has been criticized for buying just $1.5 billion in loans so far. One reason is the reluctance of banks to lend to the riskier businesses that may need credit the most.
Local Governments
Help for state and local governments, which have been on the front lines in combatting the public health crisis and distributing unemployment benefits, is expected to be another focus for lawmakers in the hearing.
Democrats have been advocating for more money to be sent directly to states and municipalities, which have seen their usual sources of tax revenue dry up. Republicans have generally opposed the idea on the grounds it would bail out mismanaged local authorities.
Meanwhile the Fed’s effort to help local governments, the municipal facility, has only bought two loans to date. Fed officials say it is meant as a backstop in case the market is thrown back into the turmoil it experienced early in the pandemic.
Unemployment Benefits
Unemployment remains at historically high levels even after a recovery in recent months as the economy reopened, with the jobless rate at 8.4% in August. Congress approved a $600-a-week federal top-up for unemployment benefits early in the crisis.Since that measure expired at the end of July, lawmakers have been divided on whether to continue the extra payments. Trump issued an executive order maintaining the benefits at a lower level, but those funds are running out too.
Powell and Mnuchin will likely be pressed for their views on what’s needed next to help the unemployed -- and also for small businesses that are still struggling. The government’s Paycheck Protection Program, which bailed them out with grants and loans, is now closed.

306,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2020 04:40AM ET</span>","Norway rates seen on hold at zero, but outlook may change - Reuters poll","By Terje Solsvik
OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's central bank is expected to keep its key interest rate at a record low zero percent this week, a Reuters poll found on Monday, leaving many economists to focus on any potential shift in the policy outlook.
The 33 participants in the poll were unanimous in predicting no change in rates when the outcome is announced on Sept. 24, in line with the central bank's stated view.
Fearing a collapse of the economy amid the coronavirus outbreak, Norges Bank slashed its policy rate three times this year from 1.5% to zero, and said in May that rates could stay at that level until the end of 2023.
But only a few weeks later, in June, the central bank lifted its outlook for growth and said a rate hike could come in 2022 instead, and some economists now say the monetary policy committee may again alter its forecast.
""We think that the Norges Bank will bring forward the projected start date of policy tightening ... from mid-2022 at present perhaps to mid-2021,"" Capital Economics wrote on Sept. 17.
This could make Norges Bank among the first in the world to tighten policy after the coronavirus outbreak, Capital Economics noted.
Statistics Norway also recently said it expected rates to begin rising in mid-2021, albeit at a slow pace, as the impact on the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic was somewhat less severe than first thought.
DNB Markets predicted, however, that Norges Bank would stick to its 2022 plan, as set out in June, amid a recent rise in coronavirus infections.

Norges Bank is likely, however, to express concern about the fact that inflation is running above target and that housing prices are rising faster than expected, economists said.

Current finance ministry forecasts foresee public debt reaching 75% of gross domestic product by the end of 2021.

""Global economic recovery from the depths of the COVID-19 plunge this past winter and spring has proceeded significantly faster than we envisioned,"" Peter Hooper, Deutsche global head of economic research wrote in a note to clients. 
""As Q3 draws toward a close, we estimate that the level of global GDP is about half way back to its pre-virus level, and we now see that journey being completed by the middle of next year, a couple quarters sooner than in our previous forecast.""
Deutsche raised its forecast for global GDP, expecting it to shrink 3.9% this year after predicting in May a contraction of 5.9% for 2020. For 2021, Deutsche raised its growth forecast to 5.6% from 5.3%.
Yet there was also a lot of uncertainty and potential trouble ahead, Hooper added. 
Fears over second infection waves gathering momentum in the United States and Europe had increased uncertainty over the economic outlook, with the U.S. election that was ""too close to call"" adding to the mix. Meanwhile, in Europe a hard Brexit shock was a risk, Deutsche said. 
And a shift in monetary policy - though some years away - could spell further trouble. 
""The expansion of debt and potential overvaluation of assets that has been fed by necessarily super easy monetary policy poses the serious risk of a looming global financial crisis as central banks begin to shift away from easy policy,"" Hooper wrote. ""Any upward surprises to inflation would heighten this risk.""

MADRID (Reuters) - After securing a generous portion of European Union recovery funds for the coronavirus crisis, Spain faces an unlikely problem -- how to make use of all the money, government sources told Reuters.
""This is not a crisis of dough (money), it is a crisis of ideas,"" one of the sources said, referring to concrete investment projects to help the economy out of a record recession. 
In a country that has not managed to approve a full-year budget since 2016 because of a prolonged political paralysis, the need to suddenly absorb extra cash is a challenge, said the sources.
Spain has been hit particularly badly by the pandemic. It has recorded more than 640,000 COVID-19 cases, the highest number in Western Europe, and the disease has killed more than 30,000.
The economy slumped 18.5% in the second quarter, a contraction exceeded in Europe only by Britain. 
To help Spain recover, it will receive around 140 billion euros ($166 billion) in grants and loans out of the EU 750-billion-euro coronavirus recovery package. 
That includes 43 billion euros in grants in the next two years alone - equivalent to about 8% of annual expenditure.
""Spending that money is not easy,"" a second government source said. Four sources close to the management of the funds said there were concerns and some anxiety about how to set up the machinery to take on this amount of liquidity. 
Another source with direct knowledge of the management of the funds said the main projects to receive the funds had already been earmarked and that Spain would certainly comply with deadlines and requirements imposed by Brussels.
SANCHEZ'S OFFICE SUPERVISING IMPLEMENTATION
The European Commission has recommended EU governments spend money from the recovery package on green energy, transport and investment in digitalisation.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who fought hard at an EU summit in July for the recovery fund to be approved, has put his office in charge of supervising the implementation of the recovery plan, with an advisory group made up of corporate executives to be set up, another source said.
Economy Minister Nadia Calvino is also closely involved as she is finalising a reform plan to be presented to Brussels by Oct. 15, which must outline the main projects eligible for the EU money.
""Right now the challenge is how the money that arrives will be fully applied, and there will have to be projects with a lot of absorption (investment take-up),"" said Jose Moises Martin, director of Red2Red consultancy that caters to public authorities. 
Aside from the recovery funds, Brussels has approved a 21 billion euro soft loan for Spain to finance employment support schemes, which should alleviate pressure on the Treasury, which has been borrowing for months for this purpose.
A source close to the budget ministry said revenues had recently been better than expected, and September debt issuance has slowed down from the previous months.
But on Wednesday the central bank cut its 2021 growth forecast to 4.1%-7.3%.
Its chief economist, Oscar Arce, said that under the best-case scenario, EU funds could boost medium-term GDP growth by two percentage points, but success would hinge on choosing the right investment projects.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank is likely to keep interest rates steady at record lows and hold off on further stimulus this week, even as the economy faces a deep recession, on signs the fallout from coronavirus pandemic could be milder than expected.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will keep the official cash rate (OCR) unchanged at 0.25% on Wednesday for a fourth consecutive meeting, according to all 11 economists polled by Reuters. The economists said they expected rates to remain steady for the rest of the year.
New Zealand fell into its deepest economic recession on record in the second quarter, data showed last week, but the 12.2% quarter-on-quarter contraction was smaller than the 12.8% decline forecast in a Reuters poll.
Meanwhile, Treasury forecasts showed a milder short-term shock from the coronavirus outbreak, while house prices have defied forecasts and stayed buoyant.
""The recent period of stronger data means the RBNZ won't see any need to loosen monetary policy further at this stage,"" said Westpac Chief Economist Dominick Stephens.
About 97% of the market expects no change in rates this week, but have priced in a move close to zero by April next year, according to Eikon.
In the Reuters poll, three of the 11 economists expected a rate cut in the first quarter of next year and seven expected rates to enter negative territory in Q2 2021.
The RBNZ has held rates steady since cutting them by 75 basis points at an emergency meeting in March.
But in August the central bank expanded its bond-buying programme to NZ$100 billion ($67.7 billion) and struck a dovish tone. 
It reiterated its commitment to holding rates until March next year, and said it would consider negative rates and low-cost funding to banks if further stimulus was needed.
On Wednesday, the markets will focus on whether there's any change to this forward guidance, ANZ Bank said in a note.
""For the short end, any weakening of the commitment to keep the OCR unchanged until March would certainly cause a flurry of excitement, but this is not our expectation,"" said ANZ Chief Economist Sharon Zollner.

The one-year loan prime rate (LPR)  was kept unchanged at 3.85%, while the five-year LPR  remained at 4.65%.
Most new and outstanding loans are based on the LPR, while the five-year rate influences the pricing of mortgages.
Thirty-one out of 35 traders and analysts, or nearly 90%, in a snap Reuters poll conducted last week saw no change to either the one-year or the five-year LPR.
The rate decision came after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) kept the borrowing cost on medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans unchanged for the fifth straight month.
MLF, one of the PBOC's main tools in managing longer-term liquidity in the banking system, serves as a guide for the LPR.
Recent economic data showed that the world's second-largest economy has steadily recovered from a virus-induced slump, but analysts say policymakers face a tough job sustaining stable expansion over the next few years.
China's economy remains resilient and there are ample policy tools at Beijing's disposal, despite rising external risks, President Xi Jinping said in remarks published on Saturday.

The LPR is a lending reference rate set monthly by 18 banks. The PBOC revamped the mechanism to price LPR in August 2019, loosely pegging it to the MLF rate.

Forecasters warned on Sunday that coastal communities could be inundated with floods and see sustained winds of 60 miles per hour (95 km per hour), though the storm is expected to weaken as it moves inland. 
Slow-moving storms that deluge coasts are becoming a regular occurrence, a development that scientists attribute to climate change. 
This month marks only the second time in history that the sheer number of storms has forced forecasters to turn to the Greek alphabet for names, having exhausted their alphabetical list of names selected before the season began. The first year that storms exceeded given names was 2005, when there were a record 27 named storms.
Beta is the third named storm in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in less than a month, following Laura and Sally. 
Oil and gas producers had been restarting their offshore operations over the weekend after being disrupted by Sally. As Beta neared, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) halted some oil production and began evacuating workers from a platform in the Gulf.
Slow-moving Beta could drop between 8 and 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) of rain through Thursday, with up to 20 inches in some isolated areas, the NHC said, warning residents to beware flash flooding.
Forecasters were also tracking Hurricane Teddy in the Atlantic Ocean as it headed toward Bermuda, where it was due to arrive Sunday night before heading north to Nova Scotia for Wednesday. The storm is large, with hurricane-force winds extending 80 miles (135 km) from its center, and could cause dangerous rip currents along beaches on the U.S. East Coast, the NHC said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - For four decades Indian Nobel peace laureate Kailash Satyarthi rescued thousands of children from the scourge of slavery and trafficking but he fears all his efforts could reverse as the coronavirus pandemic forces children into labour.
""The biggest threat is that millions of children may fall back into slavery, trafficking, child labour, child marriage,"" said Satyarthi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 for his work to combat child labour and child trafficking in India.
As the pandemic pummels the Indian economy, pushing millions of people into poverty, families are under pressure to put their children to work to make ends meet.
While rates of child labour have declined over the last few years, about 10.1 million children are still in some form of servitude in India, according to the United Nations children's agency UNICEF.
Across India child labourers can be found in a variety of industries such as brick kilns, carpet-weaving, garment-making, domestic service, agriculture, fisheries and mining. 
Earlier this month, Satyarthi's organisation backed by police rescued dozens of girls during a raid on a shrimp processing unit in western India.
""Once children fall into that trap they could be pulled into prostitution and could be trafficked easily ... this is another danger which government have to address now,"" he said, adding that he believed sexual abuse of children was also on the rise due to the pandemic.

""I cannot be satisfied even if one single child is enslaved ... it means there is something wrong in our polity, in our economy, in our society, we have to ensure that not a single child is left out,"" he told Reuters.

314,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2020 06:00PM ET</span>","'FinCEN' documents reportedly show banks moved illicit funds - BuzzFeed, ICIJ","(Reuters) - Several global banks moved large sums of allegedly illicit funds over a period of nearly two decades, despite red flags about the origins of the money, BuzzFeed and other media reported on Sunday, citing confidential documents submitted by banks to the U.S. government.
The media reports were based on leaked suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed by banks and other financial firms with the U.S. Department of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen).
The SARs, which the reports said numbered more than 2,100, were obtained by BuzzFeed News and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and other media organizations.
In all, the ICIJ reported that the files contained information about more than $2 trillion worth of transactions between 1999 and 2017, which were flagged by internal compliance departments of financial institutions as suspicious. The SARs are in themselves not necessarily proof of wrongdoing, and the ICIJ reported the leaked documents were a tiny fraction of the reports filed with FinCEN.
Five global banks appeared most often in the documents —  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn),  Standard Chartered  Plc (L:STAN) and Bank of New York Mellon Corp (N:BK), the ICIJ reported. The SARs provide key intelligence in global efforts to stop money laundering and other crimes. The media reports on Sunday painted a picture of a system that is both under-resourced and overwhelmed, allowing vast amounts of illicit funds to move through the banking system.
A bank has a maximum of 60 days to file SARs after the date of initial detection of a reportable transaction, according to the Treasury Department's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The ICIJ report said in some cases the banks failed to report suspect transactions until years after they had processed them.
The SARs also showed that banks often moved funds for companies that were registered in offshore havens, such as the British Virgin Islands, and did not know the ultimate owner of the account, the report said. Staff at major banks often used Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches to learn who was behind large transactions, it said.
Among the types of transactions highlighted by the report: funds processed by JPMorgan for potentially corrupt individuals and companies in Venezuela, Ukraine and Malaysia; money from a Ponzi scheme moving through HSBC; and money linked to a Ukrainian billionaire processed by Deutsche Bank.
""I hope these findings spur urgent action from policymakers to enact needed reforms,"" said Tim Adams, chief executive of the trade group Institute of International Finance, in a statement. ""As noted in today's reports, the impacts of financial crime are felt beyond just the financial sector – it poses grave threats to society as a whole.""
In a statement to Reuters, HSBC said ""all of the information provided by the ICIJ is historical."" The bank said as of 2012, ""HSBC embarked on a multi-year journey to overhaul its ability to combat financial crime across more than 60 jurisdictions.""
Standard Chartered said in a statement to Reuters, ""We take our responsibility to fight financial crime extremely seriously and have invested substantially in our compliance programmes.""
BNY Mellon told Reuters it could not comment on specific SARs. ""We fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and assist authorities in the important work they do,"" the bank said.
JPMorgan said it has ""thousands of people and hundreds of millions of dollars dedicated to this important work."" ""We have played a leadership role in anti-money laundering reform,"" the bank said in a statement.
In a statement on Sunday, Deutsche Bank said the ICIJ had ""reported on a number of historic issues."" ""We have devoted significant resources to strengthening our controls and we are very focused on meeting our responsibilities and obligations,"" the bank said.
FinCen said in a statement on its website on Sept. 1 that it was aware that various media outlets intended to publish a series of articles based on unlawfully disclosed SARs, as well as other documents, and said that the ""unauthorized disclosure of SARs is a crime that can impact the national security of the United States.""

Representatives for the U.S. Treasury declined comment beyond the FinCen statement.

The Verdi and dbb unions want a 4.8% pay rise for 2.3 million public sector workers in federal government and municipalities in Europe's biggest economy.
""Employers have blocked themselves into a corner ... so warning strikes are inevitable,"" said Verdi chairman Frank Werneke.

The unions said they would make sure the public were aware of any restrictions in nurseries, hospitals, road maintenance or other areas because of walkouts.
The government has said that the coronavirus crisis is pushing down tax revenue and is limiting its public sector finances, especially at the municipal level.
Unions, however, argue that public sector workers, particularly in the health sector, have played a crucial role in the pandemic and this should be reflected in wage talks.
Further negotiations are scheduled for Oct. 22-23.

The European Central Bank, meanwhile, is keeping a close eye on German wage negotiations for any sign that wage growth and might be losing steam, potentially complicating its inflation targets.

Keen to avoid bankruptcies and mass layoffs, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has launched a range of stimulus and relief measures as Germany braces for its biggest slump since World War Two, having shrunk by an unprecedented 9.7% in the second quarter. 
""Companies that can show creditors a realistic prospect of restructuring should be able to implement their concept outside insolvency proceedings,"" said Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht in a statement.
Under the draft reform, which would take effect at the start of 2021, the deadline for firms to file for insolvency would be extended to six from three weeks and authorities will apply more relaxed benchmarks when examining over-indebtedness.
The government has already taken steps such as allowing firms in financial trouble due to the pandemic to delay filing for bankruptcy until the end of the year, extending an original deadline of the end of September.
Helped by these measures, the number of firms declaring insolvency in Germany fell 6.2% to 9,006 in the first half of this year from the same period last year. Critics say suspending insolvencies delays, but does not prevent, the collapse of ""zombie companies"" artificially kept afloat.

However, defenders of insolvency protection steps say they have helped to spare Germany deeper economic contraction and prevent a spike in unemployment.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary will extend a moratorium on loan repayments for some households and companies until the middle of 2021, as its finance minister warned the economy could struggle to grow next year unless a coronavirus vaccine is found.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban introduced the moratorium for all companies and private borrowers in March as one of his government's key measures to help reduce the economic fallout from the pandemic. It was due to expire at the end of the year.
In a video posted on his official Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page on Saturday, Orban said the moratorium would be extended by six months for families with children, the retired, unemployed and those in public works programmes.
The extension until the middle of 2021 will also apply to companies that have seen revenues drop by at least 25%.
Orban also said loan contracts for all households and companies agreed before the pandemic could not be terminated for six months.
The moves come as the government prepares to announce more steps to try to revive growth, after the economy plunged more than expected in the second quarter and prospects for a recovery next year have worsened.
The weak economic outlook could represent the biggest threat to nationalist Orban's decade-long rule as he prepares to face parliamentary elections in the first half of 2022. 
Finance minister Mihaly Varga said in an interview published earlier on Saturday that if a coronavirus vaccine was not available by the middle of 2021 the economy might struggle to grow next year, based on a pessimistic scenario. 
Under an optimistic scenario, the economy could grow by 4-5% if a vaccine was available in the second quarter, he told newspaper Magyar Nemzet. 
A third scenario was for a protracted recovery with 3%-4% growth, also conditional on a vaccine being available, he added.
Hungary's economy is expected to shrink by 5%-6% this year.
Varga said the government was working on new stimulus measures that could include targeted tax cuts for crisis-hit sectors. 

After a spike in new cases in recent weeks, Hungary reported 809 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, bringing the total to 16,920, with 675 deaths.

U.S Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin signed the agreement with Indonesia's Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati remotely on Friday, according to a statement posted on the U.S. Treasury Department's website.
Rahayu Puspasari, spokeswoman for Indonesia's Finance Ministry, said in a separate statement that the agreement would bolster the development of capital markets and financial instruments to ""facilitate and reduce the barriers to private sector investment in infrastructure."" 
Puspasari added that the agreement would help improve asset recycling capacity, impact assessment for the financing already given, and credit enhancement.

""The engagement supports the broader U.S. Government Indo-Pacific Strategy by complementing ongoing efforts under the Enhancing Development and Growth through Energy (Asia EDGE) and the Infrastructure Transaction and Assistance Network (ITAN),"" said the U.S. Treasury Department.

After President Donald Trump's administration imposed additional tariffs on Chinese goods and curbs on Huawei Technologies Co last year, China vowed to draw up a list aimed at punishing foreign firms deemed harmful to Chinese interests.
It has yet to publish the list.
The United States said on Friday it will ban WeChat and video-sharing app TikTok from U.S. stores starting on Sunday night, a move that will block Americans from downloading the Chinese-owned platforms over concerns they pose a national security threat.
China's list will target foreign firms and individuals violating normal market transactions in China, interrupting deals with Chinese firms or taking discriminatory measures against Chinese firms, the ministry said.
In May, state-run tabloid Global Times reported the measures would target such U.S. companies as Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO),  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM), while suspending purchases of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) airplanes.
The ministry said the list will help ""safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, maintain a fair and free international economic and trade order, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises, other organizations or individuals.""
Authorities will set up a working mechanism and an office to help implement work related to the list, it added.
China will prohibit foreign firms listed as unreliable entities from engaging in import, export and investment in China, the ministry said.
Foreign firms could be removed from the list if they correct their behaviours and takes steps to eliminate the consequences of their actions, it said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore police are looking into a complaint from Ernst & Young that a firm owned by bidders for soccer club Newcastle United allegedly used the auditor's unauthorized signatures on financial statements.
The investigation is the latest scrutiny of Singaporean business duo Terence and Nelson Loh since Reuters reported their other firm behind the Newcastle bid doctored photos of Barack Obama and made other suspect claims in marketing materials.
The police report lodged this week relates to the financial statements of Cayman Islands incorporated Novena Global Healthcare Group, which Singapore's Straits Times newspaper reported is owned by the Loh cousins.
A spokeswoman for Ernst & Young said it was ""never the auditors"" of the Cayman Islands parent firm, and worked for a Singapore-based subsidiary only in 2017.
Police said they had received the complaint and were looking into the matter.
Neither of the Lohs - thrust into the spotlight last month as the co-founders of the newly-formed Bellagraph Nova Group which claimed to be in advanced talks to buy one of England's most high-profile clubs - responded to a request for comment.
A lawyer speaking on behalf of Terence Loh told the Straits Times that he was aware of the allegations but denied wrongdoing.
After the Reuters report, various other inconsistencies surfaced in BN Group's claims made on its website, press releases and social media posts, which it said ""appears to be the result of the actions of certain errant individuals"".
Meanwhile people and businesses linked to the group started to distance themselves, while Singapore's Business Times newspaper reported some regional investors were trying to withdraw investments from the group's entities.
Singapore's corporate regulator ACRA has also said it is taking enforcement action on two other companies linked to the Lohs for not filing annual returns.

(Reuters) - This week's economic data offers fresh hints that the U.S. recovery will slow without new federal aid, a possible blow to President Donald Trump's reelection bid, especially since any new spending before the Nov. 3 presidential election seems unlikely.
A slowdown in U.S. consumer spending in August provided the clearest evidence this week that as millions of Americans lost the extra unemployment benefits that had sustained their finances in the early months of the COVID-19 recession, they have begun to cut back.
For a graphic on A rebound, and then sideways? A rebound, and then sideways?
https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ECONOMY-RETAILSALES/ygdvzkyeypw/chart.png
In an economy where consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the total output, less shopping means less overall growth.
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment dropped less than expected, and applications for the week before were revised up, suggesting the labor market recovery has plateaued.
For a graphic on Jobless claims still elevated:
https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ECONOMY-JOBLESS/azgponxegvd/chart.png
Meanwhile, a Fed survey released Friday showed that American households were better off financially in July than they were in the first months of the crisis, in large part because of their access to government aid.
Other data this week indicate the recovery is ongoing in some parts of the economy.
U.S. factory production increased for a fourth straight month in August, and confidence rose to a record among single-family homebuilders, who saw a boost to demand from low interest rates and pandemic-fueled demand for homes suited to remote work.
Broad consumer sentiment also picked up in September, a report showed Friday. Democrats grew more upbeat about the economy's outlook while Republicans' enthusiasm dipped, but overall consumer optimism is still down compared with before the crisis.
STIMULUS IS COMING, EVENTUALLY
Next week Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to address lawmakers at three separate hearings, where he will undoubtedly make the same observation he has repeatedly made for months, including after this week's policymaking meeting: more stimulus ""is likely to be needed"" for the recovery to continue.
The House, controlled by Democrats, and the Senate, controlled by Republicans, are deadlocked on any stimulus bill, and there's little chance of it passing before the election.
Eventually, Congress will pass some pandemic relief, no matter who wins the presidential contest. But it's likely to be less under Trump, a Republican, than under Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
""If Trump wins and (Republicans) retain control of the Senate and the president says he wants more stimulus, Republicans will find a way to go along with that,"" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB). ""If Biden wins, you would get bigger stimulus.""
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economists said they would likely boost their fourth-quarter GDP forecast if Biden wins and Democrats retake the U.S. Senate, because Democrats would approve a spending package larger than the $1 trillion Goldman has penciled in.
VOTERS FOCUSED ON VIRUS
Despite overall concerns about the strength of the recovery, and millions out of work since the pandemic hit, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjvqnkqrpx/Topline%20Reuters%20General%20Election%20Tracker%2009%2015%202020.pdf found that 45% of U.S. adults think Trump is the better candidate for rebuilding the economy. That's compared with 36% who say Biden would be better.
But the same poll showed that likely voters were much more concerned about a candidate's ability to fight the coronavirus and restore trust in government, both issues on which voters gave Biden a lead.

COVID-19 has killed more than 197,000 in the United States since the pandemic began. New daily cases are now averaging about 40,000, about 60% of the July peak.

326,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 04:15PM ET</span>",Fed's new framework met with a confused shrug by the public: survey,"By Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve hopes a new strategy rolled out last month will sink deep into the minds of the U.S. public, be well understood to involve higher inflation in the future, and prompt people to act accordingly.
Will it?
""No, no and no,"" comes the answer from research https://www.fedinprint.org/item/fedcwq/88730/original published Friday by the Cleveland Fed that conducted randomized surveys the day before, the day of, and the day after a high-profile speech delivered by Fed Chair Jerome Powell describing the central bank's move to ""average inflation targeting.""
""Powell’s speech apparently did not reach or register with the vast majority of the population,"" wrote the research team including University of Texas at Austin professor Olivier Coibion and University of California, Berkeley professor Yuriy Gorodnichenko.
""Even for those who heard news about monetary policy following the announcement, the news had little impact,"" and left their views about the Fed and inflation ""effectively unchanged ... This suggests (the new strategy) is unlikely to provide many of the economic benefits that theory often attributes to it.""
The research addresses a problem Fed officials knew could bedevil them as they debated whether to move to a new approach that would allow periods of high inflation to offset the last decade of weak prices. Considered optimal in theory as something that could shift people's expectations and cause them to behave in ways that actually produce higher inflation, selling the idea to the public and investors is a different matter. 
Many on Wall Street are already taking the Fed's new strategy with a grain of salt, with contracts tied to future inflation showing little change since the Fed's announcement. 
To survey respondents in the public at large, it barely registered, with a peak of one third of the respondents polled the day after Powell's speech saying they had heard news, and no significant change in perceptions of inflation or household spending plans.
The survey also revealed broad misunderstanding of the central bank's aims. Though its legal ""mandate"" and the focus of hundreds of speeches a year is to guarantee maximum employment and stable prices, more respondents said the Fed was in business to ensure a strong dollar and keep borrowing costs cheap for the federal government - two things the Fed says it explicitly doesn't try to do.

""While the 'Fed Listens,' the public may not,"" the authors jibed in a play on the public tour the central bank conducted around the country last year.

327,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",Fed's Kashkari says pandemic aid was also 'banking bailout',"(Reuters) - U.S. banks got their second bailout in little more than a decade when Congress cut checks to millions of Americans to help them through the coronavirus crisis, Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari said on Friday, calling for a new round of reforms to prevent it from happening again. 
""I applaud Congress’ bold actions to support people affected by the COVID-19 crisis, but we need to be clear that families weren’t the only beneficiaries,"" Kashkari said in remarks prepared for delivery to a Council of Institutional Investors conference. But banking losses, he said, would have been much larger had Americans not had that extra cash to spend. 
""This was also a banking bailout,"" he told the group.
Most Fed officials including Fed Chair Jerome Powell say the current recession is very different from the last one, which was caused by excess risk-taking by banks and other financial institutions. 
Banks, Powell and others have said, have softened the blow of the pandemic by drawing on capital buffers built up since the last crisis to support households and businesses in this one. 
Kashkari's take is different. Why, he asked, should banks be allowed to rely on overnight funding markets? Those have proven fragile, he said.
""The primary value I see is that it allows firms to eke out a few extra basis points of earnings in good times and then requires the central bank to backstop it when risks emerge,"" he said. ""With smart, aggressive regulation, the American economy could thrive on an efficient, competitive, and innovative financial system that was more resilient against shocks—one that required taxpayers to step in far less often and at lower cost.""
Laws and rules passed since the 2007-2009 crisis have forced banks to increase the capital they have on hand against losses, but Kashkari has urged even higher requirements. 

Kashkari's views often differ from his colleagues, including this week when he dissented on a rate-setting decision.

PENSACOLA BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Hurricane Sally made a direct hit on the U.S. Gulf Coast this week, dealing a blow to a popular tourist destination already reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. In the storm's aftermath, many bar and restaurant owners were breathing a sigh of relief the damage was not worse. 
Sally bulled its way through this stretch of beach towns and condos in Alabama and Florida, making landfall on Wednesday as a powerful Category 2 hurricane and bringing extensive floods that destroyed numerous piers and caused two riverboat casinos under construction to break free of their moorings.
Max Murphy, general manager of Crabs, a seafood and steak restaurant in Pensacola Beach, Florida, said the hurricane's late eastward turn left residents unprepared. 
""Everyone in the community expected it to keep going straight west to New Orleans or Gulfport (Miss.), but it took that turn so we weren't really prepared,"" Murphy said. ""I didn't even get the plywood up on my windows, because I wasn’t expecting it to come here."" 
The damage from Hurricane Sally could range from $8 billion to $10 billion, well above earlier estimates of $2 billion to $3 billion, said Chuck Watson of Enki Research, which tracks tropical storms and models the costs of their damage. The hit to tourism revenues may not be fully known for months.
The U.S. leisure and hospitality industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed nearly 200,000 Americans. The Gulf region is a popular driving destination for the entire Southeast and Texas, peppered with restaurants, casinos and amusement parks. 
Baldwin County, Alabama, where the hurricane made landfall, was the state's most-visited county in 2019, according to the state tourism bureau, bringing in $1.7 billion in travel-related revenue. 
In the Pensacola region, approximately 22,900 people were employed in that industry in August, a 13% drop from March, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
After seeing a big drop in business this spring due to COVID-19 lockdowns, tourism in the Florida panhandle was ""on the path to recovery"" prior to Sally, with hotel occupancy as strong as in 2019, said Tarik Dogru, assistant professor of hospitality management at Florida State University, who expects Sally's impact to be relatively short-lived.
Mike Bose, a manager at the Flora-Bama beach bar in Perdido Key, Florida, which hugs the Alabama state line, said the damage was still being assessed. More than 24 hours after the storm made landfall, parts of the restaurant were still flooded. 
""We got quite a bit of water damage throughout, which we're working on today,"" Bose said. ""There's no telling at this point what the cost is to get back on track."" 
Some tourists and visitors say the hurricane has scared them away from a return visit. Toni Galloway from Kansas City, Missouri, was visiting the Gulf area when Sally struck.
""This was my first hurricane. I wouldn't want to weather another one. It's frightening. I will have to think long and hard about returning to the Gulf Coast,"" she said.
Murphy, the Crabs general manager, said the damage from this hurricane was less extensive than others like Hurricane Ivan, which hit 16 years ago at Category 5 strength. ""That's enough damage for the season. We don't want anymore. We got lucky, we really did.""
John Perkins, 71, got to Gulf Shores, Alabama, on Sunday night from Tennessee to attend a wedding. Instead, he found himself hunkering down with his wife as the winds blew for hours.

""I told my wife - we can mark this off our bucket list. We rode out a hurricane,"" he said.

The new guidance appears to be an attempt to address crossed signals from bank regulators that have been contributing to a limited uptake of the program, which is designed to offer credit to small and mid-sized businesses that need capital to survive the downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The U.S. central bank emphasized the new guidance was developed with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, two of the primary U.S. bank regulators.

The new guidance states: ""Supervisors will not criticize Eligible Lenders for originating Main Street loans in accordance with the Program's requirements, including cases when such loans are considered non-pass at the time of origination, provided these weaknesses stem from the pandemic and are expected to be temporary or if such loans are part of a bank's prudent risk mitigation strategy for an existing borrower.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Agriculture Department on Friday released details of a second round of COVID-19 aid for farmers, which will pay up to $14 billion to growers of major crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat, as well as livestock, dairy and tobacco. 
President Donald Trump announced the assistance on Thursday night at a campaign rally in Wisconsin, a crucial battleground state.
Farmers widely backed Trump in 2016.
The aid follows a $19 billion relief program announced in April to help U.S. farmers cope with disruptions to the food supply chain and plummeting demand from restaurants during the pandemic. Less than $10 billion has been paid out to date. 
""We listened to feedback received from farmers, ranchers and agricultural organizations about the impact of the pandemic on our nations' farms and ranches, and we developed a program to better meet the needs of those impacted,"" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement.
The administration has been criticized for the $28 billion spent over 2018 and 2019 to compensate farmers for lost sales during a tariff war with China.
""Once again, the Trump administration is funneling too much money to farmers that do not need it and not enough to those that are facing economic ruin,"" said Scott Faber, senior vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group. ""The only plausible explanation is that this is just old-fashioned vote buying.""
The new aid package will largely be funded by the Commodity Credit Corp, a Depression-era program created to support farm income. Funds from the corporation do not need to be approved by Congress.
The USDA also said that up to $100 million in aid for tobacco farmers will come from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.
In North Carolina, the top tobacco-producing state, Republican Senator Thom Tillis, in a statement, thanked Trump and Perdue for helping farmers in his state.
Tillis trails his Democratic challenger, former state Senator Cal Cunningham, who has also steadily outraised him in campaign donations.
BILLIONS FOR CORN, SOY
Based on the government's latest harvest projections, farmers could receive about 23 cents a bushel for corn, or $3.427 billion, and 31 cents a bushel for soybeans, or $1.337 billion, according to a Reuters analysis of figures from the USDA and the American Farm Bureau Federation. The program also allows farmers to apply for aid at $15 per acre for major row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
The USDA said that major row crops were eligible for the program because the national average price for them fell at least 5% between mid-January and late July. 
Prices have rallied sharply since then, with a surge in buying from China pushing the soybean futures market  to its highest in more than two years. Corn (Cv1) was trading at its highest in more than six months and wheat  recently hit a five-month top. 
The new plan adds nearly 100 specialty crops like honey, ginger and macadamia nuts. It also eases restrictions on aid for such crops that farmers said limited the benefits of the previous payment program.
Hog farmers will be paid $23 per pig, after receiving about $1.6 billion in the first round, according to the National Pork Producers Council. The industry group said pig farmers still need more aid.
Some 20 meat plants closed in April due to COVID-19 outbreaks among workers, backing up livestock on farms and prompting some producers to euthanize pigs.

""All hog farmers are hurting as a result of the COVID pandemic and additional federal assistance is urgently needed to preserve the livelihoods of thousands of American hog farmers,"" the National Pork Producers Council said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The ""pernicious and persistent"" impact of long-outlawed policies like ""redlining"" Blacks out of white neighborhoods continues to influence the ability of minority families to amass wealth, and requires a deeper look at how those longstanding problems might be addressed, Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said on Friday.
Even as laws have moved forward to forbid discriminatory practices, ""progress has been incremental"" with the median white household today holding 10 times the assets of a similar Black household, Bostic said in webcast remarks to a conference on Racial Justice and Finance hosted by the Atlanta Fed and Princeton University. ""This ratio is not much changed from what it was more than 100 years ago.""
""Something more fundamental must happen,"" Bostic said, encouraging researchers and policymakers to ""look 'under the hood' at our institutions to see and truly understand their design and its implications...We can then find more creative and accurate ways to incorporate race into our models"" and ""truly create meaningful and lasting change."" 
He did not offer specific policy suggestions, but noted how the exclusion of farm and domestic workers from Depression-era social insurance programs excluded a disproportionate number of Blacks from benefits, while both redlining and other housing policies undermined the accumulation of wealth.
That, and other policies, have compounded over time into a persistent wealth gap.
Bostic, the first Black named president of one of the Fed's 12 regional banks, has been among the most outspoken Fed officials in an evolving conversation at the central bank about economic inequality.

Overall, 77% of consumers said they were doing at least okay financially, up from 72% in early April, the survey found.
The increase was likely due to more people returning to work or receiving aid from the government or from charitable organizations, researchers noted in the report, which was a supplement to the Fed's annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking. 
Some 70% of adults said in July they would be able to handle an unexpected expense of $400 by using cash, savings, or a credit card that they could pay off by the next statement. That was up from 63% last October. 
However, many Americans who lost jobs during the coronavirus crisis were still out of work and faced dwindling odds of returning to their old roles. In July, some 22% of adults who had been laid off said they still were not working and did not expect to get their old jobs back, up from 7% in April. 

Higher-income workers were more likely to return to their jobs after being laid off. Only 25% of laid-off people with family incomes below $40,000 went back to the jobs they once had, compared with 39% of laid-off workers with family incomes over $100,000, the report found.

An additional $2 billion grant for Puerto Rico's Education Department will ""focus on restoring school buildings and educational facilities across the island,"" the White House said.
Puerto Rico was already struggling financially before the deadly hurricane struck three years ago, and filed a form of municipal bankruptcy for the commonwealth in 2017 to restructure about $120 billion of debt and obligations. 
Since then, the U.S. commonwealth has been hit by more hurricanes, earthquakes, the coronavirus pandemic and political upheaval, and has been the target of increased federal scrutiny into its use of U.S. aid. A large portion of its financial distress was linked to the territory's power utility.

336,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>",Fed officials tussle over practical meaning of new inflation policy,"By Howard Schneider and Ann Saphir
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers on Friday began fleshing out what their new tolerance for inflation will mean in practice, an issue critical to how investors and households reshape their own outlooks even if it may not be relevant to any immediate decisions by the U.S. central bank.
The new policy, laid out in a strategic document last month and incorporated into a policy statement issued on Wednesday, pledges to keep interest rates near zero until inflation has hit the Fed's 2% target and is on track ""to moderately exceed"" it ""for some time.""
As it stands, with the coronavirus pandemic sapping demand, leaving millions of Americans unemployed, and threatening the survival of entire industries, inflation is not seen as the core risk. Economic projections released by the Fed this week show inflation only reaching 2% by the end of 2023, with any shift towards tighter monetary policy likely years down the road.
But how the Fed's new language is interpreted by the central bank's five current Washington-based governors and 12 regional bank presidents will be central to whether bond markets, stock investors and even consumers see the new approach as likely to be effective, and start behaving in a way that actually helps push inflation higher. 
After years of weak inflation, that is the Fed's hope. It is based on fears of a Japanese-style low inflation rut that can have its own damaging effects over time, and Fed officials on Friday started to outline their views of how to proceed.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said, for example, that he'd be paying closer attention to how fast inflation rises rather than to its quarter-to-quarter level in implementing the new approach.
In an interview on Bloomberg Television, Bostic said if inflation went up to 2.3% but appeared stable ""that would be fine ... By contrast if we were at 2.2 and the next quarter at 2.4 and then at 2.6, that trajectory would give me concern"" and perhaps require efforts to cool the economy. 
'GHOST STORIES'
Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, in contrast, laid out a more open-ended view in written comments describing why he dissented against the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee's policy statement on Wednesday.
The Fed, he felt, was setting itself up to make the same mistake it has in the past of reacting too quickly to inflation ""ghost stories"" and risked nipping off job growth too soon.
He said the Fed instead should switch its focus to core inflation, a slower moving variable that excludes volatile commodity prices, and ensure that it reached 2% on a ""sustained basis.""
""I would have preferred the Committee make a stronger commitment to not raising rates until we were certain to have achieved our dual mandate objectives,"" of maximum employment consistent with stable prices, Kashkari said in an essay.
A second dissent from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan argued the central bank should keep its options open to raise rates sooner if needed - a sign of the broad debate now taking place over just what the new framework will mean in practice.
Critics say they feel the Fed's new approach rings hollow without strong measures to back it up and produce the higher inflation they seek, such as more aggressive bond-buying.
But St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said inflation may move higher on its own if, as he suspects, the economic recovery gains traction at a time when global supply chains are being reorganized, monetary policy is loose, and governments are issuing record levels of debt to finance pandemic-related spending.
""A lot of people on Wall Street are saying 'you could not hit 2%, how are you going to have inflation above 2%?'"", Bullard said in webcast remarks to a Washington University in St. Louis forum.

Before the coronavirus crisis brought air traffic to a standstill and many airlines to their knees, the sector had been fighting a losing battle against emissions taxes in Europe.
New taxes on air travel were among proposals from a Citizens' Climate Council in response to the ""yellow vest"" movement, which began as a protest at the cost of living and became a rebellion against President Emmanuel Macron himself.
Macron has said that he would take on most of the council's 150 proposals, and the taxes were not among those he has said would be excluded.
After suffering losses to green candidates in June's municipal elections, Macron sought to enhance his environmental credentials, but not at the expense of economic activity.
""When a sector has its head under the water, you don't push its head in deeper,"" government spokesman Gabriel Attal told Europe 1 radio, echoing comments by the finance minister.
Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that it would be ""completely grotesque"" to hit aviation with new taxes at a time when the state is pumping 18 billion euros into the sector through various forms of aid to keep it afloat.
But this could become a source of tension with Macron's new Environment Minister Barbara Pompili, an environmentalist brought into government in July.
An official in Pompili's office said that discussions were still under way among ministers and that she would not take a position until they were done.

Even if the taxes make it to parliament, they would likely end up being defeated there, one lawmaker told Reuters.

The median estimate in a Reuters poll of 17 economists was for the central bank to keep its one-week repo rate steady at 8.25%. Three economists expected a rate hike with the estimates ranging between 100 basis points and 150 basis points.
The central bank has held its one-week repo rate steady at 8.25% at its last three meetings, following a nearly year-long easing cycle that saw the policy rate cut aggressively from 24%.
Instead of a formal hike, the central bank has resorted to back-door methods to tighten policy, using liquidity measures and directing lenders to borrow at a higher rate. Analysts say the bank is under political pressure not to hike rates.
Four former Turkish Central Bank policymakers, including a governor, have told Reuters the bank should set aside such back-door policy tools and use next week's meeting to formally raise the benchmark policy rate. 
The bank's weighted average cost of funding  rose to 10.41% as of Thursday, due to back-door liquidity measures, from a low of 7.34% on July 16.
The median estimate for the weighted average cost of funding at end-September was 10.70%. The forecasts of the 12 economists who responded to the question ranged between 10.5% and 12.25%.
Negative yields due to high inflation, concerns over the central bank's depleted forex reserves and tensions with the European Union over the east Mediterrenean have hit the lira.
Seven economists estimated that the bank will keep its policy rate unchanged until year-end, while six forecast hikes. Estimates for the hike ranged between 25 basis points to 8.5% and 375 basis points to 12%.
The median for the weighted average cost of funding at year-end was 12%, with forecasts ranging between 11% and 13.25%.

The central bank is scheduled to announce its rate decision on Sept. 24 at 1100 GMT.

340,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>","Slowing U.S. Economy Needs More Fiscal Aid, Fed’s Bostic Says","(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said Congress needs to provide additional fiscal support for the U.S. economy, which has lost momentum as some aid has lapsed and the coronavirus pandemic has lasted longer than expected.
“We definitely see signs of slowing,” Bostic, who doesn’t vote on monetary policy this year, said Friday in a Bloomberg Television interview with Michael McKee. “What I would tell a policy maker is, there are lots of sectors where there is still a lot of pain and disruption that is going on. There are a lot of families who have a significant amount of uncertainty and those things will wear on our psyche and our ability to grow.”
Fed officials held interest rates near zero this week and signaled they would stay there for at least three years, vowing to delay tightening until the U.S. gets back to maximum employment and its 2% inflation target. The Federal Open Market Committee stressed there was a high level of uncertainty with much of the outlook depending on the course of the virus.
“Eviction levels in Atlanta are higher now than a year ago and the trend is going in the wrong direction,” Bostic said. “I have heard reports this is happening all over the place.”
New Framework
The Fed last month adopted a new monetary policy framework calling for an average 2% inflation, allowing for overshooting for past misses. This week’s statement pledged no rate hikes until the Fed achieved its inflation and maximum employment goals.
“The policies coming out of the long-run framework are important because we are committing to letting the economy grow a little more robustly than we might have otherwise,” Bostic said. “That has and should have positive implications for the ability of minorities and women and lower-income people to be fully attached to the economy.”
Stronger Guidance
Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari dissented from this week’s statement because he felt the wording left open the door to premature tightening, he said in an essay published earlier on Friday. He preferred a stronger commitment to getting inflation up to the Fed’s goal.
“Not raising rates for roughly a year after core inflation first crosses 2% is consistent with a strategy of aiming for a modest overshoot in order to achieve average inflation of 2%,” Kashkari said. “We would only lift off once we had demonstrated that we really were at maximum employment, because core inflation would have had to actually hit or exceed 2% on a sustained basis in order to lift off.”

341,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>",U.S. Consumer Sentiment Climbed to a Six-Month High in September,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer sentiment increased more than expected in early September to a six-month high as Americans grew more upbeat about the economy’s prospects.
The University of Michigan’s preliminary sentiment index for September advanced to 78.9 from a final August reading of 74.1, according to data released Friday. The median estimate from economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 75.
The measure of expectations rose 4.8 points to 73.3, also a six-month high, while a gauge of current conditions increased 4.6 points to 87.5.
Just 16% of respondents said they expected the economy to worsen in the year ahead, the smallest share since 2015 and consistent with an economy and labor market that are slowly recovering. The gauge of sentiment, however, still remains below its pre-pandemic levels and Americans were less upbeat about the prospects for their finances.
The S&P 500 swung between gains and losses as investors searched for new catalysts to give direction to global markets. Treasuries were little changed and the dollar strengthened.
A separate report on Thursday showed that the labor market is gradually improving as the number of Americans applying for jobless benefits continued to decline.
Consumers were more sanguine about buying conditions for durable goods.
With the election approaching, Americans’ attitudes about the economy, job market and financial situations will play a role in which presidential candidate voters decide to support in November.
“Over the next several months, there are two factors that could cause volatile shifts and steep losses in consumer confidence: how the election is decided and the delays in obtaining vaccinations,” Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said in a statement.
The Michigan report also showed inflation expectations declined slightly in September. Consumers anticipated inflation rising 2.7% in the year ahead, down from 3.1% in August, while longer term inflation expectations also fell.
The survey covered responses received through Sept. 14. The final report will be issued on Oct. 2.

342,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>",Kashkari Says New Fed Plan Could Lead to Repeat of Past Mistakes,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s new guidance about when it will raise interest rates leaves the door open to premature tightening of monetary policy again and should be replaced with a stronger commitment to fulfill its mandates, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said.
“Not raising rates for roughly a year after core inflation first crosses 2% is consistent with a strategy of aiming for a modest overshoot in order to achieve average inflation of 2%,” Kashkari said Friday in an essay posted on Medium.com. “We would only lift off once we had demonstrated that we really were at maximum employment, because core inflation would have had to actually hit or exceed 2% on a sustained basis in order to lift off.”
Kashkari, the most outspoken dove on the U.S. central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee, dissented from a decision Wednesday to issue guidance stating the benchmark rate would remain near zero “until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2% and is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time.”
Fed officials slashed the benchmark to nearly zero in March at the onset of the pandemic, and Wednesday published projections showing most of them expected to keep it there at least through the end of 2023.
The Minneapolis Fed chief said the new guidance risks a repeat of what he views as the mistakes the FOMC made from 2015 to 2018, when it raised interest rates before achieving its employment and inflation goals. In 2019, the committee partially reversed course, authorizing three rate cuts in response to a global economic slowdown that was exacerbated by trade tensions.
“This new forward guidance would likely have deferred liftoff from December 2015 to January 2017, a little more than one year later,” Kashkari said. “While that would have been an improvement over what the committee actually did, we still would have been lifting off based on a misreading of the labor market and a false signal that underlying inflation had really returned to target.”

343,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 10:15AM ET</span>",India's Modi defends new law as critics warn of risks to farmers,"By Mayank Bhardwaj and Rajendra Jadhav
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi defended new laws aimed at lifting restrictions on farmers on Friday after protests by opposition parties, some farming bodies and even an ally of his Bharatiya Janata Party.
India's lower house of parliament on Thursday passed three emergency executive orders issued in June by Modi's cabinet which were targeted at reforming the antiquated Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act.
This includes a rule that forces growers to sell their produce only at India's more than 7,000 regulated wholesale markets and Modi said the new legislation would ""unshackle"" millions of farmers and help them get better prices. 
""It will also remove middlemen and let farmers sell their produce directly to buyers,"" Modi said.
Many farmer organisations oppose the legislation because they say that if big buyers start buying directly from producers, small growers will hardly have any bargaining power.
""The APMC Act forces every buyer to come to wholesale markets, which is designed to help farmers get competitive, assured and timely payments,"" Dharmendra Malik, a farm leader from Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, said.
If big institutions start purchasing directly from farmers, state governments will lose out on the tax that these buyers have to pay at wholesale markets, Malik said.
""The current system ensures that farmers are paid immediately after selling their crop in the market yard itself. If farmers sell outside, who will ensure that they are paid the promised price?"" a Maharashtra state official said.
Modi has said that the wholesale markets will operate as usual as the APMC Act has not been abolished and that farmers are simply being given an option to sell directly to buyers.
But Sudhir Panwar, chief of farmers' group Kisan Jagriti Manch, said if large buyers are allowed to buy directly from farmers, wholesale markets would gradually disappear.
India's food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned on Thursday, calling the legislation ""anti-farmer"".

Badal's Shiromani Akali Dal party is a BJP ally with a strong base in Punjab, one of India's two bread basket states, where farmers form an influential voting bloc.

344,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 10:05AM ET</span>",What are the Fed's new hurdles for rate hikes? Only the Fed knows,"By Ann Saphir and Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday effectively established a three-part test that must be met before it will raise interest rates: the economy must be at ""maximum employment,"" inflation must have ""risen to 2 percent"" and it must be ""on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."" 
It may be years before the economy reaches any of those hurdles, let alone all three, fresh forecasts released by the Fed on Wednesday suggest. Most policymakers see inflation only reaching 2% by 2023, with unemployment still above pre-crisis levels. 
Even so, questions are already swirling about what the hurdles will mean in practice.
LOW UNEMPLOYMENT, BUT SO MUCH MORE
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the economy was a ""long way"" from meeting this test and that he would ""love"" to get back to the pre-crisis unemployment rate of 3.5% or lower, from 8.4% now. 
Still, he said there is ""no magic number"" defining maximum employment and then went on to list a number of other benchmarks the Fed would need to see met, including high labor force participation and wage growth.
The lack of precision for measuring maximum employment, a goal the Fed only last month chose to emphasize in a revamp of its operating framework, ""renders the full employment threshold largely meaningless""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economists wrote. It means, in practice, ""the Fed will rely on inflationary pressures to indicate when maximum employment has been obtained.""
STICKING THE LANDING ON INFLATION
To meet the hurdle on inflation rising to 2%, Powell said Wednesday, it wouldn't be enough for inflation to hit 2% for just one month and then fall back. ""The idea that we would look for the quickest way out is just not who we are,"" he said.
But how many months of 2% inflation are enough? He didn't say. Nor did he say how they would get it there in the first place. 
""The direction is a very sensible one,"" said Randall Kroszner, deputy dean of the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business and a former Fed governor. ""But I am concerned that they think this is now going to make a big difference in terms of market expectations and in some sense that this may substitute for other actions"" such as more bond buying to push down longer-term borrowing costs. 
'ON TRACK TO MODERATELY EXCEED 2%... FOR SOME TIME'
Of the three tests, this one came with the most modifiers. Powell gave some clarification, saying the Fed is aiming for inflation ""not very high above 2%"" and ""not permanently, not for a sustained period."" 
Inflation hasn't done more than rise briefly above 2% for many years, not just when the U.S. economy was weak but even when unemployment was plumbing decades-low levels in the months before the coronavirus crisis hit. Globalization, trade and advances in technology have been pushing down on prices worldwide; aging populations in the United States and elsewhere have similarly muted inflation by slowing growth and demand. None of that is going away.
Determining whether inflation is ""on track"" to satisfy both the ""moderately"" and ""for some time"" requirements may fall largely to a judgment call.
Still, says Nomura's chief U.S. economist Lewis Alexander, if the Fed manages to meet its first two hurdles - maximum employment and 2% inflation, ""with short-term rates still at the effective lower bound, it seems likely that the third condition will be met."" 
WHAT ABOUT WIGGLE ROOM?
The new guidance is the Fed's version of a ""pinky promise"" on interest rates - they won't raise them until the test is met. 
""Basically they have set themselves up to ignore any improvement until you get to this magical point where inflation is above 2%,"" says University of Oregon economics professor Tim Duy. 
But what if the recovery, which so far has been faster than many at the Fed expected, continues to beat forecasts?
""They have at least in the near term really locked themselves into a path where it's going to be hard to back away from low interest rates,"" Duy said. The Fed, however, did not make a similar promise on maintaining asset purchases, and could cut them if financial markets or the economy seemed to be heating up too fast, he said. 
Others see it differently. ""While the forward guidance does not apply to QE, we should expect that asset purchases will continue at least until maximum employment and 2% inflation are well within sight,"" wrote Steven Friedman, an economist at MacKay Shields.

The Fed this week began putting more specific language around that strategy, but it will be interpreted differently by each policymaker. For his part Bostic said if inflation went up to 2.3% but appeared stable ""that would be fine...By contrast if we were at 2.2 and the next quarter at 2.4 and then at 2.6 that trajectory would give me concern"" and perhaps require efforts to cool the economy.

347,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 09:05AM ET</span>",Fed's Kashkari wanted stronger commitment to delay rate hikes,"(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve should have adopted more forceful forward guidance to return the U.S. economy to full strength, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said on Friday, with a vow to delay interest rate hikes until core inflation had stayed at 2% for roughly a year.
The U.S. central bank earlier this week signaled it would keep interest rates in their current range of 0% to 0.25% until the economy reaches maximum employment, inflation has risen to 2% and is ""on track"" to modestly exceed that. 
But that promise could still mean the Fed could end up raising rates before the economy really reaches full employment, Kashkari said in an essay explaining why he dissented on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee's decision.
""I would have preferred the Committee make a stronger commitment to not raising rates until we were certain to have achieved our dual mandate objectives,"" Kashkari wrote. 
The Fed should not tie rate hikes at all to readings of the labor market, which it misread in the aftermath of the last recession and, as a result, ended up stifling the recovery by raising rates too early, he said. 
""Not raising rates for roughly a year after core inflation first crosses 2 percent is consistent with a strategy of aiming for a modest overshoot in order to achieve average inflation of 2 percent,"" Kashkari said.
The Minneapolis Fed president also dissented during the central bank's last round of rate hikes. If the new guidance had been in effect then, he said on Wednesday, the Fed would likely have waited about a year, until January 2017, to lift off from the near-zero level of interest rates, but that would still have left the economy short of full employment, he said. 

Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan cast a second dissent at this week's policy meeting, though for an entirely different reason: he felt the Fed's new promise to keep rates near zero left it with too little flexibility to raise rates if needed.

The United States imposed sanctions on Thursday on an official from Hezbollah, a movement backed by Iran and deemed a terrorist group by Washington, and two firms based in Lebanon, which is wrestling with an economic crisis.
The U.S. Treasury said those targeted had ties to the heavily armed and politically powerful Shi'ite Muslim group.
The measures build on sanctions the United States imposed this month on two former Lebanese government ministers, who it accused of enabling Hezbollah.
""The company is surprised that the American administration accused it of corruption and enriching some individuals at the expense of the Lebanese people,"" said Arch Consulting, one of the two firms blacklisted by the Treasury Department.
The statement blamed Washington's ""policy of sanctions and blockade"" for Lebanon's ""deteriorating economic conditions"".
Lebanon's economy is collapsing after the nation built up a mountain of debt following its 1975-1990 civil war. Its banks are paralysed, its currency has crashed and it has defaulted on its sovereign borrowing.
Adding to its problems, a huge port blast in August ripped through Beirut, killing nearly 200 people, injuring thousands of others and causing damage estimated at billions of dollars.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday announced a new round of about $13 billion pandemic assistance to farmers while the White House separately suggested giving U.S. airlines $25 billion in aid over the next six months to stave off thousands of employee layoffs.
The administration's push comes as the White House and Congress remained deadlocked over further economic relief amid the COVID-19 crisis ahead of the Nov. 3 election, although Trump on Thursday appeared to push for sweeping new aid despite a push by fellow Republicans in the Senate for a leaner spending plan. [L1N2GD1CY]
""The reason the White House might be receptive to a stand- alone deal is that it's not right to punish the airlines differentially because of coronavirus,"" Ross told Fox Business Network, adding: ""We've got to bridge the airlines ... bridge their employees if we can through that period"" until there is a COVID-19 vaccine. 
Current federal aid is set to expire Oct. 1 and multiple carriers have said they will have to lay off thousands of pilots and other workers without more relief.
He also said while China was buying more U.S. agricultural goods, there was a still a lag and that American farmers were also being hit by the virus, telling the network: ""It still is necessary to give the farmers a helping hand through this temporary period.""
Asked if other industries such as restaurants that had also been hurt by the pandemic could see federal aid, Ross said they had already been helped in other ways.

""Restaurants ... got protected in a different way,"" with programs aimed at small businesses even though they were not restaurant-specific, he said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Helen Balfors, a project leader at Norwegian conglomerate Orkla, has been working from home for longer than most of her colleagues after returning from a skiing trip to Italy in February as the new coronavirus took hold in Europe.
The mother of three said that while the company had always encouraged a good work-life balance, some managers had required their employees to be in the office before the pandemic hit.
""But now they realise it works just as well to be at home,"" she said. ""I just needed an extra screen and an extra keyboard from the office, which I got in a couple of days.""
Well-developed digital infrastructure has helped the Nordic economies weather the pandemic better than most of Europe.
Britain's economy contracted by around a fifth in the second quarter, Spain registered an 18.5% drop, while the euro zone economy as a whole shrank 11.8%.
In contrast, Finland's GDP fell just 4.5% although Sweden and Norway saw larger hits of 8.3% and 6.3% respectively.
""Better digital infrastructure means we were quicker at being able to work from home. The infrastructure is there and we are used to using it,"" said Robert Bergqvist, chief economist at Swedish bank SEB.
""That has helped hold up production and consumption.""
Denmark, Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands had the most advanced digital economies in the EU in 2018, a research paper from the European Commission showed, based on connectivity, human capital, internet use and extent of e-commerce.
(Graphic: Development of GDP in Europe during COVID pandemic, https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/GDP-EUROPE/oakveowygvr/chart.png)
FLEXIBILITY
The Nordics - home to telecoms infrastructure firms Ericsson (ST:ERICb) and Nokia (HE:NOKIA) - topped the EU table for home-working even before the pandemic. Sweden, in first place, had just under a third of workers working from home, at least occasionally, in 2019, according to the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), an EU agency. The EU average was around 10%.
Long-term flexible employment practices, such as allowing parents to stay home with sick children and an emphasis on a healthy work-life balance have encouraged remote working.
During the pandemic, around 60% of Finns have been able to work from home, around double the level in Spain. Sweden and Denmark are also well above the EU average of less than 40%, according to Eurofound.
A high proportion of information technology-focused jobs that lend themselves to distance working has helped but businesses and individuals have been quick to make the digital leap.
That, along with well-established rules for furloughing employees, means working hours have dropped less than in most of Europe - by 4.2% in Norway in the second quarter against a drop of 10.7% for the euro zone as a whole, Eurostat data shows.
With workers retaining at least some income, household spending and consumption have held up well.
Eurofound's survey showed around 70% of Swedes, Finns and Danes were optimistic about their future against just 45% across the EU.

TO LOCK DOWN OR NOT TO LOCK DOWN
The Nordic economic resilience has come despite very different approaches to fighting the virus.
While Sweden took a light-touch approach, Norway, Denmark and Finland all opted for stricter measures, with Finland isolating its capital from the rest of the country.
That means other factors have played a significant role.
""The structure of the economy is an obvious candidate, where many southern European countries are more dependent on tourism,"" Riksbank Deputy Governor Martin Floden said this earlier month.
Tourism accounts for just under 15% of GDP in Spain and Italy - two of the economies worst hit by the pandemic - according to the World Travel & Tourism Council. Denmark's share is 6.6% and Norway 8.0%.
On the flip side, Norway has had to contend with the collapse in oil prices, while Sweden's automotive sector has been badly hit.
But strong public finances have given Nordic governments the flexibility to spend their way out of trouble. Norway raided its wealth fund - the world's biggest.
According to SEB, the Nordics have implemented direct spending measures of around 5.5% of GDP compared with around 4.4% for France, 3.7% for Spain and 3.4% for Italy.
Yet government largesse is not everything.
Germany has spent more, around 8% of GDP, yet in the second quarter its economy contracted almost 10%.
Analysts caution that a final assessment of government and central bank measures and the effects on health and the economy will have to wait given the risk of a second wave of infections and the longer-term goals of many spending programmes.
Working from home, however, is here to stay.
Orkla's Balfors said many people were now questioning why they needed to spend a whole day travelling to Norway for meetings with her company when there was the technology to hold them remotely.
""It is going to change the way people see working from home - I'm completely sure of that,"" she said.

In July 2020, the number of notes in circulation reached a record high of 4.4 billion, with a monetary value of 76.5 billion pounds, up from 24 billion pounds in 2000.
But the National Audit Office said the Bank of England in 2018 estimated only about 20%–24% of the value of notes in circulation were being used or held for cash transactions,
with UK households holding a further 5% as savings.
""Little is known about the remainder, worth approximately 50 billion pounds,"" The National Audit Office, Britain's independent public spending watchdog, said in a report. 
""Possible explanations include holdings overseas for transactions or savings and possibly holdings in the UK of unreported domestic savings or for use in the shadow economy.""
The Audit Office said the Bank of England and other institutions should improve their understanding of why demand for cash has increased. The Bank of England declined to comment. 
""The Bank, working with other public authorities, should improve its understanding of both the factors that are driving the increase in demand for notes, and also who is holding the approximately £50 billion worth of notes,"" it said.

""This work might help inform wider policy, for example on tax evasion,"" it said.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian car dealer Realszisztema has shelved plans to build a $1.7 million service facility and warehouse. Auto supplier AGC Glass Hungary, too, is turning away from expansion ambitions as it faces a future of fewer workers and sliding sales.
The companies are part of an auto industry that until recently had been a mainstay of a strong Hungarian economy, and a sector that Prime Minister Viktor Orban has hailed as a testament to his stewardship of the nation.
Realszisztema and some other Hungarian companies weathered the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic reasonably well. But now they are preparing for a second wave, which has injected a renewed sense of uncertainty into their business plans, and the economic fallout is expected to stretch into 2021 and beyond. 
Hungary's weakened prospects could represent the biggest threat to Orban's decade-long rule as he prepares to face parliamentary elections in the first half of 2022.
Orban, whose stated aim has been to transform his country into an ""illiberal democracy"", has drawn censure abroad with his anti-immigration rhetoric and sweeping reforms that have earned him accusations of authoritarianism from the European Union. He has denied these accusations.
He has nonetheless enjoyed enduring popularity at home, winning three straight terms to become Hungary's longest-serving post-communist leader, and has repeatedly shown his ability to bring tens of thousands of supporters onto the streets.
However he has long relied on the economy as a major vote-winner, with strong financial support for families, and has emphasised his role in helping develop industries such as autos and overseeing the growth of a large ecosystem of suppliers around car factories.
""One of the main reasons why Orban's supporters back his Fidesz party is its economic legitimacy. A sense that Fidesz can run a competent economic policy,"" said Andras Biro-Nagy, a political analyst at think-tank Policy Solutions.
The Hungarian government did not respond to a request for comment for this article.
In recent years, the premier has said that Hungary's auto industry was on track to become a regional hub. Even in June this year, when the country looked to have successfully beaten back COVID-19, he gave a rousing speech from a car factory.
""We are in the citadel of Hungarian industry. This factory is the pride of Hungarian industry."" he said. ""We are also somewhere important in terms of the national economy.""
However both this sector and the wider economy are looking more precarious, with little certainty about the future, potentially robbing the premier of a key electoral advantage. 
Last year, the economy expanded by almost 5%, year on year, while the booming car sector increased output by more than 10%. 
This year the economy shrank 13.6% in the second quarter, the deepest contraction in Central Europe, and is not expected to rebound until 2022 or 2023. Some 200,000 people have lost their jobs. Car sector output, meanwhile, was down more than 24% in the first seven months of 2020.
'THE LAST STRAW'
Authorities warn of a second wave of infections towards the end of this year, and businesses are worried.
AGC Glass, for example, estimates its turnover next year will be 15% below 2019 levels.
""The size of the cake in Europe will be smaller and competition for each slice will be stiffer,"" its human resources director Mihaly Giber said. ""If half of the factory is put into quarantine, we will not be able to meet the demands of clients."" 
Orban's Fidesz party currently leads in opinion polls and it is unclear how long Hungary's economy will be impacted by the virus or if voters in 2022 will hold him responsible for the economic consequences of a once-in-a-century pandemic, according to political analysts.
They say, however, that Orban's hardline stance on immigration, which has been a big factor is his electoral success, is unlikely to dominate the agenda as in the past.
""The social aspects of handling the economic crisis will be key in the forthcoming period, that is, whether people start blaming the government for their deteriorating financial situation,"" said Biro-Nagy of Policy Solutions.
Orban's three-month furlough programme expired last month and there are no indications his government will resurrect it, with the budget projected to run a deficit worth 7% to 9% of economic output. 
The central bank has exhausted most of its monetary firepower. ""We must be prepared that a renewed deterioration of the outlook may be the last straw for lots of participants in the economy,"" Deputy Governor Barnabas Virag told a conference last week.
""They may have tried to maintain their headcount but are now forced into layoffs, they have managed to service their loans ... but now fall into delinquency, or delay investments.""
Companies large and small are hoping they will not be one of those participants.
Car dealer Realszisztema, based near Budapest, obtained a 1 billion forint ($3.3 million) loan under the central bank's $5 billion pandemic funding scheme which, like many businesses, it used to refinance more expensive funding.
However, the interest savings were offset by a retail sector tax used to plug holes in the budget this year. 
In a concerning sign for the future, just a third of the value of the loans taken up by businesses so far has been used for investments.
""If foreign tourism fails to recover, if entire sectors of the economy shift to a lower gear and foreign companies do not replace their fleet every three years, that could affect us,"" said Realszisztema investment director Peter Karai. 
REALITY CHECK
After successive downgrades, the government now expects the economy to shrink by 5%-7% this year, by far the worst performance since Orban's 2010 election landslide.
The premier himself spoke of the gravity of the situation a week ago. ""We cannot afford the virus crippling the country again,"" he said, ruling out another lockdown.
However some economists have raised concerns over a recent spike that has seen hundreds of new infections recorded a day since the end of August, with the total number more than doubling to over 15,000.
""The alarmingly virulent spread of the virus in early September does not bode well for a fully-fledged continuation of the recovery,"" economists at Raiffeisen said in a note.
Hungarians became more pessimistic about the economy in September, a survey by the GKI think-tank found, mostly due to deteriorating employment prospects. That reversed a gradually improving trend since a nosedive in April.
""It will be late-2022 or early-2023 by the time we reach pre-crisis GDP levels and the slow recovery will largely stem from the labour market,"" said economist Peter Virovacz at ING.
""(We will see) high or rising unemployment, a looser labour market, weaker wage growth and consumption also taking a hit.""
AGC Glass is not planning any expansion in the foreseeable future. Despite hiring about 80 people since the economy reopened, its workforce remains below pre-Covid levels.
Giber is concerned about the availability of workers as infections are rising. ""If the situation in schools deteriorates and some parents need to stay at home with their children, that will hit the workforce.""

353,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>","Around 5 million UK jobs still furloughed at end of July, government says","LONDON (Reuters) - Around 5 million British jobs remained fully or partly on furlough at the end of July, down from a peak of just under 9 million but still leaving millions of workers facing uncertainty with the scheme due to be wound up at the end of next month.
Provisional tax data released on Friday showed employers had registered 4.8 million jobs as furloughed as of July 31, down from a peak of 8.9 million in early May.
The government said final data could show an upward revision of around 10%, making it likely that 5.3 million jobs were still furloughed at the end of July.
Since July employers have been able to bring furloughed staff back part-time, but still claim furlough payments for the hours when staff are not working.
The 4.8 million jobs registered as furloughed included 950,000 where staff are now back working part-time but less than their usual hours, the finance ministry said.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak has resisted calls to extend the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme beyond the end of October but has said he will be ""creative"" in finding ways to minimise any future rise in unemployment.
""These figures show the success of our furlough scheme -- making sure people's jobs are there for them to return to,"" he said on Friday.
Budget forecasters expect the programme to cost around 54 billion pounds ($70 billion) over its eight-month lifespan.
Use of the scheme has varied widely across sectors, with more than 40% of staff in the hospitality sector still furloughed, but only a small fraction of those in sectors such as finance or IT where it is easier to work from home.
Britain's official jobless rate rose slightly to 4.1% in the three months to the end of July, and the Bank of England has forecast it will hit 7.5% by the end of this year.
Less comprehensive but more timely survey data from the Office for National Statistics suggests the number of furloughed workers continued to fall through August but remained high.

The Resolution Foundation think-tank estimated, based on the ONS data, that around 3 million people were furloughed at the end of August.

354,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>","Biden or Trump, no guarantee of a post-Brexit U.S.-UK trade deal","By Andrea Shalal and David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden's recent warning that Britain must honor Northern Ireland's 1998 peace agreement to secure a U.S. trade deal adds new complexity to already tough trade talks between the United States and the U.K.
""We can't allow the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit,"" Biden wrote on Twitter on Wednesday, referring to the deal that ended three decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland and created a shared regional government.
Biden was echoing Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's warning last week that any move by Britain to erect physical customs borders between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland meant ""no chance"" for a U.S.-UK trade deal. 
His warning comes as U.S. negotiators in the Trump administration wrap up a fourth round of trade talks with their British counterparts in Washington this week. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday the talks could ""reach a successful conclusion before too long."" 
No matter how they end, U.S. law gives Congress authority over trade policy. President Donald Trump has sometimes sidestepped that authority on trade issues, but U.S. and UK officials have said they are aiming for a comprehensive agreement that would need Congress's approval.
The U.S. election in November is expected to leave the House in Democratic hands, giving extra weight to Pelosi's words. 
Both the U.S. and U.K. have other hurdles to clear as well, trade experts say. 
""Removing the Good Friday agreement is a non-starter, but there are five or six other potentially really difficult issues that the two countries are still far apart on,"" said Harry Broadman, managing director with the Berkeley Research Group and a former senior U.S. trade official, including agriculture, the British health system and Britain's proposed digital services tax.
NON-NEGOTIABLE
Asked about the Trump administration's view Thursday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer's office pointed to his June testimony to Congress, where he said there is no chance Congress would pass a trade deal if Britain put up borders in Ireland, violating the Good Friday agreement.
""I've made that quite clear. The chairman [of the committee] has made it quite clear to me. The president agrees this is not something on which we're going to have a negotiation,"" he said. 
The Good Friday agreement is in jeopardy, some diplomats say, because of new legislation proposed by British prime minister Boris Johnson. 
British trade officials have repeatedly said they are seeking a comprehensive trade deal and are not seeking to rush into an agreement before the U.S. election, nor waiting to see who wins at the polls in November.
U.S. and British trade negotiators were expected to discuss one of the thorniest issues between the two countries in the current round of trade talks - increased access for agricultural products. 
British trade minister Liz Truss has pledged to drive a ""hard bargain"" with the United States, vowing that Britain would not diminish its food safety standards to import American products such as chlorine-treated poultry and genetically modified crops.
Britain wants access for lamb and beef exports to the United States. 
Autos are the largest source of trade between the two economies, and another point of friction. Britain maintains a 10% tariff on any U.S. imports, four times the U.S. tariff on British cars. An outstanding threat by Trump to impose 25% tariffs on imported vehicles makes negotiating down the U.K. rate unlikely, trade experts say. 
Pompeo, speaking Wednesday at a news conference with UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, said he trusted Britain to find a solution.
""We know the complexity of the situation,"" Pompeo said. ""In the end, this will be a set of decisions with respect to this that the United Kingdom makes and (I) have great confidence that they will get this right in a way that treats everyone fairly and gets a good outcome."" 
Raab told CNN on Thursday that the 1998 agreement is ""not in jeopardy."" 
""There is not going to be any hard border, certainly not applied by the UK,"" Raab said, adding that if the EU made a similar commitment, ""it would also help the negotiations.""
Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a non-resident senior fellow Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Biden's warning suggests that perhaps he is just not that interested in a deal.
""The phrasing of not wanting northern Irish peace to be a victim of Brexit, that's a really forceful intervention by a potential future American president - basically disavowing the signature project that defines the current British government. It's difficult to imagine that wording is not reflective of Biden's overall interest in pursuing this deal.""
Trump has developed close ties to Johnson, but Biden's warning suggests he may not do the same, he said.

""This signals to me that the 'special relationship' between a Biden administration and Boris Johnson's government, especially in a no-deal Brexit, is not going to be very special.""

355,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 07:07AM ET</span>",Banks in Britain ready for Libor milestone next month: BoE,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Banks in Britain will be ready in two week's time to offer companies loans not pegged to the Libor interest rate benchmark, in a major milestone towards phasing it out, British financial regulators said on Friday.
Banks were fined billions of dollars for trying to rig Libor - the London Interbank Offered Rate - which is used to price trillions of dollars of financial contracts from mortgages to credit cards globally.
Regulators want the financial services companies to switch to alternative benchmarks and ditch Libor by December 2021 in the finance industry's biggest change in decades.
""Sooner or later a benchmark based on such shaky foundations will collapse,"" Andrew Hauser, executive director for markets at the Bank of England told an online event held by the central bank.
Hauser said very few actual transactions now underpin Libor, making the benchmark effectively based on ""informed guesswork."" 
Edwin Schooling Latter, head of markets policy at the Financial Conduct Authority, said that from the end of September banks will have to offer non-Libor loan alternatives, pegged, for example, to the BoE's base rate or its overnight Sonia rate.
""If you do choose Libor over the next six months, then your contract with your lender must include an arrangement to convert that to a non-Libor rate at the end of 2021 or before,"" Schooling Latter said.
From the end of March next year, banks will not offer new Libor-pegged loans, he said.
""You will need to be able to conduct all your new business without relying on Libor before the end of 2021,"" Schooling Latter said.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC)' Finance Director Tushar Morzaria, who chairs a financial industry working group looking at the scrapping of Libor, said banks will be ready to offer non-Libor alternatives to all borrowers from the end of the month.
""By the end of the first quarter of next year, as a lending matter, Libor should really be pretty much behind us,"" Morzaria said. ""We are in very good shape there.""

Bankers have also said that not all of their customers are likely to have adapted their IT systems for the switch.

The Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (MARGMA) estimated that the industry could have lost around 7.6 billion ringgit ($1.85 billion) revenue for Malaysia due to labour shortages.
MARGMA had revised its forecast for export revenue up by 36.7% to 29.8 billion ringgit, and export volumes up by 9% to 240 billion pieces of gloves this year.
President Denis Low said MARGMA members are facing challenges in meeting demand from around the world ""and the major stumbling blocks causing the bottleneck are the huge shortages of workers and raw materials.""
""We plead with our Government to allow reasonable number of foreign workers to work in our factories,"" Low said.
MARGMA said the industry's strict rules on over-time is also holding back productivity.
It said members ""do not wish to be accused of forced labour"", but migrant workers have requested to work longer hours to earn more wages to send back to their families.
""Workers are equally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and wish to earn more wages to protect their own families,"" Low said.
The United States Customs has in the last 12 months placed detention orders on two Malaysian glove makers, including the world's largest Top Glove Corp (KL:TPGC), on the grounds that they were suspected of using forced labour.
Top Glove said this week that it continues to work with U.S. authorities to lift the detention order.

IPOs are back. And how. A market that was enduring its worst slump in eight years has been revived by red-hot equity markets and floods of central bank stimulus, with listings coming thick and fast.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s fintech arm Ant Group is planning for what could be the largest ever IPO, while e-commerce firm The Hut Group gave London its biggest IPO in seven years, its shares immediately rallying 30%. 
That was eclipsed by U.S. software firm Snowflake whose value doubled after its debut -- astonishing even by New York's incredible history of first-day pops.
Bankers are talking about a swelling pipeline as firms accelerate listing plans. Europe will soon see German defence firm Hensoldt's IPO; Russia's Sovcomflot and Poland's Allegro are also expected. 
Upcoming New York IPOs include online prescription drug platform GoodRx which hopes to raise $1 billion. Year-to-date IPO volumes are near $120 billion, Refinitiv data shows, a third higher than year-ago levels.
(GRAPHIC: Global IPO volumes - https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-MARKETS/THEMES/rlgvdjlnyvo/chart.png)
2/EARNINGS: POST-PEAK PESSIMISM
Equity analysts may have passed the point of peak pessimism as earnings forecasts are increasingly revised higher, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S. It's an important turning point after a horrendous second quarter when, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), earnings plunged 33% worldwide. 
Now analysts appear less gloomy about what remains of 2020 and more confident of a 2021 profits bounceback; globally, earnings upgrades are outnumbering downgrades. The exception is Europe where expectations haven't fully stabilized for 2020 -- but even here, a 2021 rebound is expected.

3/FOOD OR LEISURE? 
Quarterly results from U.S. firms,  Nike  (N:NKE) and  General Mills  (N:GIS) will offer different perspectives on consumer spending in the midst of the pandemic. Athletic footwear and apparel maker Nike is expected to report a 15% revenue drop and a 49% tumble in adjusted earnings-per-share on Tuesday, Refinitiv data shows. 
In contrast, pantry staples company General Mills may post a 5% rise in revenue and a 10% jump in adjusted earnings on Wednesday, benefiting from consumers stocking up on essential groceries.
With extended unemployment benefits cut for millions of Americans, consumer spending slowed in August and a key retail sales gauge unexpectedly declined. It really boils down to what you need against what you would like.

4/FRANC FIGHTING
Many central banks are battling to lift inflation and growth but the Swiss National Bank has it tougher than most. Despite the world's lowest interest rates, its currency, a popular safe-haven, is near five-year highs and Switzerland has endured a seventh month of annual price deflation.
Policymakers will likely hold off on new announcements on Thursday and wait instead for the European Central Bank's next move. They have spent 2020 intervening to tamp down the franc; the result is a swelling portfolio of valuable U.S. tech stocks. 
But interventions risk the wrath of the United States, which has Switzerland on a currency manipulation watchlist. And despite all efforts, the franc is not far off five-year highs versus the euro (EURCHF=EBS) and 5-1/2 year peaks to the dollar .
Upcoming meetings of Sweden's Riksbank and Norway's Norges Bank won't spark fireworks either. Like the SNB, they will probably pledge to keep rates low as they monitor the ECB's stimulus splurge.

5/AUCKLAND OPENS
The negative-rates debate is heating up, with the Bank of England admitting to studying them. All eyes, therefore, on the Thursday policy meeting of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, whose governor Adrian Orr has signalled willingness to take that step.
So far, Orr is sticking to his line that rates will stay at 0.25% until March. But the meeting takes place just as the country's largest city Auckland lifts coronavirus restrictions, New Zealand endures its worst recession in a decade and campaigning heats up for October elections. 
Other countries' experience implies the RBNZ may end up with asset price inflation rather than a weaker currency, should it embrace sub-zero rates. While the debate is mostly moot for now, the RBNZ's latest views on the subject will be watched.

358,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 06:49AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday, September 18th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com --  The dollar ends the week on a low note and crude oil on a high note. An M&A flurry in Europe creates Spain's biggest bank and sees Apollo eyeing a repeat of its turnaround of LyondellBasell. Stocks are set to open mixed, ahead of the Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey, with the mood supported by another blowout IPO. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, September 18th.
1. Dollar resumes decline; gold rises
The dollar resumed its downward trend amid concern over the outlook for the U.S. economy and the risk that a weakening stock market may feed through into lower global demand for U.S. financial assets.
By 6:40 AM ET (1040 GMT), the dollar index that tracks the greenback against a half dozen other currencies was down 0.1% at 92.90, on course to end the week around 0.5% lower.  Gold Futures, often a mirror image of the dollar, rose 0.6% to $1,962.05 an ounce.
Sterling and the yen both continued their recent advances; the former lifted by better-than-expected retail sales data for August and by upbeat comments on the post-Brexit transition by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and the latter by declining political uncertainty after the appointment of Yashihide Suga as Prime Minister of Japan.
The Chinese yuan also posted its highest weekly close against the dollar since May 2019.
2. Michigan Consumer Sentiment rounds off heavy data week
A heavy week for economic data in the U.S. ends with the University of Michigan’s survey of consumer sentiment, which also includes a survey of inflation expectations.
The figures round off a week that has seen a sharp slowdown in retail sales and industrial output growth in August, along with what is likely to have been a temporary, hurricane-related setback for the housing market.
Analysts expect the main consumer sentiment index to have risen to 75 from 74.1 a month earlier.
Overnight, in addition to U.K. retail sales numbers, German producer price inflation and Italian industrial production also turned out marginally more positive than expected.
3. Stocks set to open mixed; Unity supports tech stock confidence
U.S. stock markets are expected to open mixed, amid ongoing concerns about tech stock valuations despite pockets of considerable strength, especially in the primary market.
Sentiment will be helped by another strong IPO, this time from video games maker Unity, which priced its offering above a marketing range that had already been raised at short notice. That follows the blowout offering from Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) earlier in the week.
By 6:40 AM ET, the Dow futures contract was down 36 points or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 0.1% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.4%.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), which is reportedly eyeing an investment in German chemicals group  Covestro  (OTC:COVTY). The TikTok saga also rolls on, with its implications for Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).
4. CaixaBank, LSE leads Europe M&A flurry
Two of Spain’s largest banks agreed to merge, in a deal that will create the country’s biggest lender.
Caixabank (OTC:CAIXY) and Bankia (OTC:BNKXF), both heavily domestic-focused institutions, will carry out an all-stock deal that should strengthen their joint balance sheet as Spain faces a new wave of bad loans as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Elsewhere in Europe,  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE) moved closer to clinching antitrust approval for its planned acquisition of data provider Refinitiv by entering into exclusive talks with  Euronext  (PA:ENX) for the sale of Italian stock exchange operator Borsa Italiana.
5. Saudi Arabia talks up oil prices
Crude oil prices are ending the week on a high note after Saudi Arabia’s oil minister sent a strongly-worded warning to markets at Thursday’s meeting of ministers from the so-called OPEC+ bloc.
By 6:40, U.S. crude futures were up 0.5% at $41.15 a barrel, on course for a weekly gain of nearly 9%. Brent crude was up 0.7% at $43.59 a barrel.
Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman warned ‘speculators’ not to ‘test the resolve’ of the bloc by trying to push prices any lower. He also dished out strong criticism of countries within the bloc who had produced above their quotas.
The United Arab Emirates, which wasn’t named directly, has already said it will cut export volumes to key Asian markets for the next two months in an effort to placate the group’s most powerful member.

LONDON/MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) -  London Stock Exchange  entered exclusive talks to sell Borsa Italiana to  Euronext  on Friday, with the French operator seeing off Deutsche Boerse and Switzerland's Six as it bids to add another bourse to its pan-European network.
Dubbed ""Project Botticelli"", the LSE's sale of the Milan stock exchange is sensitive in Rome due to concerns about who takes control of its bond platform, which handles trading of Italy's 2.6 trillion euros ($3.1 trillion) of government debt.
The LSE (L:LSE) is selling Borsa as part of regulatory remedies to see through its $27 billion purchase of data provider Refinitiv, which is 45% owned by  Thomson Reuters  (TO:TRI) (N:TRI), parent company of Reuters News.
It was not immediately clear what Euronext (PA:ENX) had offered to gain exclusive talks, but investors welcomed the move and its shares were up 5% at 0946 GMT. LSE stock was up 0.7%.
Offers for Borsa valued it at up to 4 billion euros, sources said before the LSE board reviewed the bids on Thursday.
Chief Executive Stephane Boujnah declined to comment on the value of Euronext's bid, but told Reuters that price was one of several elements LSE had taken into consideration.
Boujnah said Euronext had always considered Borsa ""a natural fit"" and contacts had accelerated since July after years of informal discussions with all relevant stakeholders.
""It's a natural enlargement of Euronext within a framework that already existed, clearly with an unprecedented size. It's the first time we're welcoming within Euronext a G7 economy, the third economy of the European continent with everything that is related to that,"" Boujnah added. 
Euronext had moved to win round both the LSE and Rome by teaming up with Italy's state investor Cassa Depositi e Prestiti and Italian bank  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) in order to gain Italy's buy-in.
Both CDP and Intesa will become shareholders in the French exchange operator, if the bid for Borsa succeeds, by subscribing to a proposed capital increase.
'ITALIAN ECOSYSTEM'
Under the proposed deal, CDP would have a seat on Euronext's supervisory board, with a second Italian candidate proposed as an independent board member who would become chairman, in a nod to how Milan would be the largest contributor to Euronext revenue at roughly 35% of a combined group.
Borsa would join exchanges under the Euronext banner that span Dublin and Oslo to Brussels, Amsterdam and Paris, and add significant bond trading, clearing and settlement capacity.
""Key businesses and central functions of the new group would be based in Milan and Rome,"" Euronext said.
The deal would give Euronext much-needed scale, ownership of a clearing house with critical mass, and scope to scale the business internationally, analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
It would also bring Milan under euro zone ownership after Britain left the EU, a move likely to please Brussels policymakers who want to buttress the bloc's capital market. 
""The Italian government expressed a preference to have a solution, a project within the European Union, within the single market, the euro zone,"" Boujnah said.
Switzerland's Six had no comment, while Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) said it had made an attractive offer that would have given Milan a high degree of autonomy.
LSE Chief Executive David Schwimmer appears keen to have a deal fleshed out before Dec. 16, when EU competition officials decide whether to approve the Refinitiv takeover. 

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) advised LSE on the sale, while Euronext was represented by JP Morgan and Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) and Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) worked with CDP.

MADRID (Reuters) - Caixabank has agreed to buy state-controlled  Bankia  for 4.3 billion euros ($5.1 billion) in an all-share deal that creates Spain's biggest domestic lender and signals consolidation among Europe's struggling banks is picking up pace. 
The merger will create the largest domestic bank by assets with a combined market value of more than 16 billion euros ($19 billion), in a deal underpinned by annual cost savings of 770 million euros, the banks said on Friday.
It comes as the coronavirus crisis puts more pressure on Europe's banks to join forces to deal with rising bad debts and record-low interest rates. Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) is taking over Unione di Banche Italiane, and Spain's Sabadell has also held informal talks about a possible tie-up.
Caixabank (MC:CABK) and Bankia (MC:BKIA) did not say on Friday how many jobs would go or branches would close, but main trade union CCOO fears hefty cuts from a merged bank with over 6,300 branches and more than 51,000 staff in Spain. 
The deal has been described as a merger, but is in effect a takeover by Caixabank as it is almost three times as big as Bankia by market value and almost twice as big by assets.
Caixabank will exchange 0.6845 new shares for every Bankia share, valuing the latter at 1.41 euros per share.
That represents a 20% premium over Bankia's closing price on Sept. 3, before news of merger talks emerged, or a premium of 28% over the average price of the last three months. 
The valuation of Bankia is slightly below Thursday's close of 4.4 billion euros. 
Bankia shares, up almost 40% since news of the merger emerged, were down 1.5% to 1.419 euros at 0735 GMT, while Caixabank stock, which has risen about 14% since the talks surfaced, was up 0.5% to 2.075 euros. 
COSTS, SAVINGS AND STRUCTURE
The banks said in a joint statement they expected annual cost synergies of around 770 million euros by 2023 and new annual revenues of around 290 million euros over five years.
They also estimated 2.2 billion euros in restructuring charges next year, which they expected to be fully covered by 'badwill' - a paper profit that occurs when an asset is bought below its book value.
The banks expect to achieve a fully loaded core Tier-1 capital ratio - a key measure of financial strength - of around 11.3% in the first quarter after the transaction.
Caixabank shareholders will initially represent 74.2% of the capital of the new entity, with Bankia's holding 25.8%. 
Criteria, controlled by the La Caixa foundation, will remain Caixabank's main shareholder with around 30% of the combined bank, while the Spanish state will hold 16.1%, compared with the 61.8% it held in Bankia.
Bankia was bailed out in a 22.4 billion euro state rescue in 2012 at the height of Spain's financial crisis, and so far it has returned just 3.3 billion euros of state aid. 
Analysts believe it could be easier for the state to get its money back from a bigger entity.
The executive chairman of the merged bank will be Bankia's Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri, but with limited powers, while the chief executive Caixabank's current CEO, Gonzalo Gortazar. 
The legal headquarters of the merged bank will be in Valencia, with operating headquarters in Madrid and Barcelona.

Shareholders meetings at Caixabank and Bankia will likely to be held in November to legally approve the deal, which the banks aims to close in the first quarter of 2021.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The European Union must diversify its trade relations, become less dependent on Asian suppliers in certain areas such as medical precursors, and develop its own value chains within the 27-member bloc, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told Reuters.
""The coronavirus pandemic has taught us that Europe must stick together and diversify its trade relations,"" Altmaier said in remarks cleared for publication on Friday.
""That means that there must be no spanner in the works of the EU's internal market and that we have to ensure more resilient supply chains, the development of value chains within the EU, and more legal certainty in international trade.""
As Germany currently holds the presidency of the European Union, Altmaier will host a meeting of fellow EU ministers responsible for trade on Monday, with a special focus on global supply chains and the future of the European steel industry.
Altmaier, a close ally of centre-right Chancellor Angela Merkel, said Europe should not turn its back on globalisation as trade and open markets were still powerful engines that could help propel Europe out of the current economic crisis.
Still, greater autonomy coupled with the development of innovative and resilient EU value chains is needed so that Europe ""can still play in the premier league of the world's economically successful regions"" in the future, Altmaier added.
Asked if Europe and Germany should re-think trade ties with China, Altmaier said that everyone had to acknowledge that in the long term, trade could only work on a level playing field.
""Anyone who wants to enjoy the advantages of the free market in the European Union must also open the doors to European companies,"" Altmaier said.

While Germany over the past decade has benefited massively from Chinese demand for its machines and cars, officials in Berlin and Brussels have become increasingly frustrated in recent years as China has not fully delivered on its promises to engage in fair and free trade.

In a ""frenzy into U.S. stocks"", investors pumped nearly $24 billion into equities in the world's top economy, the largest such inflows since March 2018, said BofA. The inflows come after 10% pullback in Nasdaq 100 (NDX) in early September.

Key supplier Swatch Group (S:UHR) has halted deliveries of mechanisms to the small Zurich-based brand, its managers said, after Switzerland's competition authority released Swatch from an obligation to supply other watchmakers this summer.
The entire Swiss industry has also seen sales plummet as stores were closed by coronavirus lockdowns and Chinese customers, who often buy watches on their travels, have stayed at home.
Still, Maurice de Mauriac, a niche producer which makes about 300 watches per year, has so far got round the supply problems.
The company has been using the tiny mechanisms called ""movements"" it still had in stock and is confident it can get more from a partner still on the customer list of Swatch's mechanism business, ETA. 
""We have long-term relationships with our suppliers,"" said Massimo Dreifuss who, together with his brother Leonard, now manages the company their father Daniel founded in 1997.
Massimo and Leonard have also been organising events to drum up interest in Maurice de Mauriac watches, which cost around 3,500 Swiss francs ($3,850) on average.
They are offering workshops for small groups at the brand's headquarters in central Zurich where enthusiasts can see the brand's three watchmakers working and have a go at assembling a watch themselves. 
Watch retailers from Zurich's Bahnhofstrasse shopping street also regularly send customers to pick a watch strap from the brand's stock of around 2,500 leather, rubber, textile and metal bands, including some proprietary designs.

NEW YORK/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's honeymoon with the International Monetary Fund is about to be tested as it looks to update a $57 billion agreement struck two years ago that failed to prevent a slide into recession and the country's ninth sovereign default.
The IMF, often the target of angry protests in the streets of Buenos Aires, has looked to soften its tone with Argentina as the center-left Peronist government has restructured over $100 billion with private creditors this year.
Now it is IMF money on the table. Argentina is looking to defer some $45 billion in payments over the next few years, as it heads for a 12% economic contraction in 2020 and battles a currency crisis with recently updated capital controls, which speak to an unwillingness to address fiscal and monetary imbalances.
""It will be much harder with the IMF. They will want to make sure they will be prioritized and not defaulted upon,"" said Damien Buchet, an emerging markets fund manager at Finisterre Capital.
""The IMF will want much more serious guarantees in terms of debt sustainability and repayment ability than bondholders.""
Argentine officials say they only want to refinance the $45 billion already received under the 2018 program. But Economy Minister Martin Guzman has said he wants to avoid repayments to the IMF through 2024 - a tough demand.
""The IMF mistakenly supported Argentina in its acrimonious negotiations with investors to close a deal without a coherent economic plan,"" said Ted Pincus, managing director at Mangart Capital Advisors.
""The new FX measures Argentina introduced will make an agreement more difficult and Argentina’s attitude towards investors has come back to bite it.""
With the country in the grips of the coronavirus pandemic, austerity could pose a big threat to center-left President Alberto Fernandez ahead of mid-term elections next year, as poverty rises and small firms go under.
The IMF is still seen by many as having triggered the country's last major crisis in 2001-02, when a default and currency devaluation pushed millions of Argentines into poverty.
""I don't think (Argentina) can afford to be seen as taking orders from the IMF,"" said Eric Baurmeister, senior portfolio manager and head of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management's Emerging Markets Debt team.
""What happens behind closed doors may be a different story.""
(Graphic: Argentina's schedule of payments to the IMF, https://graphics.reuters.com/ARGENTINA-DEBT/IMF/yzdpxnxlopx/chart.png) 
10TH DEFAULT?
Julie Kozack, deputy director of the IMF's Western Hemisphere department, said the fund initially was looking to work out Argentina's priorities and the government's ""plans to strengthen macroeconomic stability, kick-start growth and job creation, and reduce poverty and unemployment.""
She did not elaborate, but many feel Argentina's economy will be harder to turn around than hoped for, with foreign reserves dwindling and capital controls to stem the decline hurting business.
""The IMF will probably insist on labor and pension legislation,"" said Claudio Loser, a former IMF director for the Western Hemisphere, adding that he expects both sides to arrive with different opinions.
""The government is going to say that it cannot do more; the Fund will say we have to understand that Argentina is in a horrible crisis due to the combination of COVID and the debt problem. Then, that (Argentina) will have to put things in order so as not to have problems again in two years,"" Loser said.
The government's 2021 budget bill, presented to Congress this week, included ambitious forecasts for 5.5% growth next year and a primary fiscal deficit of 4.5% of GDP, which will be financed in part with transfers from the central bank.
(Graphic: Argentine monetary base, https://graphics.reuters.com/ARGENTINA-DEBT/IMF/xegpbjndgpq/chart.png) 
""Fernandez has to a strike a difficult balance between a tough stance in negotiations to please his voters and convincing the IMF his administration can go far enough with reforms,"" said Fabiana Fedeli, head of emerging markets at Robeco.
""Unfortunately we have not yet seen any signs that Argentina is willing and able to take the difficult steps that are needed to support macroeconomic stability. Unless lasting reforms are undertaken, a 10th default is possible.""
POLITICAL CAPITAL
Fernandez, voted in with an anti-austerity mandate late last year, has gained some political capital sealing restructuring deals with Wall Street, and bringing the IMF more on-side.
Back in February, the IMF's director Kristalina Georgieva and Guzman sat smilingly side-by-side as Pope Francis, himself an Argentine, spoke at a Vatican conference.
The fund has all but agreed to a $6.5 billion exceptional access program with Ecuador, much more generous and with less conditions than expected, which some say could bode well for Argentina.
More importantly, perhaps, the IMF could use a positive deal after criticism over the size and speed of the 2018 program and past practices in Argentina, including from Fernandez who blames the previous administration for leaving the country saddled with debt.
""It is not the same IMF as in 2001. Much has been learned since. Now it is more flexible regarding some heterodox policies,"" said Gabriel Zelpo, director of Buenos Aires-based financial consultancy Seido. ""But it is still the IMF.""

372,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2020 01:55AM ET</span>","Japan's 'Suganomics' will target quick wins, not grand visions","By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's new prime minister will pursue economic structural reforms through a mixed bag of policies that target specific industries, rather than a grand strategy to reshape society and boost long-term growth.
Armed with a strong grip on Japan's bureaucracy, Yoshihide Suga knows which levers to pull to get results, say government and ruling party officials who know him or have worked with him.
But an initial need to consolidate popular support means he will first target quick policy wins that will later give him the political capital to pursue tougher reforms, they said.
""He isn't after visions. He's someone who wants to accomplish small goals one by one,"" said political analyst Atsuo Ito, a former ruling party staff. ""He'll initially focus on pragmatic goals that directly affect people's livelihood.""
Suga has said he will continue his predecessor Shinzo Abe's pro-growth ""Abenomics"" strategy aimed at pulling Japan out of deflation with heavy monetary and fiscal stimulus coupled with structural reforms.
But unlike Abe, Suga's plans for structural reforms will focus more on spurring competition, rather than deeper social change.
For Suga, economic reform will be a political priority in its own right, unlike Abe, whose reforms were wrapped up in a broader political agenda that included the thorny challenge of revising Japan's pacifist constitution.
Suga must act quickly as his current term lasts for only for a year unless he calls a snap election to win the public's mandate to run a full, three-year term.
That means he will first seek ""quick-hit"" achievements that directly channel money to households. Among the sweeteners would be to slash cellphone charges by around 40%, raise the minimum wage and increase payouts to cushion the blow from the pandemic.
""At this moment, he has to focus on very short-term issues like how to stimulate economy,"" said Heizo Takenaka, who served in the cabinet of reformist former premier Junichiro Koizumi.
Removing protections in industry will be one such objective, even if that riles some parts of corporate Japan. 
""Introducing competition among mobile phone carriers could be a very symbolic policy for Suga because he loves competition,"" said Takenaka, who retains close contact with Suga. ""He hates people with vested interests.""
If successful, Suga could pursue bolder reforms such as liberalising the heavily protected medical sector, consolidating weak regional banks and breaking barriers that hamper competition among small- and mid-sized firms.

KNOWS HOW TO FIGHT
Having served as Abe's top spokesman, Suga already knows his way around Japan's massive bureaucracy.
Suga relaxed visa requirements to boost inbound tourism, overcoming push-back from the justice ministry. He also cut through bureaucratic opposition and expanded a scheme that gave tax breaks for donations to Japan's regional areas.
""Suga may not be charismatic, but he gets things done,"" said Taimei Yamaguchi, a ruling party lawmaker close to Suga. ""Some of the best advice I got from him was to make the most of the expertise the bureaucrats have.""
Some government officials say Suga's focus on deregulation makes his policies closer to those of Koizumi, who consolidated big banks and deregulated the labour market in the early 2000s.
Suga's slogan urging the public to ""look after yourself before seeking government help"" reflects his background as a self-made politician who made his way up from a son of a strawberry farmer to Japan's leader, people who know him say.
""Suga's reforms look more like Koizumi's,"" said one of the officials. ""He probably feels that it's inevitable for some of the small, zombie firms to go under,"" another official said.
For Abe, structural reforms that sought to revive the economy through looser restrictions around immigration, labour and corporations remain largely unfinished business, due to strong political opposition.
The challenge for Suga would be to push through his own painful reforms just as Japan struggles to climb out of its worst post-war slump.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who supported Abenomics with massive monetary stimulus, is hopeful.
""It's tough but there is now a widely accepted view in Japan that deregulation and structural reforms are necessary,"" he said on Thursday.

""Personally, I see a good chance deregulation will succeed.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Leaders of Europe's coronavirus-stricken travel and tourism industries have appealed to the EU's chief executive to press governments to end quarantine requirements and instead embrace coordinated restrictions and testing.
""This chaotic situation requires your immediate personal involvement,"" a broad ad-hoc group of more than 20 industry groups including airline body IATA told European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a letter seen by Reuters.
The appeal came as data from airports' group ACI Europe, one of the signatories to the Sept. 17 letter, pointed to a ""double-dip"" air traffic slump, with passenger numbers down 73% in the first two weeks of September, after a 65% decline in August.
The EU executive this month proposed a common ""traffic light"" system designed to coordinate travel restrictions among EU states and replace the patchwork of rules and quarantine regimes blamed for the renewed collapse in travel.
But with COVID-19 cases rising, governments are reluctant to drop more drastic restrictions and quarantines - condemned by the industry as disproportionate to the risks of travel within a region where community transmission is already widespread.
Ireland, where travel curbs have been challenged in court by Ryanair (I:RYA), moved on Thursday to quarantine arrivals from Italy and Greece on the basis of stricter infection-rate criteria than those proposed by the EU.
""Failure to fully implement the Commission's proposal would kill any chances of a potential recovery,"" the travel industry bodies wrote to von der Leyen.
The letter was signed by an alphabet soup of trade bodies together representing more than 5,000 companies and millions of workers in sectors ranging from aviation and travel agents to hotels, restaurants and campsites, and their supply chains.
""We are thus urging you make this issue a top priority"" in discussions with national leaders, it added, highlighting the 10% of EU economic output generated by tourism and its 12% share of the workforce. ""What is actually at stake is the recovery of Europe and European economies.""
In a non-binding vote on Thursday, EU lawmakers urged member states to adopt common methodologies in their fight against the pandemic, ahead of a Sept. 22 meeting of European affairs ministers that will address better coordinated border controls.

Vedanta (NYSE:VEDL) Resources Ltd.’s billionaire founder is working with Centricus Asset Management Ltd. on the plans, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. They have started approaching potential investors for the proposed India Direct Investment fund, which will buy stakes in government companies being sold as part of the country’s 2.1 trillion-rupee ($29 billion) divestment program, the people said.
The fund will also target companies restructuring under India’s bankruptcy regime, the people said. It will look at both private and public firms, they said. Agarwal and London-based Centricus plan to contribute as much as 10% of the capital, according to the people.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is putting some of India’s corporate icons on the block in a bid to plug budget holes and fund infrastructure spending. Agarwal is seeking to find the gems among the dozens of companies being sold and tap his industry connections to turn them around, as he tries to repeat his success in building up a metals and mining powerhouse.
Deal Spree
Deliberations are at an early stage, and details of the fund could change, the people said. A representative for Agarwal couldn’t immediately comment, while a representative for Centricus declined to comment.
Agarwal has a net worth of about $2.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The former metal trader built his business through a series of ambitious acquisitions over the past few decades, including a 2001 deal to take control of government-owned Bharat Aluminium Co. in one of the first tests of India’s efforts to offload state holdings.
He followed that up with the purchase of another government entity, Hindustan Zinc Ltd., and in 2007 successfully bid for what was India’s largest iron ore producer, Sesa Goa Ltd. In recent years, his commodities company acquired control of insolvent Electrosteel Steels Ltd. from its lenders.
The self-made billionaire also went abroad for investment. Until last year, he was the largest shareholder of  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc., triggering speculation that Agarwal was planning to push for a major change, such as a takeover or breakup. In the end, the tycoon decided to exit his investment as he said his returns were “achieved even sooner than expected.”
Agarwal’s Volcan Investments Ltd. took his London-listed Vedanta Resources private in 2018 as the entrepreneur sought to simplify the corporate structure of his resources group. This year, he proposed to buy the 49.9% stake in India-traded Vedanta Ltd. that he doesn’t own and delist the commodities giant.

377,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 05:54PM ET</span>",Democrats Weigh Next Steps After Trump Backs Bigger Stimulus,"(Bloomberg) -- Some House Democrats are keeping pressure on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to bring a new coronavirus relief bill up for a vote next week as they look to signal to voters that the party is pursuing a deal to bolster the economy.
Pelosi said Thursday that voting on some version of a Democratic stimulus bill is one of the options that’s been under discussion within the party to break the impasse with the White House and Senate Republicans.
Some Democrats want to vote again on the $3.4 trillion stimulus package the House passed in May, she said at a news conference, while some lawmakers don’t want to advance any legislation until they have an agreement with the Trump administration.
“Others will say let’s just put our own proposal on the floor,” Pelosi added.
Pelosi expressed confidence that Democrats are united in their approach that that she felt no pressure to change her strategy. “We are in a good place,” she said.
Swing district Democrats have privately pressed for a vote on a $2.2 trillion bill representing the current Democratic offer in negotiations, even if there is little chance of it getting through the Republican-controlled Senate. But Pelosi and other members of party leadership insist that no decision has been made on holding another vote without first reaching some kind of deal with Republicans.
President Donald Trump’s embrace on Wednesday of a bigger stimulus package than his administration had previously backed and that Senate Republican have said they’d go for has revived some hopes that a deal could be struck before the November election.
But there have been no new negotiations between Pelosi and the White House since talks broke off last month and many lawmakers remain skeptical that an agreement can be pulled off.
Trump said he liked “the larger numbers” in a compromise $1.5 trillion stimulus plan from a bipartisan group of House lawmakers even though many Republicans have dismissed as too big. Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer welcomed Trump’s shift while reinforcing their demand for a $2.2 trillion package.
“We have come down a trillion dollars” from the bill passed in May, Pelosi said. “It’s hard to see how you can go any lower when you only have a greater need.”
While Republicans such as Senators Roy Blunt of Missouri and John Cornyn of Texas have suggested the $1.5 trillion plan from the Problem Solvers Caucus could be the basis of a deal, many others said their wasn’t enough GOP support for that much spending.
“This used to be the White House versus Pelosi up until about now -- now the president’s coming in and saying we can maybe go to $1.5 trillion,” Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said Thursday in a Bloomberg TV interview. “He better be careful of that because I don’t think that will get through the United States Senate.”
Adding to the pressure is the calendar. The general election that will decide control of the White House and Congress is 47 days away. The House is scheduled to leave town Oct. 2 and the Senate the week after that.
There is restlessness in the White House and in both parties in Congress about facing voters with no additional boost for the economy.
Texas Democratic Representative Lloyd Doggett predicted the House would vote on a revised stimulus bill either the end of next week or the following week.
“We’re not going to go home without voting on something,” he said.
House Rules Chairman Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, said that lawmakers are mulling the idea of a new vote but leaders are still hoping to reach an agreement with the White House in the next few days.
“The president is motivated to get stimulus checks out with his name on it,” he said.

The discussions “covered a broad range of issues and some limited progress was made,” the government said in a statement late Thursday.
The positive noises from both sides contrast with the saber-rattling in recent days, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government introduced a draft law to Parliament that tore up sections of the Brexit deal he reached less than a year ago, and the EU threatened to retaliate with legal action.
How Johnson Is Risking U.K.’s Reputation, Trade Deals: QuickTake
Even so, the U.K. said “significant gaps remain in key areas, including fisheries and subsidies.”
The two sides are trying to reach a trade deal to take effect once Britain’s post-Brexit transition period closes at the end of the year. But they’ve become snarled over the U.K.’s desire to curb the access of EU fishing vessels to its waters, and over the so-called level-playing field -- in particular, what EU state aid rules the U.K. will have to follow after leaving the bloc.
“We will continue to work hard to bridge those gaps in talks next week, without compromising our fundamental position of being an independent country,” the U.K. said.
Von der Leyen told the FT that while Johnson’s decision to introduce legislation allowing his government to breach the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement struck between the two sides was “a very unpleasant surprise” and a “distraction,” the focus should remain on striking a trade deal. “I am still convinced it can be done,” she said.
Negotiators are trying to come to an agreement by mid-October in order to provide time for it to be ratified by year-end.

(Reuters) - Investors pulled $994 million out of U.S.-based stock funds in the week that ended Wednesday, according to Lipper data released on Thursday, adding another layer of selling during what is shaping up to be a rocky September in the stock market. 
The benchmark S&P 500 is down slightly more than 4% since the beginning of the month, pausing a rally that has pushed the index up approximately 50% since its March lows. Much of the decline has come in giant technology stocks that led the stock market to record highs despite the coronavirus pandemic. 
Investors instead continued to gravitate toward taxable bond funds, which attracted $7.0 billion during the 23rd straight weekly inflow. Bonds dipped Thursday, one day after the Federal Reserve said it expects to keep interest rates near zero until at least 2023 to allow inflation to rise in the economy.
Money mark funds shed $50.5 billion during the week, the 10th largest liquidation on record, while emerging market equity funds lost approximately $525 million.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Several Latin American countries have informed the World Health Organization (WHO) they intend to request more time to sign up for its global COVID-19 vaccine allocation plan known as COVAX, an official at the WHO's regional branch said on Thursday.
Countries have until midnight on Friday to formalize legally binding commitments to COVAX, a mechanism for pooled procurement and equitable distribution of eventual vaccines.
A representative for the GAVI Alliance, the COVAX secretariat, said by email that details of which nations have joined COVAX will only be made public after the deadline.
Health officials in Mexico, which has the worst outbreak in Latin America after Brazil, said their country would sign the commitment on time. Brazil, which has the world's most severe outbreak outside the United States and India, was still studying what to do, a ministry spokesperson said.
More than 170 countries have joined the global vaccine plan to help buy and distribute immunization shots for COVID-19 fairly around the world, WHO's director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Thursday. 
Jarbas Barbosa, assistant director of the Pan-American Health Organization, said in a briefing on Wednesday that Latin American countries were having trouble meeting the deadline and some wanted to push back the date.
Barbosa said all countries in the Americas except the United States had expressed interest in the vaccine facility, even those that have separate agreements with vaccine makers, because it gives them an added guarantee of access to doses.
Ten Latin American countries are among 90 poor nations in the world that will not have to pay for the vaccine, while the others in the region will pay an ""accessible"" price through COVAX, Barbosa said.

Colombian President Ivan Duque confirmed on Wednesday that his government was joining COVAX and Paraguay's health ministry said it has already signed, even as it plans to buy the vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) PLC and Oxford University.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a week when leading forecasters boosted their view of the U.S. economic recovery, data on retail store traffic, small business hiring and other high-frequency indicators largely worsened, signaling a potential decoupling in which growth presses ahead while the job market slows to a painful crawl.
Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday projected a much smaller economic hit from the COVID-19 pandemic than initially expected, with U.S. output forecast to fall 3.7% in 2020 instead of 6.5%, as was forecast in June, a difference in dollar terms of more than $1.5 trillion. That stronger outlook came alongside upgrades from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and others.
But Fed Chair Jerome Powell also said that restoring job markets will take time in an environment when some of the country's main job generators - small businesses and labor-intensive service-sector firms - face the stiffest challenges from the coronavirus-triggered recession. 
With parts of the economy showing steady recovery, measures of visits to retail outlets and other indicators dropped back after a Labor Day rush to stores and restaurants in early September.
Data from cellphone tracking firm Safegraph https://www.safegraph.com/dashboard/covid19-commerce-patterns, which estimated that retail traffic had nearly hit pre-pandemic levels over the holiday weekend, fell a full six percentage points last week. Similar data from Unacast https://www.unacast.com/covid19/covid-19-retail-impact-scoreboard also declined.

But there is concern the momentum of the recovery may be fading when it comes to employment even if the blow to output is smaller than first feared and some parts of the economy like housing are roaring back to pre-pandemic levels. 
Since the 1980s it has taken progressively longer after each U.S. recession to regain the jobs lost in the downturn, and by most measures this one involves an even deeper and more complex shock than other downturns.
Gross domestic product, the broadest measures of the value of the goods and services produced by people and companies, has tended to rebound more quickly, influenced by productivity, investment, and other factors.

This recovery has started fast, adding 10 million jobs in the four months from May through August, a pace that would restore the labor market to its February levels by early next year. But roughly 22 million jobs were lost, and many economists feel the easiest gains have likely been achieved.

Weekly new unemployment claims stuck above 800,000, roughly double that seen during the 2007-2009 recession, point to an ongoing problem.
With around 12.6 million people continuing to collect unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 5, ""the magnitude of regular continuing claims is dire,"" Indeed Hiring Lab economist AnnElizabeth Konkel wrote. ""COVID case clusters continue to pop up, and businesses continue to close doors, affecting the livelihood of millions. Until this cycle is broken, a complete economic recovery remains out of reach.""
With entire sectors like air travel and restaurant dining under pressure, companies reorganizing their work arrangements, and consumers changing their habits, ""it is just a very significant reordering,"" said Randall Kroszner, a former Fed governor who is now a deputy dean at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business. ""There is going to be an enormous reallocation within the labor market and that is going to take some time"" as workers shift from troubled sectors to expanding ones.
So far, between pandemic-related government lending and supplemental payments through programs like unemployment insurance, household incomes have been maintained.
That may not remain the case this fall. Much of that aid has expired, and data on retail sales in August showed an unexpected softness that some analysts fear is the start of a slowdown in spending that could push some businesses into bankruptcy.
Despite the recent upgrade to some estimates of GDP growth, others have shown little change.

385,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 02:06PM ET</span>",Fed's Powell sees a long road to 'maximum employment',"By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - The way Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sees it, the U.S. labor market has a long way to go to meet the central bank's maximum employment goal and a lot of boxes to tick along the way.
In his most extensive effort to explain how the Fed will measure progress toward a goal prioritized last month under the Fed's new framework, Powell was clear on Wednesday that he and other policymakers were not focused on any single number, such as the unemployment rate.
""Maximum employment is not something that can be reduced to a number the way inflation can,"" Powell told a news conference after the Fed announced its commitment to keep interest rates low until they are convinced of the job market's strength and that inflation is on track to run above the Fed's 2% goal for some time.
""It's a range of factors,"" he said. ""We're not looking at a rule. We're looking at a judgmental assessment.""
When asked if the Fed would like to return to the unemployment rate seen earlier this year, Powell said the Fed is not targeting a specific rate, but pointed out ""there was a lot to like about a 3.5% unemployment rate."" 
But Powell laid out a menu of factors - including wage growth, workforce participation and disparities in minority joblessness relative to whites - that must be satisfied before the Fed would view the economy at maximum employment, and thus even consider raising interest rates. 
""We would like to get back to a strong labor market where wages are moving up, where people can find work, where labor force participation is holding up nicely,"" Powell said. ""That’s what we’d really love to get back to."" 
But the Fed chief also said the central bank was limited in how much it could do to help close some of those gaps, suggesting it may be up to Congress to roll out policies that can help disadvantaged workers land jobs or help to address income inequality. 
Indeed, racial disparities persisted before the pandemic, even while those metrics were improving and pointing to a more inclusive workforce. For instance, as the overall unemployment rate first reached a record low of 3.5% in September 2019, the Black unemployment rate was still about twice as high as the white unemployment rate, a ratio that has persisted since the Labor Department began breaking out the Black unemployment rate in 1972. 
Another metric to watch will be the labor force participation rate, which increased slightly last year as more women entered the labor force. Labor force participation has started to recover after hitting a crisis low in April, but the gains have been slightly stronger for men than for women. 
Some labor market analysts note that women are more likely to take a career hit when they face challenges accessing child care. They question whether more women may drop out of the labor force during the crisis, suggesting the economy may take longer to return to prior levels of participation.
Nonetheless, the labor market is starting to improve, as seen by the drop in the unemployment rate to 8.4% from a coronavirus pandemic high of 14.7%, Powell said. The number of Americans filing initial claims for unemployment benefits also dropped from very high levels at the height of the crisis, he pointed out. 
Yet the number of people seeking jobless benefits for the first time each week is still about five times as high as it was before the pandemic, Powell said. It totaled a seasonally adjusted 860,000 for the week ended Sept. 12. 
""The overall picture is clear,"" Powell said 

""And that’s that the labor market has been recovering but that it’s a long way, a long way from maximum employment,"" he said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian interest rate curves steepened on Thursday to the highest in months, as traders priced in official rates being kept lower for longer and as growing uncertainty surrounding the government's fiscal outlook pushed up longer-term yields.
The shift, which reflects traders demanding higher premiums for lending to the Treasury, came a day after the central bank kept its benchmark Selic rate at a record low 2.00% and doubled down in its pledge not to raise it for a long time.
The difference between near- and longer-term rates rose to the widest since May, when the economy and markets were mired in the worst of the COVID-19 crisis. By many measures, these spreads are now close to breaching even these historic peaks.
""The central bank is not getting the kick out of forward guidance it expected. The problem lies more on the fiscal side than the monetary side,"" said Alexandre Schwartsman, former director of international affairs at the central bank.
""People are demanding higher risk premia in order to hold long-term debt instruments. Not because the market does not believe that the central bank will hold rates, but because fiscal risk is on the rise,"" Schwartsman said.
The difference between January 2022  and January 2027 (DIJF27) interest rate futures contracts rose on Thursday to 425 basis points, the highest since mid-May. 
(Graphic: Brazil rates curve - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegvbjyxyvq/22-27spread.png)
On Aug. 5, the day of the central bank's last policy meeting when it introduced its 'forward guidance' strategy, that spread was 345 basis points. 
On a broader measure, the Brazilian yield curve <0#BRBMK:> encompassing yields on three-month bills out to 10-year bonds was higher across all maturities on Thursday than it was the day after August's policy meeting, especially from three years out. 
(Graphic: Brazil rates curve - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgpdjkzwpo/BRAZILCURVE.png)
The Treasury has been reluctant to refinance debt at these higher yields, opting instead to issue more short-term and floating rate 'LFT' notes. 
This reduces funding costs in the short term because the official interest rates are at a record low. But it exposes the Treasury to any increase in the Selic rate and means it must go back to the market more often to meet long-term financing needs with short-term funding.
Essentially, this is a bet that the central bank will stick to its forward guidance pledge. But the Treasury is finding that investors are increasingly demanding higher compensation for short-term lending too.
The Treasury sold only 90.5 million reais of the 500 million reais of floating rate, three- and six-year 'LFT' notes at auction on Thursday, and will go back to the market on Friday.
This is by no means the first failed LFT auction this year. The Treasury's need for cash prompted the central bank last month to give it 325 billion reais in a special move allowed if there are ""severe liquidity restrictions"" in funding markets that make it difficult for the Treasury to borrow or pay debt. 
Treasury Secretary Bruno Funchal said at the time there had been a ""very significant increase"" in debt maturing in the next 12 months to 23% of the total, the main red flag of short-term financing risk. 
With Brazil's total debt stock exceeding 4 trillion reais, that would indicate more than 900 billion reais maturing in the next 12 months.
On top of the heavy refinancing load, the Treasury also has to fund a record budget deficit which the government pegs at 866 billion reais this year, and some private sector economists say will end up being closer to 1 trillion reais.
""The lack of response of markets to forward guidance reflects concerns about the fiscal outlook, as a meaningful deterioration could bring a weaker currency, inflationary pressures and the need to hike policy rates sooner than anticipated,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts wrote on Wednesday.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz plans to take on net new debt of nearly 100 billion euros ($118 billion) next year to fight the coronavirus pandemic, four people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
The plans underline an increased readiness in Berlin to boost borrowing after a source told Reuters earlier this month Scholz had initially eyed additional debt of at least 80 billion euros in his draft 2021 budget.
The pandemic plunged Europe's largest economy into its deepest recession on record in the first half of the year. Berlin unleashed an unprecedented array of rescue and stimulus measures, financed with record new borrowing of some 218 billion euros, to help companies and consumers through the crisis.
Scholz said in a Reuters interview last week he was planning to take on substantial debt also next year to finance further measures and sustain the recovery, but declined to give an exact figure.
Four people familiar with the draft budget said on condition of anonymity that Scholz was eyeing net new debt of at least 95 billion euros, but not more than 100 billion euros.
The step would require another suspension of Germany's constitutionally enshrined debt limits after Berlin already abandoned them this year. Scholz is determined to stick to the fiscal rules from 2022 onwards, which would allow net new debt but to a lesser extent.
The plans also highlight Scholz's determination to move Germany further away from its former image as Europe's austerity champion and secure Berlin's new role as the biggest spender in the euro zone's struggle to recover from the COVID-19 outbreak.
Otto Fricke from the opposition Free Democrats accused the coalition parties of delaying tough budget decisions due to the upcoming federal election next year.
""The rude awakening will come with the cash check in 2022"", Fricke said. ""But by then, Olaf Scholz will no longer be finance minister.""
Scholz is expected to present the 2021 draft budget and his debt plans after a cabinet meeting next Wednesday. Lawmakers will debate the package and have to approve it by December.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan has identified at least $600 million in taxes owed by companies under an ambitious drive to curb tax evasion, Finance Minister Mohamad Al Ississ told Reuters on Thursday.
The boost to revenues will help improve public finances and support the economy after the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic. Economists say rampant tax evasion has deprived the Jordanian government of billions of dollars over decades. 
""We are cutting tax evasion and going ruthlessly, with no red lines, against anybody who evades,"" Al Ississ said in an interview. 
The campaign to catch tax cheats, which began in earnest early this year, addresses longstanding public concerns and is part of a four-year $1.3 billion programme of structural reforms undertaken under International Monetary Fund supervision. 
Al Ississ said the tax proceeds would help offset a 17% year-on-year decline in revenues in the first half of the year, when the coronavirus pandemic halted much economic activity --especially tourism, a main source of foreign currency. 
Jordan's economy is set to shrink by around 5% this year, compared with an IMF estimate of around 2% growth prior to the health crisis, he said, but will rebound in 2021.
The government is targeting proceeds of over a billion dinars ($1.4 bln) from the tax drive this year -- more than a quarter of total tax revenues, which officials estimate will be between 3 and 4 billion dinars in 2020. 
Tax officials say the country's first such campaign has seen inspectors empowered by detailed audits swoop on hundreds of firms, including large companies that have dodged taxes for years.
The government has seized assets and pressured big corporations to strike deals to pay back millions owed, businessmen familiar with the situation have said. 
Al Ississ brushed aside criticism that the campaign has been used a means of settling scores and could deter investors, saying the proceeds meant the government could spend more on social safety nets for low earners. Rampant tax evasion had come largely at the expense of average Jordanians, he added.
""The tax burden has to be more fairly distributed, otherwise there will be no fair competition among businesses. It will improve the business climate, not the opposite.""
More importantly, it would boost fiscal stability and help the indebted country secure sustainable growth and recover faster from the impact of COVID-19, he said, adding that the IMF had signalled its confidence in Jordan's reform agenda. 
""Fiscal stability comes by enhancing your collection capacity from direct taxation through closing loopholes and fighting tax evasion. If not, we will be in very challenging situation, something I am not even interested in entertaining,"" Al Ississ said.

(Reuters) - The U.S. derivatives regulator on Thursday said it was backing away from a controversial proposal to delay the trade reporting of some swaps, after a number of market participants said that it would make it more costly and difficult to trade the contracts.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in April proposed that the reporting of block trades be delayed for 48 hours, compared with 15 minutes now. These trades comprise around one third of the $300 trillion U.S. swaps market.
But on Thursday Chairman Heath Tarbert said that the CFTC has dropped the proposal, adding that “public transparency is a bedrock of vibrant markets.”
Large banks have argued that a longer delay is needed for block trades so that information isn’t revealed to the market before they can hedge or offset the position.
But academics and asset managers including Citadel, Vanguard and T. Rowe Price said there was a lack of data supporting the notion that a reporting delay would improve market conditions.
Many also expressed concern it would make it harder to determine a fair price for swaps and make it more expensive for all but the largest market participants to trade.
Reduced transparency in swaps would also mean that other fixed income products that use swap prices as a reference would be more difficult to value.
T. Rowe Price said in its response to the proposed rule that swaps are used to help price many market indicators and indices including swap curves. “The long delays proposed by the Commission would make these indices much less reliable and accurate,” it said.
Interest rate swaps let parties exchange future interest payments to manage risk or bet on whether rates will rise or fall.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's standing in global markets is at risk once again after it moved this week to further restrict access to dollars as foreign reserves dry, a move analysts say will hit its much-needed economic revival and investor sentiment.
The central bank on Tuesday tightened the noose for dollar purchases, adding a 35% tax on people who tap a $200 monthly quota, and said card payments abroad would be included in the allowance. It also limited corporate access to foreign currency.
The move sparked a selloff of Argentine bonds and stocks, while the price of dollars in unofficial markets spiked, widening a large gap with the official rate. It also put Argentina's inclusion in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index at risk.
""It shows total desperation,"" said Agustín Monteverde, an economist at consultancy Massot Monteverde & Asociados in Buenos Aires. ""They have just hung a sign around their necks that says 'meltdown'.""
The tightened controls underscore how Argentina's left-leaning Peronist government is struggling to unwind interventionist policies that have long dogged the resource-rich country, despite sealing a major recent debt restructuring deal.
The central bank now finds itself in a precarious position, with net reserves having fallen to as low as $6.8 billion including holdings of gold, according to a J.P. Morgan estimate, despite capital controls put in place last year.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a note that the controls would ""buy some time,"" but the measures, together with the country's forecast for a deep 4.5% fiscal deficit in 2021, raised worrying signals.
""This is more evidence that authorities are not willing to address the fiscal and monetary imbalances driving the capital flight and reserves drain. And they weaken growth prospects.""
The South American nation is headed for a 12% economic contraction this year, which would mark the third straight year of recession, and is just emerging from its ninth sovereign default after restructuring nearly $110 billion in foreign currency debt.
It faces negotiations with the International Monetary Fund to delay more than $40 billion in payments due in the next few years. Investors said tighter controls could muddy those talks.
Capital controls have created a nearly 90% divergence between official and unofficial peso rates, while the central bank has been printing money to help support emergency government measures to battle the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
Meanwhile, dollar demand has remained high, with Argentines long wary about the stability of their currency and high inflation, and fearful of a repeat of the draconian measures of previous governments, including forced conversions of dollar deposits to pesos.
Central bank reserves are officially at $42.5 billion, though on net terms could be as low as $2.9 billion, excluding gold, J.P. Morgan calculates. That would be down from a comparable $10.1 billion at the end of last year.
'KICKING THE CAN'
Gustavo Ber, chief economist at consultancy Estudio Ber, said the tightened controls had a negative impact on traders.
""Within a climate of mistrust, these would-be measures do not resolve underlying imbalances, but can only stretch out the process of draining reserves over time,"" he said.
J.P. Morgan said in a note that it was matter of Argentina ""kicking the can down the road"". 
""In all, we see in these measures a temporary policy arrangement that does not tackle the factors behind the monetary disequilibrium, while jeopardizing the pace of an already timid activity recovery pace post-COVID-19.""
The measures will hurt companies' access to dollars in the official market for settling debt services, with the government looking to encourage firms to lower their debt loads in foreign currency.
President Alberto Fernández defended the measures, saying dollars should be for investment, not savings.
""We are building the logic of an economy that no longer promotes speculation and wants dollars to stop being a speculation tool,"" he said.
Some 3.9 million Argentines bought dollars in August in the official market, according to estimates from market operators. Many sold them immediately in informal markets, where they can turn a quick profit due a much high dollar valuation there.
Economists said the move dimmed hopes for a solid macroeconomic plan that would generate confidence in the country, lower pressure on the peso and lead to dollars coming back via investment.
""The government had two paths: to finally propose an economic program that would allow it to get out of capital controls and allow public accounts to be put in order, or a new very restrictive tourniquet,"" said Fausto Spotorno, an economist at the Orlando Ferreres & Asociados consultancy.

""The latter is what it has just done.""

The Treasury in a statement said it blacklisted Arch Consulting and Meamar Construction, two Lebanon-based companies it said were leveraged by Hezbollah to conceal money transfers to the group's own accounts, helping to enrich Hezbollah leadership.
Also hit with sanctions was Sultan Khalifah As’ad, who the Treasury said is a senior Hezbollah Executive Council official.
""Through Hizballah’s exploitation of the Lebanese economy and manipulation of corrupt Lebanese officials, companies associated with the terrorist organization are awarded government contracts,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement. 
""The United States remains committed to targeting Hizballah and its supporters as they corruptly abuse Lebanese resources to enrich their leaders while the Lebanese people suffer from inadequate services,"" he added.
The action freezes any U.S. assets of those blacklisted and generally bars Americans from dealing with them. Those than engage in certain transactions with those designated are also at risk of being hit with secondary sanctions, the Treasury said.
Thursday's move follows U.S. action this month that blacklisted two former government ministers over accusations they enabled Hezbollah as Washington warned that more actions targeting the group were coming.
Fifteen years after the assassination of Lebanon's Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, heavily armed group Hezbollah has risen to become the overarching power in a country that is now collapsing under a series of devastating crises.
Lebanon's banks are paralyzed, its currency has crashed and sectarian tensions are rising. On top of that, a huge port blast last month smashed a large swath of Beirut, killing more than 190 people and causing damage estimated at up to $4.6 billion.

393,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>",Pandemic upends emerging market investment thesis,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - The years-old trade of piling into emerging markets to capture higher returns afforded by faster growth may be losing its lustre, putting capital flows at risk as investors take a more nuanced approach to the asset class. 
Typically, the path of economic growth in emerging markets has remained detached from developed markets - outperforming during periods of strong global growth such as the years before and just after the 2008 global financial crisis.
That growth differential has also helped suck in trillions of dollars of capital flows, including $311 billion in 2019.
But the coronavirus pandemic is testing that thesis. China's economic recovery has roared ahead of most developed countries, but also of developing markets such as South America which is still grappling with high numbers of virus cases.
(Graphic: Out of sync: Activity indicators for China, other emerging markets and developed markets - https://graphics.reuters.com/EMERGING-MARKETS/qzjvqnjaapx/chart.png)
And even as economies begin to get back to normal, trend growth - already on a downward trajectory before the pandemic - could be eroded further as global supply chains suffer potentially irreparable hits. 
The Institute of International Finance said that while trade across emerging markets is starting to recover, limited social safety nets, healthcare capacity and less scope for aggressive macro policy easing meant in many ways they were facing tougher economic challenges than their developed peers.
Low interest rates and U.S. dollar weakness should be a push factor into emerging market debt and that has helped bring in fund inflows for the past 10 weeks, the longest streak since 2017. In the latest week through Sept. 9, inflows totalled $1.8 billion, according to EPFR Global.
But investors will still have to be on their toes.
""Given the uncertain and uneven growth recovery path, we think the differential will likely be pretty noisy in the near term,"" Ron Gray, emerging market strategist at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), said in emailed comments to Reuters. ""Over the longer term, we would point to the decrease in fiscal and monetary policy buffers as a headwind for EMs when needing to bounce back from future periods of stress.""
The breakdown in the EM vs. DM differential is evident in emerging assets. Chinese stocks outperformed developed markets year-to-date, while other emerging markets trail even further behind.
(Graphic: Three speed recovery for stocks - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdpzkqbgvw/Graphic2.PNG)
In credit, high-yield emerging market sovereigns have widened relative to U.S. high-yield, perhaps due to the U.S. Federal Reserve support for domestic bonds, Goldman Sachs said in a research note.
Emerging markets now ""sorely lacks a compelling impetus for investment"", Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) said this week, noting the tank was empty for the long bond trade as well as emerging currencies.
Analysts say all of this will translate into capital flows, which have been slow to rebound since the pandemic, being sluggish going forward.
Assuming emerging and developed markets grow in line with their potential rates of 2.8% and 1.4%, respectively, the former should post medium-term capital inflows of around 0.3% of GDP, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) forecast. That compares with the post financial crisis peak of 0.9% in 2011.
(Graphic: Growth differential between emerging and developed markets and capital flows to emerging markets excluding China - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxqdkgvx/Graph1.PNG)
DIVERSIFICATION
While the pandemic has upended the traditional approach to emerging market investment in the short term, increasing intra-emerging market trade has already weakened the relationship with developed markets in recent years.
China's share in the rest of emerging markets' total exports has tripled to 12% over the past two decades, JPMorgan said. Yet a decline in trade between emerging markets outside China and the United States highlighted a diminished role for developed markets in developing economies' external trade.
China's trade linkages with the U.S. will likely be further strained by the ongoing trade spat between the two countries, Luis Oganes, JPMorgan's global head of emerging markets research, told Reuters.
""The ongoing decoupling in trade and technology means that there will probably be growing divergence between the business cycles of China and the U.S.,"" said Oganes.
""That's why we're saying that growth differentials between EM and DM countries may not be the biggest appeal factor for capital flows to EM going forward, but there's going to be a diversification benefit of investing in EM given its deepening links to China that should still keep capital flows coming.""
Investors will increasingly have to be pickier, many predict, venturing beyond the popular equity, currency and bond indexes favoured by investors and the high-yield/investment grade split often used to manage allocations.
""The jobs of EM country analysts and EM investors will become more challenging in the years ahead since it is increasingly difficult to analyse EM as a single bloc and in order to capture the better opportunities we will all need to get into the individual EM country stories a lot more closely,"" said Oganes.
Goldman Sachs sees more profit upside in emerging market companies over their developed peers, said Gray.

""We still see opportunity in EM over the longer run but investors will likely have to be more selective on inter-EM themes like regional or sectoral differences as opposed to an outright EM vs DM view,"" he said.

The Business select committee said the government's Business department had prevented a witness from appearing in a session to discuss the government's $500 million purchase of a stake in OneWeb, which it made in July this year. 
Business Secretary Alok Sharma said in reply that he welcomed the scrutiny but as the transaction had not closed he did not want the commercial discussions to be affected. 
British governments have generally taken a hands-off approach to business but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to invest in technology and infrastructure to re-shape and re-energize the industrial sector as it leaves the European Union.
The committee had launched an investigation into whether this particular ""gamble"" was a good use of taxpayers money and to review where OneWeb fitted into the overall space strategy. 
OneWeb, founded in 2014, planned to launch 650 satellites into low earth orbit to provide universal internet access but was locked in a constant struggle to raise funds. 
It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy at the end of March after its biggest investor, SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), pulled funding, prompting Britain and India's Bharti Global to join forces to buy it at auction. 
Darren Jones, chair of the select committee, told a hearing on Thursday that the government had said it could not support the appearance of witness Tim Farrar from Telecom, Media and Finance Associates because he had advised on the deal. 
In a letter to Alok Sharma, Britain's business minister, he said: ""To be clear, you have no such power to authorise witnesses to my committee and it is a gross interference with the work of parliament for the government to intervene in this way.
""My committee is authorised by parliament to hold you, your colleagues and your department to account."" 
In his response Sharma suggested Farrar could take part in a confidential briefing or in a standard hearing when the transaction has concluded.

The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort monthly gauge advanced 3.5 percentage points to 41.5, according to the Sept. 1-14 survey released Thursday. Even with the gain, the expectations index is still 16 percentage points below the pre-pandemic level as millions of Americans continue to collect unemployment benefits.
At 29%, the share of respondents this month who said the economy was getting better rose 6 percentage points to the highest level since February. Still, 46% said conditions are getting worse.
Half of Republican respondents said the economy is improving, compared with just 15% of Democrats and 25% of political independents.
The weekly measure of consumer comfort was little changed at 47.7 in the latest period after rising the previous week to 47.8, the highest level since early April. The gauge of personal finances rose for a fourth week and was the strongest since late March.

396,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 10:05AM ET</span>",Bank of England looks harder at negative rates in case troubles deepen,"By Andy Bruce, David Milliken and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England said it was looking more closely at how it might cut interest rates below zero as Britain's economy faces a triple whammy of rising COVID-19 cases, higher unemployment and a possible new Brexit shock.
The BoE's monetary policymakers said the world's sixth-biggest economy was recovering faster than they had thought as recently as last month, and they voted unanimously to keep their main stimulus programmes on hold for now.
But the BoE said its Monetary Policy Committee had been briefed on how a negative Bank Rate ""could be implemented effectively, should the outlook for inflation and output warrant it at some point during this period of low equilibrium rates"".
Governor Andrew Bailey and some of his colleagues have previously said that they were looking at the pros and cons of following the lead of other central banks, including those in the euro zone and Japan, and taking rates negative.
The BoE said on Thursday that it would ""begin structured engagement on the operational considerations in 2020 Q4"", a sign that it would look at how to take rates below zero without hurting banks' ability to lend and damaging the recovery.
Sterling fell sharply after the announcement, weakening by around 0.6% on the day against the U.S. dollar  to below $1.29.
Britain suffered the biggest economic contraction among Group of Seven nations between April and June, slumping by 20%, and like other central banks around the world, it is studying how best to use its limited room for manoeuvre.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve promised to keep rates near zero percent until inflation is on track to ""moderately exceed"" its 2% inflation target ""for some time"".
Economists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said they still expected the BoE's next move to be an increase in the size of its bond-buying programme - which already stands at nearly $1 trillion - in November.
Negative rates were likely if Britain fails to get a trade deal with the European Union, they said. 
CLOUDS GATHERING 
The British central bank is gearing up for what looks like a tense seven weeks before its next policy meeting in November with coronavirus restrictions already tightening in many parts of the country and London and Brussels at loggerheads over a post-Brexit trade deal from Jan. 1.
On top of that, finance minister Rishi Sunak has ruled out extending his huge coronavirus job retention scheme which is due to expire on Oct. 31, although he has promised to be ""creative"" to keep people in work.
""Storm clouds are gathering with new social restrictions in place, the furlough scheme unwinding and Brexit rearing its head again,"" said Jon Hudson (NYSE:HUD), UK equities investment manager at Premier Miton. ""With inflation well below target, it's therefore unsurprising to see the MPC hinting at further stimulus in the coming months."" 
As expected, the BoE kept its benchmark interest rate at 0.1% and left unchanged the size of its bond-buying programme at 745 billion pounds ($966 billion).
Economists polled by Reuters had expected the BoE to hold steady at its September policy meeting.
The Monetary Policy Committee said the economy was likely to continue its recovery and be 7% below its end-2019 size in the third quarter. In August the BoE had said the economy would be 9% below its end-2019 level in Q3.
""Recent domestic economic data have been a little stronger than the Committee expected at the time of the August Report, although, given the risks, it is unclear how informative they are about how the economy will perform further out,"" it said.

397,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 09:36AM ET</span>",U.S. Housing Starts Fall More Than Forecast on Multifamily Drop,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. home starts fell more than forecast in August, reflecting less construction of apartments and a decline in the tropical storm-hit South, representing a pause in momentum for a housing market that’s been a key source of fuel for the economy.
Residential starts decreased 5.1%, to a 1.42 million annualized rate from a month earlier, according to a government report released Thursday. The decline follows a downwardly revised 17.9% surge in the prior month. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a 1.49 million pace in August.
Applications to build, a proxy for future construction, decreased 0.9%, reflecting fewer permits for multifamily housing, following a 17.9% surge in July that was the largest in 12 years. The 1.47 million rate of permits was below the median estimate for 1.51 million though it remains above the February pre-pandemic rate.
The unexpected dip in building permits “barely dents the massive increases that were racked up over the past three months,” Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note. “And note that the gap between starts and permits is positive again, pointing to more ground-building work (literally) ahead.”
An increase in starts of single-family housing and a stronger home-construction market than a year earlier are consistent with one of the best-performing areas of the economy. Firm demand, reflecting record-low interest rates and changing living preferences as a result of the pandemic, has propelled homebuilder sentiment to a record high.
Housing starts rose in two of four regions. In the South, new construction decreased, reflecting in part tropical storms along the Gulf Coast. A pickup in building permits in the region to the highest since February 2007, however, indicates homebuilding will firm in coming months. New construction advanced in the Midwest to an almost 14-year high and also climbed in the West.
The government’s retail sales report on Wednesday showed the secondary effects of the recent strength in housing. Spending at furniture and home furnishing outlets increased 3.8% in August from the prior year, while receipts at building materials stores were up 15.4%, according to the Commerce Department data.
The pace of strength in the housing market is nonetheless at risk of slowing if the broader economy weakens. Congress is yet to pass a new stimulus package to support small businesses and the unemployed, which could hurt family incomes and their ability to afford new homes.
A separate report Thursday showed the number of Americans applying for jobless benefits resumed its decline, signaling a gradual improvement in the battered labor market.
Stocks fell in early trading and Treasuries extended their rally as the jobless data showed a slowly improving economy.
Single-family housing starts rose to a 1.02 million annualized rate, the fastest since February. Multifamily starts, a category that tends to be volatile and includes apartment buildings and condominiums, dropped 22.7% to a 395,000 annualized pace, Thursday’s report showed.
Permits to build one-family units increased 6% to a 1.04 million annual rate, while the number of single-family projects authorized but not yet started rose to 99,000 in August, the most since the end of 2018.

398,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 09:06AM ET</span>",Explainer: Lebanon's financial meltdown and how it happened,"By Edmund Blair
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon is grappling with a deep economic crisis after successive governments piled up debt following the 1975-1990 civil war with little to show for their spending binge.
Banks, central to the service-oriented economy, are paralysed. Savers have been locked out of dollar accounts or told funds they can access are worth less. The currency has crashed, driving a swathe of the population into poverty.
WHERE DID IT GO WRONG?
Lebanon's financial collapse since 2019 is a story of how a vision for rebuilding a nation once known as the Switzerland of the Middle East was derailed by corruption and mismanagement as a sectarian elite borrowed with few restraints.
Downtown Beirut, levelled in the civil war, rose up with skyscrapers built by international architects and swanky shopping malls filled with designer boutiques that took payment in dollars.
But Lebanon had little else to show for a debt mountain equivalent to 150% of national output, one of the world's highest burdens. Its electricity plants can't keep the lights on and Lebanon's only reliable export is its human capital.
HOW DID IT BORROW SO MUCH?
Some economists have described Lebanon's financial system as a nationally regulated Ponzi scheme, where new money is borrowed to pay existing creditors. It works until fresh money runs out. But how did the nation of about 6 million people get there?
After the civil war, Lebanon balanced its books with tourism receipts, foreign aid, earnings from its financial industry and the largesse of Gulf Arab states, which bankrolled the state by bolstering central bank reserves.
Yet one of its most reliable sources of dollars was remittances from the millions of Lebanese who went abroad to find work. Even in the 2008 global financial crash, they sent cash home.
But remittances started slowing from 2011 as Lebanon's sectarian squabbling led to more political sclerosis and much of the Middle East, including neighbouring Syria, descended into chaos.
Sunni Muslim Gulf states turned away with the rising influence in Lebanon of Iran, via Hezbollah, a heavily armed Lebanese Shi'ite group whose political power has grown.
The budget deficit rocketed and the balance of payments sank deeper into the red, as transfers failed to match imports of everything from staple foods to flashy cars.
That was until 2016, when banks began offering remarkable interest rates for new deposits of dollars - an officially accepted currency in the dollarised economy - and even more extraordinary rates for Lebanese pound deposits.
Elsewhere in the world savers earned tiny returns.
Given the Lebanese pound had been pegged to the dollar at 1,500 for over two decades and could be freely exchanged at a bank or by a supermarket cashier, what was there to lose?
Dollars flowed again and banks could keep funding the spending binge.
HOW COULD BANKS OFFER SUCH HIGH RETURNS?
Lebanon was still politically dysfunctional. Rivalries left it without a president for most of 2016.
But the central bank, Banque du Liban, led by former Merrill Lynch banker Riad Salameh since 1993, introduced ""financial engineering"", a range of mechanisms that amounted to offering banks lavish returns for new dollars.
Improved dollar flows showed up in climbing foreign reserves. What was less obvious - and is now a point of contention - was a rise in liabilities. By some accounts, the central bank's assets are more than wiped out by what it owes, so it may be sitting on big losses.
Meanwhile, the cost of servicing Lebanon's debt surged to about a third or more of budget spending.
WHAT TRIGGERED THE COLLAPSE?
When the state needed to rein in spending, politicians splurged on a public sector pay rise before the 2018 election. And the government's failure to deliver reforms meant foreign donors held back billions of dollars in aid they had pledged.
The final spark for unrest came in October 2019 with a plan to tax WhatsApp calls. With a big diaspora and Lebanon's low tax regime skewed in favour of the rich, slapping a fee on the way many Lebanese kept in touch with relatives was disastrous.
Mass protests, driven by a disenchanted youth demanding wholesale change, erupted against a political elite, many of them aging warlords who thrived while others struggled.
Foreign exchange inflows dried up and dollars exited Lebanon. Banks no longer had enough dollars to pay depositors queuing outside, so they shut their doors.
The currency collapsed, sliding from 1,500 to the dollar to a street rate of as much as 8,000.
Compounding problems, an explosion on Aug. 4 at Beirut port killed about 190 people and caused billions of dollars of damage.
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
France is leading international efforts to push Lebanon to tackle corruption and implement other reforms demanded by donors. Crucially, Lebanon needs to resume stalled talks with the International Monetary Fund.
But politicians and bankers need to agree on the scale of the vast losses and what went wrong, so Lebanon can shift direction and stop living beyond its means.

399,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2020 08:55AM ET</span>",How Turkey's former central bankers would dodge a crisis,"By Nevzat Devranoglu and Jonathan Spicer
ANKARA (Reuters) - Veterans of Turkey's central bank have some advice for today's policymakers, who are on the frontlines of Ankara's unorthodox battle against a record-low lira and the economic impact of coronavirus: raise interest rates now and get back to basics. 
Four former policymakers, including a governor, told Reuters the bank must win back some credibility by moving to wrestle inflation down to target for the first time in nearly a decade. 
The first step in heading off a possible crisis, they said, is setting aside back-door policy tools and using a meeting next week to formally raise the benchmark policy rate. That could slow a 20% drop in the lira which has put it among this year's worst-performing currencies. 
Analysts say a rate hike is unlikely, especially given President Tayyip Erdogan's repeated calls for cheaper credit and the sacking last summer of the previous central bank chief for ignoring instructions.
Under new governor Murat Uysal, the bank slashed rates  to 8.25% from 24% in less than a year, and has held them there since May.
""The trend is going toward a one-man rule, so talking about central bank independence is absurd right now,"" said Bulent Gultekin, governor in 1993 and now a professor at The Wharton School in Philadelphia. 
""The central bank cannot alone reform overall Turkish economic policy. But in the meantime they can gain some time by raising rates to ensure, for now, there is no panic."" 
The bank did not immediately comment. Governor Uysal has previously said the bank has policy independence and that policy is in line with projections that inflation will soon start to slow.
(Graphic: Rate cuts left inflation lofty - https://graphics.reuters.com/TURKEY-ECONOMY/CENBANK/qmypmbnwlvr/chart.png)
EXTRAORDINARY TOOLS
Turkey's currency  touched an all-time low this week beyond 7.5 per U.S. dollar, keeping imports expensive and inflation near 12% despite a sharp economic slowdown due to the coronavirus.
Analysts say the selloff has laid bare the limits of Turkey's costly interventions in FX markets to stabilise the lira. They calculate the central bank and state banks have sold some $120 billion in dollars since last year. 
The interventions have played a role this year in nearly halving gross FX reserves at the central bank, which has also bought record amounts of government bonds to backstop Ankara's fiscal response to the pandemic. 
Hakan Kara, who was the bank's chief economist until last year, said extraordinary tools such as interventions and tweaks to required reserves have been over-used and are now blunted. 
""These should not be a substitute for the fundamental instrument, the policy rate,"" he said, adding the bank needs to ""break the spiral"" of confidence among citizens and investors. 
Only two of six economists polled by Reuters expect a rate hike next week, while they are split on whether one will come by year end. 
Uysal has said policy reflects expectations inflation will soon dip and that reserves naturally fluctuate. Finance Minister Berat Albayrak -- Erdogan's son-in-law -- has said the bank sometimes intervenes to stabilise the currency, and that exporters benefit from some depreciation.
(Graphic: Turkey's depleted buffer - https://graphics.reuters.com/TURKEY-ECONOMY/CENBANK/xegvbjnkzvq/chart.png) 
CRISIS WARNING
This month the lira has held mostly flat, thanks in part to indirect steps to tighten credit that have raised average funding costs  to 10.3% from 7.3% in two months. 
Yet last week ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said Turkey is headed toward a balance-of-payments crisis and noted the central bank's ""unsuccessful attempts to defend the lira"" have cut its buffer down to lows not seen in decades.
Fatih Ozatay, a central bank vice president from 2001-2006, said reserves would not be a problem if the lira were free-floating and economic policy was on the right track. 
""If there is a need for fixing, it is not only the duty of the central bank,"" he said. ""I'd prefer a direct increase in the policy rate instead of raising the average funding rate.""
Another former policymaker, Ibrahim Turhan, who has since helped found the opposition Future Party, said the competence and independence of the bank has eroded since 2016 when annual inflation last dipped below 7%, near its 5% target. 
""There can be no inflation without the central bank's permission,"" he said. ""It has to regain its independence before anything else.""

The WTO's trade barometer for services, which is published twice a year, fell to 95.6 points from the 96.8 reading reported in March. Readings below 100 indicate trade growth below medium-term trends.
""The barometer's measures are in aggregate outperforming recent trends in actual services trade, a gap that in the past has preceded a positive shift in trade momentum,"" the WTO said.
The WTO services trade barometer is a composite of data on purchasing manager indexes, financial transactions, IT services,
passenger flights, container shipping and building permits.
It is designed to identify turning points and gauge momentum in global trade growth rather than to provide a specific short-term forecast.
Passenger air travel was by far the heaviest hit sector, with a reading of 49.2 weighing on the overall index, although it too appeared to have stabilised recently.
The sub-indices for container shipping, construction, IT services and the global purchasing managers' index were all in the 90s. Only financial services, at 100.3, was around the mid-term trend this month.

The WTO said the volume of services trade fell by 4.3% in the first quarter of 2020 from a year earlier. This was not as sharp a drop as the 5.1% during the financial crisis in the first three months of 2009 and the 8.9% slump the following quarter.

LONDON/MILAN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The  London Stock Exchange  will review offers valuing Borsa Italiana at up to 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) at a Thursday board meeting, three sources familiar with the matter said.
The sale, dubbed ""Project Botticelli"", puts the Milan bourse at the centre of the latest shake-up in the European exchange sector, with non-binding bids from France's  Euronext  (PA:ENX), Switzerland's Six and Germany's Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn).
Sources said Six has made the highest offer for Borsa, which the LSE (L:LSE) bought in 2007 for 1.6 billion euros.
""The LSE is in no rush to take a decision. There are many stakeholders that LSE needs to please, including EU antitrust regulators and Italian lawmakers,"" one of the sources said.
The LSE, which declined to comment, is trying to sell Borsa Italiana as part of regulatory remedies needed to clear its $27 billion acquisition of data provider Refinitiv.
Refinitiv is 45% owned by  Thomson Reuters  (N:TRI) (TO:TRI), which is the parent company of Reuters News.
Euronext, which has made the lowest bid, has teamed up with Italian state-owned lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) whose backing is key to selling the deal to lawmakers in Rome.
'GOLDEN POWER'
Italy's Treasury can block any unwanted takeover of Borsa using its ""golden power"" legislation.
Rome is also keen to have a tight grip on Borsa's MTS platform, which is used for trading Italy's huge sovereign debt and is seen as being of strategic importance, sources have said.
Both Six and Deutsche Boerse are trying to lure Rome away from Euronext and have offered Italian officials guarantees on governance as well as representation on their respective boards.
In an interview with Corriere della Sera, Six CEO Jos Dijsselhof said it was ready to offer a governance structure that took into account Italy's interests in both Borsa and MTS.
Deutsche Boerse has offered to buy Borsa Italiana in tandem with Italian investors and would give Rome a seat on its supervisory board, sources have said.
The German exchange is prepared to enter a joint venture with Italian investors that could hold up to 49% of Borsa while Deutsche Boerse will have a controlling stake of about 51%.
It would also grant Italian investors majority control of MTS should the LSE decide to sell it separately.

Britain left the European Union in January and transition arrangements that still allow it unfettered access to the bloc end on Dec. 31.

The High Council for Financial Stability, which is headed by the finance minister and includes the central bank governor, stressed in particular risks related to clearing euro-denominated assets in London, which could only be overcome in the medium term by moving such operations to the EU.

ZURICH (Reuters) - The Facebook-backed (O:FB) Libra project has appointed former HSBC European head James Emmett to lead Libra's operational unit tasked with developing and operating the project's cryptocurrency payments system, the Libra Association said on Thursday.
The project has brought in a number of high-level hires since announcing a revamp and formally applying for a Swiss payments license in April, many of them specialised in financial compliance and with ties to U.S. government and authorities.
In May, Libra appointed HSBC's former chief legal officer Stuart Levey -- an erstwhile Under Secretary of the U.S. Treasury during the Bush and Obama Administrations -- to head the association overseeing the project.
Its Geneva-based governing body, the Libra Association, in April announced scaled-back plans for a cryptocurrency network linked to individual national currencies and overseen by global watchdogs -- a retreat from its original plans for a single coin backed by a basket of different currencies -- in hopes of winning regulatory approval.
Central banks and regulators had feared its original plan for a single coin backed by various currencies and government debt, unveiled in June 2019, could erode national control over money if adopted widely by Facebook's billions of users.
Emmett, who left HSBC earlier this year amid a strategy overhaul, will join the Libra Association's operating subsidiary, Libra Networks LLC, as managing director on Oct. 1.
Association head Levey, a former colleague of Emmett's at HSBC, said he was confident Emmett would ""help make Libra's vision a reality"".

Established in May 2019 as a Facebook subsidiary, ownership of Geneva-based Libra Networks LLC was transferred to the Libra Association in October 2019.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's Brexit negotiator told the bloc's 27 national envoys to Brussels that he still hoped a trade deal with Britain was possible, stressing that the coming days would be decisive, diplomatic sources with the bloc told Reuters.
Michel Barnier addressed the gathering on Wednesday and the three sources either participated in the discussion behind closed doors or were briefed on its content.
""Barnier still believes a deal is possible though the next days are key,"" said one of the EU diplomatic sources.
A second diplomat, asked what Barnier said on Wednesday and whether there was still a chance for a new agreement with the UK, said: ""The hope is still there.""
The first source said tentative concessions offered by the UK on fisheries - a key point of discord that has so far prevented agreement on a new EU-UK trade deal to kick in from 2021 - were ""a glimmer of hope"". 
Reuters reported exclusively on Tuesday that Britain has moved to break the deadlock despite that fact that publicly London has been threatening to breach the terms of its earlier divorce deal with the bloc. [nL8N2GD1LG
A third source, a senior EU diplomat, confirmed the UK offer but stressed it was not going far enough for the bloc to accept.
Brexit talks descended into fresh turmoil this month over Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plans to pass new domestic laws that would undercut London's earlier EU divorce deal, which is also aimed at protecting peace on the island of Ireland.
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden warned Britain that it must honour the Northern Irish peace deal as it extracts itself from the EU or there would be no U.S. trade deal for the United Kingdom.
The third EU source, who spoke under condition of anonymity, said that the bloc would take a more rigid line in demanding a solid dispute settlement mechanism in any new UK trade deal should Johnson press ahead with the Internal Market Bill.
""There is unease about what Britain is doing but Barnier has stressed he will keep negotiating until his last breath,"" said a fourth EU diplomat, highlighting the bloc's wariness about being assigned blame should the troubled process eventually fail. 
Asked about an estimate by Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) bank, which put at 80% the probability of the most damaging economic split at the end of the year without a new deal to carry forward trade and business ties between the EU and the UK, the person said:
""I would put it around the same mark.""

Barnier is due to meet his UK counterpart, David Frost, around 1400 GMT in Brussels on Thursday.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission recommended on Thursday that EU governments spend money from the 750 billion euro EU recovery package to boost the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic on green energy, transport and investment in digitalisation.
The recommendations come in guidelines issued to the 27-nation bloc on how to write up applications for cash from the recovery package so that the Commission, which will be in charge of reviewing them, can accept them.
""The guidance we are providing today aims to help Member States to prepare high quality national plans in line with our commonly agreed objectives. Not only so that funding can start flowing as swiftly as possible to support the recovery, but so that it can be a driver of truly transformational change,"" EU Economics Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said.
The Commission said it ""strongly encouraged"" EU governments to include in their plans investment and reforms in seven key areas the bloc wants to focus on.
These include clean energy technologies and acceleration of the development and use of renewable energy sources as well renovation to improve the energy efficiency of public and private buildings.
The EU also executive wants to see clean technologies in public transport, charging and refuelling stations for electric or hydrogen power cars and a fast roll out of broadband services and 5G mobile networks.
EU governments can also spend the cash on the digitalisation of public administration and services, including judicial and healthcare systems and on an increase in European industrial data cloud capacities and the development of the most powerful, cutting edge, and sustainable processors.
Finally the Commission would like to see investment in the adaptation of education systems to support digital skills and educational and vocational training for all ages.

EU governments can formally apply for grants and loans from the recovery package from the start of next year until the end of April, but the Commission would like them to send in their preliminary projects already from Oct 15th so that they can be discussed in advance to make sure they are accepted.

The 115 banks directly supervised by the ECB will be allowed to exclude some of their exposure to the central banks, including deposits, from the calculation of their leverage ratio until next June.
The ECB said this exclusion would raise the aggregate leverage ratio of 5.36% by about 0.3 percentage points, equal to some 73 billion euros based on the latest available data as of the end of March.
""The situation brought about by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected all euro area economies in an unprecedented and profound way,"" the ECB said.
""This situation has resulted in an ongoing need for a high degree of monetary policy accommodation, which in turn requires the undeterred functioning of the bank-based transmission channel of monetary policy."" 
The leverage ratio, which requires banks to hold capital worth 3% of their total exposure, will only become binding in July but banks are already required to disclose it. 

The ECB's banking supervision arm will have to take a new decision if it wishes to extend the relief beyond the end of June 2021, when the leverage ratio becomes binding.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - The Asia-Pacific region risks a damaging financial crisis from a surge of non-performing loans caused by rising insolvencies, a senior official from the World Bank Group's private sector arm said on Thursday.
In an interview with Reuters, Alfonso Garcia Mora, Vice President for Asia and the Pacific of the International Finance Corp (IFC), said bankruptcies were expected to rise by 30% because of the economic crisis caused by the new coronavirus pandemic.
While many firms have been given moratoriums on their loan repayments, many central banks are not requiring financial institutions to regularly monitor these firms' solvency. This, said Garcia Mora, was ""very dangerous"". 
""What can happen is that when the bank opens their books in six months, or in 12 months, they will realise that their non-performing loans ratio is not 2% but 20%,"" he said.
""This is why I am very concerned about the sequencing of this crisis. We started with a health care crisis, that's clear. We went into an economic crisis, and we might end up in a financial crisis.""
About 50% of firms will not have enough income to service their loans in the coming year, Garcia Mora said, citing an analysis by the World Bank and the Bank for International Settlements.
With a few exceptions, Garcia Mora said the region's judicial systems were unprepared for a leap in insolvency cases. There was also a lack of simplified methods for smaller firms to declare bankruptcy and start again, he said.
""We will have probably many zombie firms around that will not be able to liquidate,"" he said. ""There are other cases where we will need to liquidate firms that should not be liquidated.""
DIRE SITUATION
In its most recent forecasts in June, the World Bank estimated that the Asia-Pacific economy would contract by 0.5% in 2020, its lowest rate since 1967. 
Globally, the World Bank has estimated 100 million people to fall into ""extreme poverty"", where they earn $1.90 a day or less. About half of the newly poverty-stricken will come from the Asia-Pacific, mostly in South Asia, Garcia Mora said. 
""We are facing an extremely dire situation as far as youth unemployment is concerned,"" he said, with 10 million to 15 million youth jobs predicted to be lost across the Asia-Pacific.
Governments needed to use their ""limited fiscal space"" to target the most vulnerable; promote the digital and green economies; and reform sectors dominated by inefficient and heavily-subsidised state-owned enterprises.
""This is the time to open the market, to allow private participants to come, to allow all these new entrepreneurs to start coming into the economy,"" he said.
Without these reforms to state-owned enterprises, many of those who lost their jobs could end up in the informal economy, with little protections and low salaries.

The IFC has allocated more than $7 billion to boost the liquidity of businesses in the region for the fiscal year ending June 2021, with a focus on small and medium enterprises.

""Don't worry, wonderful & beautiful Alaska, there will be NO POLITICS in the Pebble Mine Review Process. I will do what is right for Alaska and our great Country!!!,"" Trump said in a tweet late on Wednesday. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the federal agency that regulates the development and dredging of wetlands, had last month placed an additional hurdle in front of the project to mine copper and gold, giving developers 90 days to explain how they would offset concerns about the environment.
Pebble Limited Partnership, the project's owner, at that time said it would satisfy the request for additional mitigation and that it would submit a plan ""within weeks.""
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not respond to a request for comment on the tweet from Trump.
The Trump administration in July proposed approving a permit for the mine near a salmon fishery, boosting the project the administration of former President Barack Obama tried to block on environmental grounds.

But a prominent group of Republicans, including Trump's son Donald Trump Jr., have publicly voiced opposition, saying the mine would destroy areas where they enjoy fishing and hunting.

SYDNEY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) said a seven-hour scenic flight over Australia's Outback and Great Barrier Reef had sold out in 10 minutes, as it joined a growing trend in Asia offering ""flights to nowhere"" that take off and land at the same airport.
Tough border restrictions to keep the coronavirus under control have led to a 97.5% plunge in international travel in the region, according to the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines.
Many frequent flyers miss getting on planes and airlines including Taiwan's EVA Airways Corp (TW:2618) and Japan's ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202), desperate for revenue and to keep their pilots' licences current, have offered special sightseeing flights. 
The Qantas flight, in a  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 787 typically used for long-haul international journeys, will fly at low levels over Uluru, the Great Barrier Reef and Sydney Harbour before landing back in Sydney.
Tickets cost between A$787 and A$3,787 ($575 and $2,765) depending on the seating class and the 134 available seats were quickly snapped up, a Qantas spokeswoman said on Thursday.
""It's probably the fastest selling flight in Qantas history,"" she said. ""People clearly miss travel and the experience of flying. If the demand is there, we’ll definitely look at doing more of these scenic flights while we all wait for borders to open.""
Taiwan's EVA used one of its iconic Hello Kitty livery planes for a special father's day flight last month, while ANA used an Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A380 that usually flies to Honolulu for a 90-minute flight with a Hawaiian experience on board.
Tickets costing $6,888 Taiwan dollars ($236) for a Tigerair Taiwan flight from Taipei that will circle over South Korea's Jeju Island reportedly sold out in four minutes. The price includes a one-year voucher for round-trip tickets from Taiwan to Korea, which can be used after COVID-19 travel bans are lifted.
Chen Shu Tze, 44, an engineer from Taipei, said she signed up for the flight because the voucher made it a good deal and she missed being able to travel - especially to South Korea, a favourite destination.
""The pandemic has a devasting impact on the tourism and airline industry, so I want to help boost the economy, and I miss flying,"" she told Reuters.
All of the countries where the flights are on offer have relatively low numbers of COVID-19 cases by global standards.
Among other airline stunts,  Thai Airways  International PCL (BK:THAI) this month opened a pop-up restaurant on the ground, offering in-flight meals served from airline seats to would-be travellers.
CLIMATE CONCERNS
Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) is also eyeing scenic flights from next month, the country's Straits Times newspaper reported on Sunday, an idea that received widespread criticism from environmentalists and online commenters. 
""First, it encourages carbon-intensive travel for no good reason and second, it is merely a stop-gap measure that distracts from the policy and value shifts necessary to mitigate the climate crisis,"" said awareness group SG Climate Rally. 
Singapore Airlines said it is considering several initiatives but no final decision has been made on whether to offer sightseeing flights.
Qantas said it would pay to offset the carbon emissions on its scenic flight from Sydney, though online critics noted that would not actually reduce emissions. 
The concept of scenic flights is not new. Antarctica Flights has chartered Qantas jets for scenic flights over Antarctica for 26 years. An Air New Zealand Ltd (NZ:AIR) sightseeing flight over Antarctica in 1979 crashed into Mount Erebus, killing all 257 people on board.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady on Thursday and slightly upgraded its view on the economy, suggesting that no immediate expansion of stimulus was needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
Markets are focusing on what BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will say at his post-meeting briefing on how the central bank could work with new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to support the economy with its dwindling policy tool-kit.
As widely expected, the BOJ maintained its -0.1% short-term interest rate target and a pledge to cap 10-year government bond yields around zero.
It also made no major tweaks to its asset-buying and lending programmes for easing corporate funding strains.
""Japan's economy remains in a severe state but has started to pick up as business activity gradually resumes,"" the BOJ said in a statement announcing its policy decision.
That was slightly more upbeat than its view at the previous rate review in July, when it said the economy was an ""extremely severe state.""
Suga became Japan's first new prime minister in nearly eight years on Wednesday, pledging to contain COVID-19 and push reforms after retaining about half of predecessor Shinzo Abe's lineup in his cabinet.
Analysts expect no major change to the relationship between the BOJ and an administration led by Suga who, as Abe's right-hand man, spearheaded the departing premier's strategy to revive the economy with bold monetary and fiscal measures.
""I'm interested to see what Kuroda may say about the BOJ's relationship with the new administration,"" said Masaki Kuwahara, senior economist at Nomura Securities.
""Probably Kuroda will play it safe and reiterate that it will continue easing, which as a result will have positive effects on policy mix between monetary and fiscal policies.""
Japan suffered its biggest economic slump on record in the second quarter as COVID-19 hit demand, reinforcing expectations inflation will remain well below the BOJ's 2% target for years.

The BOJ eased policy twice this year, mainly by ramping up asset buying and creating a lending scheme to channel money to ailing small firms to cushion the blow from the crisis.

The IMF executive board's decision came after completion of a third review of Angola's $3.7 billion, three-year program under the IMF's Extended Fund Facility approved in December 2018.
IMF Deputy Managing Director Antoinette Sayeh said the West African country should continue its efforts to reach a market-clearing exchange rate and advance restructuring of two public banks, and urged it to remain vigilant about public debt.
In a statement, Sayeh said there was little room for further monetary easing and the National Bank of Angola should stand ready to keep inflation in check.
Africa's second largest oil exporter has seen its debt-to-GDP ratio blow out to 120% with more than 90% of its debt denominated in hard currency, mostly U.S. dollars, according to calculations by ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO).
A 22% tumble of the kwanza currency  since the start of the year and a sharp decline in oil price, the country's main source of hard currency revenue, has ramped up the pressure on Angola and led to a sharp rise in inflation.
Data showed inflation jumped some 23% in July to late-2017 levels. 
""Timely implementation of banking sector recapitalization and restructuring is essential to address financial sector risks,"" Sayeh said, adding that authorities were preparing to address certain shortfalls identified during asset quality reviews.
She said structural reforms were critical to diversify the economy and lay the foundations for private sector-led growth. Further action is also needed to improve the business environment, strengthen governance and fight corruption, she said.
Around $1.5 billion has already been disbursed following two earlier reviews.
Early in September, the Paris Club of official creditors agreed to give Angola debt service relief until the end of 2020.

“We can’t allow the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit,” Biden said on Twitter. “Any trade deal between the U.S. and U.K. must be contingent upon respect for the Agreement and preventing the return of a hard border. Period.”
Biden’s intervention shows how Johnson’s proposal to unilaterally override the Brexit divorce treaty signed with the EU is having international repercussions, and making a transatlantic free-trade agreement politically more tricky. Biden shared a strongly-worded letter signed by four senior members of Congress, which urged Johnson to “abandon any and all legally questionable and unfair efforts” to breach its agreement with the EU.
“The United States Congress will not support any free trade agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom if the United Kingdom fails to preserve the gains of the Good Friday Agreement and broader peace process,” the letter said. “If these reported plans were to go forward, it would be difficult to see how these conditions could be met.”
What Trump, Johnson Want From U.S.-U.K. Trade Deal: QuickTake
Nevertheless, at a press conference with Britain’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, on Wednesday in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said trade talks with the U.K. were progressing well. He also said he backed the U.K. as a trustworthy partner, despite the row over Johnson’s plan to rip up the Brexit deal.
“I am confident they’ll get it right,” Pompeo said. “We know the complexity of the situation.”
The British government hasn’t put a firm timetable on securing a free-trade agreement with the U.S., which has been touted as a key post-Brexit prize. The U.S. is already the largest destination for British exports outside the EU, and trade between the two countries amounted to $270 billion in 2019. A free-trade agreement with the U.S. would be expected to boost Britain’s GDP by 0.16% over the long run, according to a U.K. government estimate published in March.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England is expected to signal on Thursday that it is getting ready to pump yet more stimulus into Britain's economy as it heads for a jump in unemployment and a possible Brexit shock.
The BoE has already cut interest rates to a record low 0.1% and ramped up its bond-buying programme to almost $1 trillion to soften the impact of the coronavirus shock.
It has enough firepower to keep buying bonds until the end of 2020, so investors are expecting only a signal of intent to do more at the end of its September meeting.
Anthony O'Brien, European rates and currency strategist at First State Investments, said one or two of the nine BoE monetary policymakers might vote for more bond buying as the BoE, like other central banks, turns warier about the outlook.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve promised to keep rates near zero until inflation is on track to ""moderately exceed"" its 2% inflation target ""for some time.""
""The tone of the minutes is likely to be dovish with downside risks becoming more prominent,"" O'Brien said.
Britain suffered the biggest economic contraction among Group of Seven nations between April and June, slumping by 20%. 
Monthly output by the end of July was 12% below its pre-COVID level, but the bounce-back is likely to slow as the government phases out its huge job protection scheme. At the same time, trade talks with the European Union risk collapse.
The next BoE's bond-buying expansion is expected in November. The Monetary Policy Committee member most likely to have voted for an increase this week is Michael Saunders, who has said it is ""quite likely"" that the economy will need more stimulus. 
Others have warned the economy could take longer to recover its pre-crisis size than the BoE's forecast of the end of 2021.
Only the central bank's chief economist, Andy Haldane, has sounded optimistic about the recovery.
Investors will watch for more clues in Thursday's statement about the chance of the BoE resorting to negative rates.

Governor Andrew Bailey and some of his colleagues have stressed that they are considering the lessons from other central banks, including those of the euro zone and Japan, of taking rates below zero.

""Go for the much higher numbers, Republicans, it all comes back to the USA anyway (one way or another!)"" Trump wrote on Twitter Wednesday. Later in the day he spoke favorably about a proposal for $1.5 trillion in aid made by a bipartisan group of centrist lawmakers.
""They're well on their way to suggesting some pretty good things,"" Trump said about the centrist plan during an evening press conference. ""I agree with a lot of it. The things I don't agree with, we can probably negotiate"".
Senate Republicans, whose last coronavirus aid offer was $300 billion and some of whom would prefer doing nothing more, reacted cautiously to Trump. 
But Democrats Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Chuck Schumer, the Senate Minority Leader, said in a joint statement they were encouraged and hoped White House negotiators would now ""meet us halfway.""
Pelosi spoke by phone on Wednesday to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has helped negotiate previous coronavirus aid packages. They talked about a government funding bill, and at the end of the conversation, Pelosi reiterated the points she had made in her statement with Schumer, Pelosi's spokesman said on Twitter.
The Washington standoff over coronavirus relief dates to mid-May, when the Democratic-majority House approved $3.4 trillion in new aid, including unemployment benefits, money for schools, the U.S. Postal Service, and testing. Pelosi meanwhile offered to drop the demand to about $2.2 trillion.
The Senate's Republican leaders countered with a $1 trillion plan, but some of their own members balked at that. Last week they put a $300 billion bill up for a vote that Democrats blocked as insufficient. 
Congress and the White House approved more than $3 trillion worth of coronavirus relief measures earlier this year. 
The Senate's number two Republican John Thune said on Wednesday proposals should stay in a ""realistic"" range. Noting the original $1 trillion Senate Republican plan, he said: ""As you go upwards from there you start ... losing Republican support pretty quickly.""
The $1.5 trillion compromise floated Tuesday by the House Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan centrist group, was attacked by members of both parties. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, however, said it deserved consideration.
The approaching elections increase the political stakes for Republicans and Democrats. Pelosi faces growing pressure from moderate House Democrats for more action on COVID-19 relief. Some of them welcomed Trump's tweet on Wednesday, including Representative Max Rose, from a competitive congressional district in Staten Island, New York. 
Rose said leaders of both parties should ""Stop the game, stop the stupidity and get to work"" on a coronavirus aid plan.
Several Senate Republicans said their recent $300 billion offer was about the right amount, signaling doubt they could go higher.

""So the president has his opinion, we have ours,"" Senator Ron Johnson said.

422,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 06:55PM ET</span>",Fed defends 'pedal to the metal' policy and is not fearful of asset bubbles ahead,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - One key investor takeaway from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's press conference on Wednesday: This central bank is not going to break a sweat fretting about future asset bubbles. 
The Fed launched unprecedented support when the coronavirus pandemic hit the United States earlier this year, slashing interest rates and unleashing asset purchases which has pushed bond yields to lows and sent equity prices to record highs. 
Still, Powell said the decade-long U.S. economic expansion, which ran prior to the pandemic hitting growth, had included both quantitative easing and low interest rates but was ""notable for the lack of the emergence of some sort of a financial bubble.""
""I don't know that the connection between asset purchases and financial stability is a particular tight one,"" Powell said in a press conference after the Fed concluded a two-day meeting. 
The central bank said Wednesday that it will continue to purchase $120 billion in government bonds each month in order to support the economy and does not expect to raise interest rates until at least 2023 in order to let some inflation build in the economy.
The central bank's balance sheet has remained steady at around $7 trillion since May as it has reduced some purchases of corporate bonds as spreads have tightened. Its balance sheet stood at approximately $4.29 trillion in the first week of March.
The Fed's policy closely resembles its approach following the 2008 financial crisis, which fueled rallies in assets ranging from equities to real estate, said Scott Kimball, portfolio manager of the BMO Core Plus Bond Fund. 
""The rally in the equity markets are the end result of a lot of actions that the Fed has taken along the way, and the Fed is acknowledging that the wealth effect of boosting risk assets is real but not a systematic risk,"" said Scott Kimball. 
The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 is up approximately 51% since its lows in March, bolstered in part by the U.S. central bank's $3 trillion stimulus plan and move to slash interest rates to essentially zero. The index now trades at a trailing price to earnings ratio of 27.2, nearly double its historical average of 16, according to Refinitiv data. 
""The Fed is telling investors that they are putting the monetary policy pedal to the metal,"" said Brian Jacobsen, multi-asset strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Funds, who said that he expects the U.S. equity market to continue to rally, though at a slower pace than the last six months. 
Still, there seemed to be some disappointment on Wednesday that the Fed had not gone further. There had been some hopes that the central bank was gearing up to extend the duration of its bond purchases, or ramp up asset purchases more generally, to keep longer bond yields lower and prevent an equity market correction. 
Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance said the Fed was ""nowhere near as dovish as many had thought"" with no extension of asset purchases, no increase in buying of longer-end bonds and no yield curve capping, which alongside a view that the Fed will let inflation run, pushed up longer-end yields and hurt equities, he said.
Benchmark 10-year Treasuries dipped, pushing yields up to 0.69% from 0.67% the day before, while the S&P 500 lost 0.46%. 30-year Treasuries also dipped, with yields rising to 1.46% from 1.43% the day before. 
Longer term, the Fed's announcement on Wednesday helps the trends that were already in place, investors said. 

""It underscores the idea that if you’re hoping to get some kind of yield in the bond market it is still many years down the road,"" said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial, adding that as a result ""it helps stocks look attractive on a relative basis.""

423,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 06:20PM ET</span>","Fed touts economic recovery, vows to keep interest rates low","By Ann Saphir and Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday vowed to keep interest rates near zero until inflation is on track to overshoot the U.S. central bank's 2% target, a bold new promise aimed at bringing millions of out-of-work Americans back to the labor market.
But the new guidance also marked the start of a vigorous monetary policy debate as the Fed shifts from a crisis-era focus on keeping markets afloat during the coronavirus pandemic to managing what it now sees as a steady, multi-year recovery. 
Underscoring the depth of disagreement, and the economic uncertainty that underlies it, the decision drew two dissents, one from a policymaker who thought it went too far, and the other from one who thought it didn't go far enough.
It was also the Fed's last policy decision before the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, delivering the winner a runway of low borrowing costs for years to come. All but one Fed policymaker saw rates staying at their near-zero level through 2022. Just four saw them higher than that in 2023.
""Effectively what we are saying is that rates will remain highly accommodative until the economy is far along in its recovery,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a news conference following the release of the policy statement and new economic projections.
The new promise to ""moderately exceed"" 2% inflation, he added, ""should be a very powerful statement in supporting economic activity.""
RECOVERY IS HERE
With about half of the U.S. jobs lost since the crisis now recouped, and consumer spending about three-quarters recovered, the economy has come farther and faster than most at the Fed had thought just a few months ago. 
The new economic projections showed policymakers now see the economy shrinking 3.7% this year, far less than the 6.5% decline they forecast in June. They see unemployment, which registered 8.4% in August, dropping to 7.6% by the end of the year.
The recovery ""is here, and it's well along,"" Powell said. 
And even as the virus continues to cause ""tremendous human and economic hardship,"" he said, ""we are learning to live with COVID, which still spreads,"" Powell said. Social distancing and the use of masks allowed much of the economy to regain ground lost in the second quarter, he said. That contraction was the worst suffered by the United States in the post-World War Two era. 
But with parts of the economy, like the travel and entertainment sectors, likely to take longer to revive, millions will still struggle to find work.
The recovery, Powell noted, is expected to slow, requiring continued support from further government spending and, he said, the Fed, which is continuing to debate further actions including a possibly faster pace of bond buying.
Or, as the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in the dry language of its statement after the end of its two-day meeting, ""The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals."" 
BOND PURCHASES
The Fed used its policy statement to begin to pivot from stabilizing financial markets to stimulating the economy, saying that it would keep its current government bond-buying at least at the current pace of $120 billion per month, in part to ensure ""accommodative"" financial conditions in the future.
The Fed's pledge to remain accommodating for the foreseeable future initially lifted stocks, but a return of selling in the technology sector left Wall Street largely lower by day's end. Yields on long-dated Treasury securities ticked higher, meanwhile, while the dollar ended the day little changed against major trading partner currencies.
The new economic projections show that the Fed does not expect inflation to breach the 2% target any time soon. 
Powell said the Fed ""is both confident and committed and determined"" to modestly overshooting 2% inflation, but added that it would take time. 
In pledging to keep rates low until inflation was moving above the target, to make up for years spent below it, the Fed reflected its new tilt towards stronger job growth, announced late last month after a nearly two-year review.
Both dissenters to the statement, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, took specific issue with the central bank's guidance that it would keep interest rates where they are ""until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with ... maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.""

Kaplan said he would have preferred to have ""greater flexibility"" once inflation and maximum employment were on track to reaching the Fed's goals, an easier hurdle to reach. Kashkari's dissent suggests he wanted a higher hurdle: for rates to stay where they are until core inflation - which often runs cooler than overall inflation - has reached 2% ""on a sustained basis.""

424,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 05:50PM ET</span>",Fed projections show smaller economic hit from virus in 2020,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve boosted its view of the American economy's recovery from the coronavirus crisis on Wednesday, projecting the pandemic will take a slightly smaller bite from the economy this year with three years of steady growth to follow. 
In new economic projections released along with the U.S. central bank's latest policy statement, Fed policymakers at the median see economic growth dropping by 3.7% this year, an improvement from the 6.5% drop projected in June.
Policymakers at the median also projected the unemployment rate will fall to 7.6% by the end of the year, well below the 9.3% jobless rate seen when Fed officials last issued projections in June.
The updated projections coincided with a shift in tone by the U.S. central bank and chair Jerome Powell that portrayed the country as gradually learning to accommodate a persistent health crisis and go about much of its business.
Things are by no means business as usual. Powell noted U.S. jobs markets are a ""long way"" from normal, and that large numbers of workers may be sidelined in industries like hospitality and leisure that face particular challenges in operating while the disease is still being spread. 
But Fed policymakers also took note that the formal jobless rate has fallen faster than initially expected. The median policymaker projection sees the unemployment rate at 5.5% by the end of 2021 and 4.6% by the end of 2022 -- still high compared with last year's record low levels but more in line with past U.S. experience.
Inflation is expected to remain below 2% until 2023. The Fed last month unveiled a new strategy that pledges to lift inflation above the 2% level to make up for years of undershooting that target.

426,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 05:18PM ET</span>",Food Exports From Australia Menaced by China Backlash and Virus,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s food exporters are facing a challenging year, with the value of shipments set to drop by 10%, as the country grapples with souring Chinese ties, shrinking meat sales and a virus-driven downturn in demand.
Government forecaster Abares expects agricultural exports to shrink to A$43.5 billion ($31.7 billion) as prices for many of its exports, including meat, wheat, barley and wine, slump because of the pandemic and Chinese trade restrictions.
Lower meat output, as rains spur farmers to retain cattle rather than slaughter them, is set to reduce the volume and value of exports, while rising grains production will offset the negative impact on shipments of lower prices.
Brewing Storm
Barley exports have been roiled by a demand hit unleashed by China’s decision to slap tariffs of more than 80% on the country’s shipments -- then bar imports from biggest shipper CBH Grain Pty, according to Abares’ September report.
“The Australian feed barley price is expected to fall to A$230 per ton, 17% below the world indicator price,” Abares said. The drop reflects the imposition of prohibitive tariffs on exports to China, it said.
Still, other markets are opening up as prices decline.
The biggest new market for barley has been Thailand, said IKON Commodities CEO Ole Houe. “Prior to this year we shipped less than 2% of our barley to Thailand,” or typically less than 100,000 tons, he said. “This year we have so far shipped well over 600,000 tons, and we may even get to 800,000 tons.”
Abares points to Asian and Middle Eastern markets including Japan and Saudi Arabia as potential buyers.
Wheat Boom
Wheat growers are also scrutinizing China, as its customs agency earlier this month put Australian exporters on notice that it will be stepping up inspections of shipments. It’s bad timing for farmers, with a 91% year-on-year increase in output expected from the coming harvest, following several years of drought.
Still, while the Asian country has been an increasingly big buyer of Australian wheat, it doesn’t dominate purchases. A free trade agreement with Indonesia that cuts feed grain tariffs is expected to bolster buying of wheat and barley.
Meat Minced
Meat production and exports are being curbed in Australia as producers hold back livestock to rebuild herds after years of drought.
Several meatworks have been banned from shipping to China, after alleged packaging and contamination violations, while Abares also cites Covid-19 sample testing at Chinese ports as “an additional downside risk” if the virus becomes widespread in Australia.
Still, other buyers are waiting to pick up any slack. “At the moment beef is finding a home in major export markets, with low supply helping to prop up prices,” said Mecardo analyst Angus Brown. “South Korea, Japan and the U.S. are the big three markets which will receive more beef if China takes less.”
Drinking Game
The value of Australian wine exports is forecast to decline as volumes and prices fall. Demand has taken a hit from Covid-related restaurant and hotel closings during shutdowns, though at-home consumption increased. Like grains and meat, the wine industry has been hurt by drought, with the 2020 grape crush the smallest in a decade, according to marketing body Wine Australia.
Another blow to the wine industry came last month when China announced twin anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations.
Meanwhile, for commodities as a whole, the coronavirus -- paired with a high level of exposure to China -- remains a constant threat. “The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the issues and risks that come with highly concentrated supply chains,” Abares said.

427,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 05:18PM ET</span>",Virus Cases at Workers’ Dorms Add to Singapore Construction Woes,"(Bloomberg) -- Singapore’s construction industry is bearing the brunt of ongoing virus cases at migrant worker dormitories, clouding the outlook for the city-state’s economy as it struggles to rebound.
Pockets of new infections continue to be detected in foreign-worker dorms, which had previously been declared cleared of the virus, and there have been some delays in getting routine virus testing completed. That’s resulted in a slower-than-anticipated return of workers to construction sites.
“We’d hoped to see more cranes swinging around and busier by September,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Banking in Singapore. “They are still taking baby steps to open up construction activities.”
The industry took a severe knock in the second quarter, when foreign-worker dorms were quarantined to curb the spread of the pandemic, with output plunging 59.3% from a year ago. The slow return of workers to their jobs means the government can’t bring forward public construction projects, which it typically does to give an immediate boost to economic growth, said Song.
Construction businesses like KTC Group are having to bear additional costs because of worker delays. When a project is postponed, it means the firm has to fork out extra money to extend the employment of other manpower such as field or site supervisors and the use of machinery, Chief Executive Officer Rajan Krishnan said.
“What you have is man and machinery idling on site,” he said. “Without the workers, work cannot be done.”
Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., estimates the construction industry will contract 36.5% this year, a record decline.
“We basically wrote off the construction sector for the whole of this year already,” said Ling, who sees the overall economy shrinking about 5.5% in 2020.
The industry contributed 3.7% to gross domestic product last year, so the economy’s recovery is more reliant on what happens in the services sector -- which makes up about two-thirds of GDP -- and manufacturing.
Retrenchments and unemployment rates have spiked this year, but remain below the highs of previous recessionary periods, including the global financial crisis. Even so, economists and government officials warn that there’s more job-market pain to come.
“We still think the labor economic indicators are going to slide from here, at least through the third quarter, if not to the end of the year,” Ling said.

Despite many private businesses struggling economically because of shutdowns or a drop in customers during the pandemic, the fund hasn’t seen a large take-up.
Currently banks that make the loans in the program, and subsequently sell 95% of each loan to the Fed, are applying the same underwriting standards that they would to their regular loans, Powell said. The Fed is working to make sure that banks understand the terms of the program clearly and that it’s meant for borrowers that don’t have access to borrowing under normal terms right now.
“We expect that they will do some underwriting; we also want them to take some risk, obviously because that was the point of it. The question is how do you dial that in? It’s not an easy thing to do,” Powell said in a press conference following the Fed’s September policy meeting on Wednesday. “We’re continuing to work to improve Main Street, to make it available pretty much to any company that needs it and can service a loan.”
Powell said the program has now bought about $2 billion in loans, which still represents just 0.3% of the total capacity of $600 billion.
He added that companies are not citing credit constraints as a top problem right now. The Fed is also constrained, under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, to only lending to solvent companies.
“For many borrowers, they’re in a situation where their business is still relatively shut down and they won’t be able to service a loan so they may need more fiscal support,” Powell said.

429,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>",Are higher Treasury yields coming? Options traders bet yes,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Options investors are positioning for rising Treasury yields, as improving data and rising hopes for a COVID-19 vaccine fuel bets on U.S. economic growth.
The average one-month put-call ratio on the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (O:TLT) stands near its highest level since the beginning of the year, according to data from Trade Alert, reflecting expectations that longer-dated bond prices will fall in coming months. Bond yields move inversely to prices. 
The bets stem from growing confidence among some investors that the nascent rebound in the U.S. economy will continue, diminishing the allure of longer-dated government bonds while boosting economically sensitive assets such as small-cap stocks, financials and industrials. 
A budding U.S. recovery ""is giving some asset allocators the idea that it's time to start nibbling at tremendously undervalued sectors,"" said Arnim Holzer, macro and correlation defense strategist at EAB Investment Group, who has recommended TLT puts to clients. ""It's a macro call on a reasonable economic outcome.""
In its policy statement on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve projected that it would keep rates near zero through at least 2023, as part of its efforts to help the economy recover from the damage caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic.
While that will likely keep yields on the shorter end of the curve anchored near historic lows, longer-dated bonds may be more susceptible to shifting expectations for inflation and economic growth. Longer-dated yields rose after the Fed's statement, in which it forecast a smaller shrinkage in U.S. GDP for 2020 than it had in June. The yield curve between 2-year and 10-year Treasuries (US2US10=RR) also steepened.
Yields on 30-year Treasuries last stood at 1.4518% on Wednesday, up from a record low of 0.702% in March, a move that has been partially driven by gains in the labor market and other evidence of economic healing as well as hopes that a breakthrough on a COVID-19 vaccine is close.
Some investors also see asymmetric risk in government bonds. The Federal Reserve's aversion to negative rates has left little upside in bond prices, said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. interest rates strategy at BofA Global Research. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s equity derivative strategists have recommended options strategies involving TLT puts.
By contrast, factors like a COVID-19 vaccine and additional U.S. fiscal stimulus could push yields higher, he said.
The bank's strategists also anticipate a rotation into value shares and away from the tech-related stocks that have led markets higher this year. They recommend an options strategy based on the small-cap iShares Russell 2000 ETF (P:IWM) outperforming the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (O:QQQ), which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NDX).
The QQQ has climbed 31% this year, while IWM has dropped 6%.
Rising TLT put activity may also be a hedge against a possible change in Fed policy should the recovery gather speed, said Michael Purves, chief executive of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. 
""Everyone is convinced that interest rates will be anchored to zero for eternity,"" he said. ""But if we get a vaccine and everything's heating up and it forces the Fed's hand to raise the Fed funds rate, that's going to spill over to the 10-year Treasury.""
The central bank's recent decision to allow periods of higher inflation also could pressure longer-dated bonds on expectations that rising consumer prices will erode their value. Recent U.S. economic data showed underlying inflation firming in August.
A steeper yield curve sets up favorable conditions for shares of U.S. banks, which are also benefiting from the vast amounts of debt being issued to support businesses and federal aid programs, said Holzer, of EAB Investment Group.
In addition to TLT puts, he has recommended clients buy calls on the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (P:XLF) in order to benefit from gains in financial stocks.

Banks' ""earnings potential could be better than people expect,"" Holzer said.

The government is now expecting the euro zone's second-biggest economy to contract 10% this year, compared with -11% previously, the sources said, citing economic forecasts to be included in the 2021 budget, due at the end of the month.
Next year the economy is expected to bounce back from its coronavirus-induced recession with an equally unprecedented 8% surge in growth, unchanged from a previous forecast.
France suffered one of the deepest downturns in Europe in the first half of this year as the government put the country under one of the continent's strictest lockdowns to contain the coronavirus outbreak.
President Emmanuel Macron's government has launched a 100-billion-euro ($118 billion) recovery plan to boost growth in 2021 and 2022, which accounted for 1.5 percentage points of the growth forecast next year, one of the sources said.
With its updated economic forecasts, the government now expects the public deficit to blow out to 10.2% of gross domestic product this year, less than the 11.4% expected previously because a shallower recession would translate into higher tax revenues.
Next year the shortfall between government spending and revenues was seen reduced to 6.7%. That was worse than the 5.5% deficit expected previously, due mainly to extra spending on the recovery plan and the health system, as well as tax breaks for firms that struggled during the lockdown.
By the end of 2021, French gross domestic product is still expected to be 2.7% smaller than in 2019, before the crisis, the sources said. The government has set a goal of fully recovering all lost ground by 2022.

MOBILE, Ala. (Reuters) - Hurricane Sally brought heavy winds and massive flooding as it landed on the U.S. Gulf Coast on Wednesday morning as a Category 2 hurricane, the latest in what has been a busy season of dangerous storms in the United States.
Some parts of the Gulf Coast have already been inundated with more than 18 inches of rain in the last 24 hours, with more precipitation expected throughout the day even as the storm's winds slow. Parts of Pensacola, Florida, were swamped with floods as high as five feet, the National Hurricane Center said. 
The region could see as much as 3 feet (90 cm) of rain, as the storm moved at a slow 4 mile-per-hour (7 km-per-hour) pace toward the Alabama-Florida border, similar to other recent U.S. storms that caused massive flooding and property damage. 
More than 500,000 homes and businesses were without power in Alabama and Florida early Wednesday, according to local utilities, with more outages expected.
Upon landfall at Gulf Shores, Alabama, winds were clocked at 105 mph (165 kph). At the Gulf State Park, a section of the pier broke, according to local media.
Officials across the South called on residents of low-lying areas to shelter away from rain and winds. 
In Pensacola, wind gusts clocked 77 mph (125 kph) on Wednesday, and images on social media showed major floods. One witness reported hailstorms in the city as well.
Winds were also strong in Mobile, Alabama, where windows shook downtown, and trees and power lines swayed. Dexter Hart, who lives near the city, relocated to a hotel in the area because his house is surrounded by trees. 
""It's scary right now,"" he said. ""It's been keeping me up all night.""
Sally is the 18th named storm in the Atlantic this year and the eighth of tropical storm or hurricane strength to hit the United States. Two other named storms have also recently formed in the Atlantic, and the hurricane season runs through the end of November. 
""We've only got one name left,"" said Jim Foerster, chief meteorologist at DTN, an energy, agriculture and weather data provider, referencing the procedure to name storms. ""That's going to happen here soon, Wilfred, and then we'll be into the Greek alphabet."" 
Damage from Sally is expected to reach $2 billion to $3 billion, said Chuck Watson of Enki Research, which tracks tropical storms and models the cost of their damage. That estimate could rise if the heaviest rainfall happens over land, Watson said.
Ports, schools and businesses were closed along the coast as Sally churned. As the storm track shifted east, ports along the Mississippi River were reopened to travel on Wednesday. But they were closed to vessel traffic from Biloxi, Mississippi, to Pascagoula, Florida.

Energy companies also shut more than a quarter of U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore oil and gas production, and some refiners halted or slowed operations.

The long-shot plan by a 50-member group of House Democrats and Republicans, which has a bigger total spending figure than the administration previously endorsed, is not a “showstopper,” Meadows said Wednesday on CNBC. It was previously panned by both Senate Republicans and House Democratic leaders.
President Donald Trump on Twitter Wednesday urged Republicans to accept a higher level of spending. Last week, the Senate GOP attempted to pass a bill providing $650 billion in new stimulus, which was blocked by Democrats for being insufficient to address the continuing Covid-19 crisis.
“Go for the much higher numbers, Republicans, it all comes back to the USA anyway (one way or another!),” Trump said.
The Problem Solvers Caucus plan was developed over six weeks with the knowledge of the White House and leadership from both parties. But the track record of bipartisan groupings of moderates in either the House or Senate to broker major deals has been poor in recent years.
The proposal offered compromises on the two thorniest issues in the stalled talks between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration. On aid to state and local governments, the group is backing about $500 billion, splitting the difference between the $915 billion sought by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the $150 billion put forward by the White House.
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer on Tuesday criticized the plan after it came out, saying Democrats should not agree to less than $2 trillion.
Asked about Trump’s comments Wednesday, Republican Senate Majority Whip John Thune said “I assume that means he wants to make a deal.”
Thune said $1.5 trillion would cause “ a lot of heartburn” for Senate Republicans, however.

The coronavirus outbreak had caused the city to lose $9 billion in revenue and forced a $7 billion cut to the city's annual budget, de Blasio told reporters.
The furloughs will save only about $1 million, the mayor said, but may serve as a useful symbol as he continues to negotiate with labor unions representing municipal employees over broader payroll savings.
""It was not a decision I made lightly,"" he told reporters. ""To have to do this is painful for them and their families, but it is the right thing to do at this moment in history.""
With the furloughs and other savings, the mayor's office budget this fiscal year will be 12% smaller than it was last year, de Blasio said, though he did not provide absolute totals.
The policy will affect 495 staff, the New York Times reported. De Blasio has warned he may have to lay off 22,000 city employees if savings cannot be found in the negotiations with the labor unions.

He is also seeking greater borrowing power from state lawmakers in Albany, New York state's capital, who have been resistant so far.

In draft conclusions for a summit on Sept. 24-25, the member states' leaders say they want European industry to be more competitive globally and to increase its autonomy and resilience. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the EU's dependence on Chinese components in the production of drugs, and concern is mounting that it is lagging the United States in the design and manufacture of batteries and in digital cloud storage.
The 27-nation bloc has set digital and green technologies as priorities, goals that were underlined in a ""state of the union"" speech on Wednesday by Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, the EU executive.
The bloc wants to finance the transformation to such technologies by using much of its 750-billion-euro ($890-dollar) fund for kick-starting the economy after the pandemic.
The draft conclusions - which could still be subject to change before the Brussels summit - show leaders would name the European Battery Alliance, the Internet of Things and Clean Hydrogen Alliance as projects for the EU to focus on. 
They will also call for the development of new industrial alliances, including on raw materials, micro-processors, telecommunication networks, low-carbon industries, and Industrial Clouds and Platforms.
The leaders will also declare they want ""a significant part"" of the 1.8 trillion euros that will be available to EU countries under the bloc's budget and recovery package over the next seven years to be invested in supercomputers and quantum computing, blockchain, human-centred Artificial Intelligence, microprocessors, 5G mobile networks or protection against cyber threats and secure communications.

438,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>","France says Lebanese depositors may not get all their cash, minutes show","BEIRUT (Reuters) - A French official has said it might be difficult for Lebanon's banks to prevent savers losing some of their deposits, according to the minutes of a meeting in which France outlined steps to help the crippled banking industry.
The comments were made during Sept. 10 talks in Paris between senior French officials and a delegation from the Association of Banks in Lebanon (ABL). Reuters reviewed a copy of the minutes, marked confidential.
France has taken the lead in international efforts to push Lebanon's fractious politicians to implement reforms needed to attract aid and ease a crisis that has paralysed the banking sector, shutting depositors out of most of their funds.
""While it is a matter of principle for the ABL that depositors should bear no losses, it may be difficult to defend this to the end. But this is a matter of negotiation,"" Pierre Duquesne, President Emmanuel Macron's envoy to coordinate international support for Lebanon, said, according to the minutes.
Lebanon's central bank and commercial bankers have sought to prevent a ""haircut"", or formal reduction in balances held on deposit accounts.
But savers with U.S. dollar accounts in Lebanon say they have already lost money as they cannot access funds or can only do so by exchanging into Lebanese pounds below market rates.
The Lebanese pound, which was pegged to the dollar for more than two decades, has crashed during the financial crisis.
The French Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment.
But a French diplomatic source said France was also pressing for an audit of Lebanon's central bank and the financial sector to be ""launched without delay in an effective manner.""
A senior Lebanese banker who participated in the talks told Reuters: ""We felt throughout our meetings with senior French officials dealing with the president's initiative, that they support a prosperous banking sector,"" 
According to the minutes, Duquesne listed other measures needed, including the swift implementation of capital controls and bank consolidation in a country with 64 banks controlled by 32 groups.
On restructuring Lebanon's mountain of foreign and internal debt, Duquesne said a range of actions was needed. ""There is no miracle solution,"" he said.
The Lebanese banking group's representatives, including the association's head Salim Sfeir, said banks were ready to join ""collective efforts"" to resolve the crisis and outlined proposals that included their backing for a fund to mobilise state assets, the minutes showed.

439,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Italy's Recovery Fund windfall: panacea or poisoned chalice?,"By Gavin Jones and Giuseppe Fonte
ROME (Reuters) - Italy, the euro zone's third largest but most chronically sluggish economy, will soon get a windfall that could transform its fortunes - not necessarily for the better.
As the biggest beneficiary of the European Union's 750 billion euro ($890 billion) Recovery Fund, Rome believes the cash will help it fix entrenched economic problems and close its decades-old growth gap with the rest of the bloc.
Italy estimates it will get some 209 billion euros from the fund designed to help the European nations hardest hit by the coronavirus. The precise amount for each country has yet to be decided, but there is no doubt Rome's current generation of political leaders will have more to spend than just about any before them.
""It's an incredible sum, a historic opportunity and a huge responsibility,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told reporters last week.
If Rome can invest the money well, it could upgrade the country's dilapidated transport and internet infrastructures and eventually lead to a greener, more dynamic economy.
But Italy has a poor track record on productive investment and use of EU funds and if Rome misspends the cash, of which about 60% will be in cheap loans, it will merely add to an already towering public debt and raise the risk of default.
In a paper published on Wednesday the government said the reforms to be financed by the Recovery Fund could help Italy double its growth rate, narrow its north-south divide and even increase its birth rate - one of the lowest in the world.
Yet Rome may be building its hopes too high. Many of its problems that have stunted productivity and growth in recent years - from a stifling bureaucracy to a snail's-paced justice system - have little to do with a lack of cash.
""The insufficient rates of productivity we have accumulated can't be fixed by monetary policy or higher spending,"" Bank of Italy economist Fabrizio Balassone warned parliament this month.
Even before the coronavirus crisis, the Italian economy had barely grown since the start of the monetary union two decades ago. The current deep recession means that at the end of this year its inflation-adjusted gross domestic product will be smaller than it was in 1998, according to Bank of Italy projections.(Graphic:https://reut.rs/2UQ94Kq)
UNSPENT EU FUNDS
The European Commission will issue guidelines this week on the type of projects eligible for Recovery Fund financing and has already cited clean energy and digitalisation among top priorities.
Italy's ministries have come up with 557 preliminary ideas, costing almost 680 billion euros, more than three times what the country will get. Among them are developing hydrogen-powered vehicles, new fire-fighting technology, digital laboratories, better olive presses and numerous new rail lines.
Producing such broad-brush plans is easy, but Italy will need to dramatically raise its game in terms of using EU financing to actually develop and complete projects.
Between 2014 and 2020 it managed to spend just 40% of the funds allocated to projects approved and co-financed by the EU, Commission data shows, coming 24th of the 28 nations measured.
Former Economy Minister Giovanni Tria has criticised the government for failing to draw up a clear blueprint of its own, similar to a 100-billon-euro recovery plan launched earlier this month by France.
He says Conte is going about things the wrong way, seeking ideas for a hotch-potch of projects to obtain the EU funds, rather than starting with a coherent plan and then asking for the money to help finance it.
Conte points out that Italy has at least until January to present a detailed plan to Brussels.
DEBT RISK
The EU has still to clarify some features of the Recovery Fund, including exactly how much each country will receive. What is known is that it will be disbursed between 2021 and 2023 in instalments dependent on governments reaching milestones and meeting benchmarks.
This aspect barely features in public debate in Italy, which often portrays a rosy vision of easy handouts.
An estimated 81 billion euro in grants from the fund will translate into a net inflow of about 46 billion euros when Italy's contributions to the fund are factored in, Rome's budget watchdog calculates.
Moreover, the roughly 127 billion euros of loans Italy expects will add to a 2.5 trillion-euro public debt, already projected at 158% of GDP this year, the second highest ratio in the euro zone behind Greece.
With the interest on the loans expected to be negligible or negative, the government bets a combination of savings on annual debt servicing costs and higher economic growth will help lower the debt as a proportion of GDP.
But if growth fails to improve, the loans will just push up the debt up by another 5%, undermining market confidence.
""There is an enormous risk we will be unable to spend this money or we'll spend it on useless things, and in that case we are heading for a debt crisis in a few years,"" said Roberto Perotti, economics professor at Milan's Bocconi University.

""I don't think it changes too much about the broader story. It's still a story of there's very soft price pressures. It's still a story of there's a lot of slack in the economy, so I don't think it changes too much about the way we think about the economy.""

""Total CPI remains well below the BoC's 1 to 3% target band while the core measures have continued to track under the 2% midpoint of that band - consistent with the low for longest outlook for the BoC.""  
DEREK HOLT, VICE PRESIDENT, CAPITAL MARKETS ECONOMICS AT BANK OF NOVA SCOTIA:
""It's (the average of the core measures) been tracking around 1.6, 1.7 for several months now, so I think (the Bank of Canada is) still of the view that spare capacity and the pandemic shock will have lagging influences longer than a few months, so they'll still be cautious."" 
NATHAN JANZEN, SENIOR ECONOMIST AT ROYAL BANK OF CANADA: 
""The headline numbers are still soft but the core measures are kind of holding in there. The Bank of Canada's measures of underlying price trend have ticked up a little bit so I think we haven't seen as much softness there yet as we would have expected given how weak the economy is.""

""From our perspective, price growth is still running below trend, we still have the economy running well below capacity, the unemployment rate is still over 10%, so the Bank of Canada's focus isn't going to be on inflation for a while.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Emerging market central banks could risk their reputations, sovereign credit ratings and even full-blown economic crises if their bond buying is pursued beyond the coronavirus crisis, S&P Global said in a report.
Top S&P analysts said in Wednesday's report that although there was no indication that investors had lost faith in the central banks of India, Indonesia or the Philippines, risks would rise if post-pandemic sovereign debt purchases looked likely.
""Pushed too far... the programmes may impair the ability of central banks to respond to future crises, with rating implications for the respective sovereigns,"" the report said.
""If investors begin to view government reliance on central bank funding as a long-term, structural feature of the economy, these monetary authorities could lose credibility.""
S&P's concern is also that the buying is not guided by inflation controlling objectives, but by worries a COVID-19 debt issuance surge will hit borrowing costs and currencies.
""Sovereigns with less credible public institutions and less monetary, exchange rate and fiscal flexibility have less capacity to monetise fiscal deficits without running the risk of higher inflation,"" the analysts said.
""This may trigger large capital outflows, devaluing the currency and prompting domestic interest rates to rise, as seen in Argentina over parts of the past decade.""
S&P has downgraded more than 50 government ratings since the coronavirus pandemic took hold, while debt levels are set to continue to spiral.
Indonesia's central bank has come under particular scrutiny in recent weeks over proposals to give government ministers voting rights at its meetings and allow the bank to use the tactic of buying government bonds direct, rather than in secondary markets as most central banks do.
BI has also pledged to buy $28 billion of government bonds while relinquishing interest payments, as part of a $40 billion fiscal financing deal with the government to fight the health crisis in 2020, though President Joko Widodo has pledged it will remain independent.
Meanwhile, the Philippines has said it will carry out its 300 billion Philippine peso ($6.2 billion) government bond repurchase agreement with the country's Treasury Bureau for six months at most.
""The relatively mild market impact of central bank purchases of government bonds in these countries could change if the institutions increased their purchases, or if investors no longer saw the buying as temporary,"" S&P said.

442,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 08:40AM ET</span>",Hong Kong formally objects to U.S. demand for 'Made in China' export label,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong has filed a formal objection with the United States over its demand for ""Made in China"" labels on goods exported from the Chinese semi-autonomous city, the commerce secretary said on Wednesday.
Washington's move last month followed China's imposition of a national security law on the former British colony and a U.S. decision to end a special status that had allowed Hong Kong different treatment from the rest of China.
Now Hong Kong authorities find themselves in a bind over having had to reject the ""Made in China"" label at a time when they are cracking down on activists opposing China and the city's pro-Beijing government.
Commerce Secretary Edward Yau said he formally asked the U.S. consulate to relay Hong Kong's request for withdrawal of the new regulations to U.S. trade officials. 
""Such regulations go contrary to WTO (World Trade Organization) regulations and infringe upon our rights as a separate customs region,"" Yau told reporters. ""We are a separate, and indeed, independent member of the WTO.""
Yau, who first complained about Washington's move in August, said Hong Kong reserved the right to seek dispute settlement at the WTO.
The comments come a day after the WTO ruled that additional tariffs imposed by the United States against China in 2018 were inconsistent with global trading rules.
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a one country, two systems agreement that promised it a high degree of autonomy for 50 years. 
Many credit its unbridled capitalism, guarantees of a wide range of rights and freedoms, and independent legal system with helping Hong Kong to prosper as a global financial hub and interface for China and the world. 
But critics say the new security law, targeting activities that Beijing considers to be subversion, secessionism, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces, effectively brings Hong Kong closer to China's authoritarian system.
Supporters of the law say it will bring stability after a year of anti-government protests.

The United States has extended until Nov. 9 its enforcement deadline on the ""Made in China"" label, from Sept. 25 previously.

443,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 08:35AM ET</span>",'Don't do it': studies flash sub-zero rate warnings to central banks,"By Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - Six years after the ECB cut interest rates below 0%, behavioural finance gurus have a message for other central banks thinking about taking the plunge: don't.
Rates in the United States, Britain, Norway, Australia, New Zealand, Israel and Canada are at or below 0.25%, so chances are one or more of their central banks will go sub-zero to try and counter the pandemic-fuelled economic funk. 
Money markets are pricing in the Bank of England making the move in 2021 while New Zealand's central bank has already asked banks to prepare for negative rates.
New studies however seem to reinforce what some policymakers have long feared -- negative rates are ineffectual and perhaps even counterproductive.
""If your goal is to motivate people to take on more leverage (debt) and to increase investments in risky assets, then zero interest rates are actually more efficient than negative rates,"" said Lior David-Pur, head of Israel's state debt management unit.
David-Pur co-authored a paper published last month in the Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Economics, which found the highest positive impact on risk-taking and borrowing behaviour was achieved when rates fell from 1% to 0%.
That is more or less in line with cuts made by central banks from the United States to Australia this year.
The study, a rare look into consumer reactions to negative rates, tracked the investment decisions of 205 university students studying economics who were divided into four groups, each with 10,000 Israeli shekels ($2,921) to allocate between risk-free bank deposits and risky assets such as stocks. 
Interest rates ranged from 2% to minus 1% but were then cut by 1 percentage point. Participants were then asked how much more money, if any, they wanted to borrow to invest.
David-Pur said the group for which rates fell to minus 1%, actually cut leverage by 1.75%. But willingness to borrow rose by 20% in the group that saw rates fall to 0%.
""The number 0% itself had special meaning for people,"" said David-Pur, noting that once rates go negative, leverage -- borrowing to invest -- falls.
That's because negative rates can suggest ""some kind of emergency situation,"" said Anatoli Annenkov, a former ECB economist who now works at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY). 
""That per se suggests that you won't get the impact you want because people might just save more money instead of spending.""
Indeed, savings rates across the euro zone dipped briefly after 2014, then continued to rise as official rates fell further below 0%. 
BEEN THERE, DONE THAT
Detractors have long noted that neither inflation nor growth have rebounded in the euro area and Japan after years of negative rates. 
Fredrik N G Andersson, associate professor at the Lund School of Economics and Management, said the cost of negative rates for Sweden's economy likely outweighed the benefits.
Sweden last year lifted its main rate back to 0%.
Andersson, who has researched the subject in detail, said borrowing did rise when rates were negative but money ended up invested mostly in housing, inflating property markets and household debt. 
""It's not like you borrow and you buy a car or something that adds to GDP. When you borrow to buy housing, you don't get that stimulus effect,"" he said. 
Business owners had held off investing, he added, echoing Annenkov's view that the negative rates had been seen as a sign of crisis. 
BANK CHARGES? 
Another experiment at Germany's University of Münster found the risk-taking behaviour of over 300 volunteer ""investors"" was likely to change if they saw risk-free rates turn negative, for example on bank deposits.
While banks in negative-rate economies rarely charge depositors, Münster University associate professor, Hannes Mohrschladt, said that could happen if the ECB cuts rates further.
But he warned the ECB should beware of rate cuts that ""might increase prices in stock and real estate markets even further"". 
Lund's Andersson said evidence suggests central banks do not need negative rates to spur growth.

""I would say don't do it. It's not worth it.""

445,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 06:49AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday, September 16th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- It's Fed day, and Chairman Jerome Powell will have to explain his colleagues' decisions in the immediate aftermath of what are expected to be weak retail sales numbers for August. Snowflake's strong IPO keeps stock market sentiment buoyant. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) gets a double-whammy from the FTC and Kim Kardashian. Yoshihide Suga is Japan's new prime minister but he's expected to continue most of the old one's policies. The EU is going even greener, at a price, and oil prices rebound after a big drop in U.S. inventories catches the market on the wrong foot. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, September 15th.
1. Fed meeting concludes, with retail sales slowdown in focus
The Federal Reserve wraps up its regular two-day policy meeting, with the publication of its post-meeting statement at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT), and Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference half an hour, as usual.
No policy changes are expected, but the Fed will update its economic forecasts, including a first forecast for 2023.  Powell is also likely to be pressed on how he intends to sustain a recovery in inflation, against a backdrop of high unemployment and depressed consumer spending.
Before Powell’s press conference, the U.S. will release its August retail sales numbers, the first since the enhanced unemployment benefits scheme expired without replacement at the end of July. Sales growth is expected to slow to 1.0% on the month from 1.2% in July.
2. Yen hits two-month high as Suga takes over as PM
The yen rose to its highest since July as Yoshihide Suga was confirmed at the new Prime Minister of Japan.
By 6:30 AM ET, the dollar was down 0.4% at 105.05 yen.
Suga has promised economic reform, but as a 71 year-old who served for a long time under his predecessor Shinzo Abe, most analysts expect a continuation of most of Abe’s policies.
The yen’s strength is in part tied to the general recovery in the Asian-Pacific economy that is being driven by China. The yuan hit a new 16-month high overnight, while the Taiwanese dollar and Korean won have also strengthened. The yen’s rise is also due to the general weakness in the dollar since Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced the Fed would adopt a higher tolerance of inflation in future, analysts say.
3. Stocks set to extend gains as Snowflake keeps the mood buoyant; double-whammy for Facebook 
U.S. stock markets show no sign of letting the Fed meeting get in the way of a strong rebound after last week’s volatility. They’re set to open up for a third straight day, with all three major index futures advancing roughly in line, after a strong IPO pricing for cloud software company Snowflake.
By 6:30 AM, the Dow 30 futures contract was up 136 points, or 0.5%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract and NASDAQ Futures were up 0.6%.
That’s despite some notable single-stock losses: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock was marked down 1.4% after a report that the Federal Trade Commission is preparing an antitrust investigation, which in turn followed news of a mass boycott of its Instagram platform by Kim Kardashian and other high-profile celebrities and influencers.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock was indicated down 0.1% after a damning House report into the 737 MAX sharply criticized it for cutting corners in getting the aircraft certified.
4. Europe tightens the screws on fossil fuels
The European Union’s top bureaucrat unveiled plans to cut carbon dioxide emissions further and faster than planned in a keynote ‘state of the union’ speech that laid out how Europe should recover from the pandemic.
The EU is now targeting a 55% reduction in CO2 emissions from the 1990 baseline by 2030, rather than the 40% cut previously targeted. That means a more aggressive timetable for phasing out fossil fuels from the electricity and transportation value chains, and, almost certainly, higher prices in Europe’s Carbon Emissions trading program.
Stricter environmental rules are also a likely precursor to attempts to impose a Carbon Border Tax on imports in the longer term, a way of tying market access for trade partners to their own environmental performance.
5. Oil prices rebound on U.S. inventory plunge
Oil prices rebounded sharply after a surprising and sharp drop in U.S. inventories, as reported by the American Petroleum Institute, caught the market wrong-footed.
By 6:40 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 2.2% at $39.13 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract was up 2.0% at $41.34.
The API had estimated U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 9.5 million barrels last week, confounding expectations for a rise of 2.0 million barrels. If corroborated at 10:30 AM ET by the government’s data, that could banish some of the worst fears about a faltering rebound in global fuel demand."

LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s main UK subsidiary, Amazon UK Services Ltd., paid just 6.3 million pounds ($8 million) in corporation tax in 2019 despite the group reporting over $17.5 billion in sales in Britain, accounts published on Wednesday show.
Amazon said the low figure reflected the underlying condition of its UK business. 
“Corporation tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits have remained low given retail is a highly-competitive, low margin business and we continue to invest heavily,” the company said in a statement.
Amazon does not publish its UK profits. British sales are reported largely through a web of Luxembourg-based companies, principally Amazon EU Sarl, which is also subject to UK tax on a portion of its earnings. However, that company reported a tax credit of 294 million euros last year.
Amazon has faced criticism for its tax practices in the UK for years and is currently fighting a legal battle with the European Commission over claims, which Amazon denies, that it received unfair tax advantages from Luxembourg.
Last week, the company published a report on its tax contribution to Britain which said the group incurred taxes of 293 million pounds in 2019. 
However, that figure was almost entirely made up of national insurance, a form of social security tax on employees' wages, business rates, a form of local property tax, taxes on imported goods and stamp duties on land purchases.
Other retailers say Amazon's tax efficient structure gives the Seattle-based group an unfair advantage over British rivals who face larger corporation, payroll and local tax bills.
The 2019 accounts for Amazon UK Services Ltd, which employs over 25,000 people, show the company also saved 17 million pounds in tax due to the UK’s treatment of share awards to staff, which is more generous than the treatment offered by some other countries.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's chief executive on Wednesday said the bloc should commit to deeper emissions cuts over the next decade, and pledged to use green bonds to finance its climate goals.
With wildfires, drought and collapsing glaciers wreaking havoc around the world, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said ambitious action to tackle climate change could create millions of extra jobs, aiding Europe's economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
Von der Leyen said the EU should set a target to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, against 1990 levels, confirming plans laid out in draft Commission documents previously reported by Reuters.
The EU's current 2030 emissions target is for a 40% cut. 
Von der Leyen said the upgrade would put EU ""firmly on track"" for its plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and that Commission analysis had confirmed a 55% emissions cut was economically possible.
But she acknowledged the proposal would divide the European Parliament and member states, who must approve the legally binding target but who disagree on how ambitious it should be.
""I recognise that this increase from 40 to 55 is too much for some, and not enough for others,"" she said in a speech in European Parliament.
The goal will require huge investments in transport, heavy industry and energy - where businesses will also face higher carbon costs under EU plans to revamp its carbon market.
Von der Leyen said 30% of the bloc's 750 billion euro coronavirus recovery package of grants and loans, which the EU as a whole will borrow, should be raised through green bonds.
Meanwhile, 37% of this package should be earmarked for projects to help industries decarbonise - by swapping coal for low-carbon hydrogen in industry, or installing electric car charging points.

The EU is under pressure to agree its new climate target this year, to meet a deadline for countries to make new pledges under the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. So far, no large emitters have done so.

PARIS (Reuters) - The global economy appears to be recovering from the coronavirus slump faster than thought only a few months ago thanks to improving outlooks for China and the United States, the OECD said on Wednesday.
The world economy is on course to contract 4.5% this year, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said, which - though unprecedented in recent history - was up from the 6% contraction that it forecast in June.
Provided the virus is kept from spreading out of control, the global economy will bounce back into growth next year by expanding 5%, trimmed from a June forecast of 5.2%, the Paris-based policy forum said.
However, a stronger resurgence of the virus or more strict measures to contain it could chop 2-3 percentage points from the 2021 outlook, the OECD warned.
The OECD said its forecasts were built on the assumption that local outbreaks would continue and would be targeted with local action rather than nationwide lockdowns. It also assumed a vaccine would not be widely available until late next year.
The OECD said governments and central banks' actions to support households and companies' incomes had helped avert worse downturns and should therefore be kept up as outbreaks keep appearing sporadically. 
Its brighter overall outlook for this year masked big differences between major economies with the United States, China and Europe seen performing better than feared while India, Mexico and South Africa may do worse as they struggle to contain the virus. 
Having been the first country to experience the outbreak and having moved swiftly to control its spread, China was forecast to be the only country in the G20 group of economic powers to see growth this year with an increase of 1.8%, up from a June projection of a contraction of 2.6%.
Meanwhile, the U.S. economy, the world's biggest, was also forecast to fare better this year than previously feared with a contraction of 3.8%, still dire but far better than the -7.3% forecast previously.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's fraud-hit PMC Bank has approached other banks over a possible merger even as its efforts to recover funds from a big borrower have been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, the bank's administrator said in a court filing seen by Reuters.
Authorities started investigating Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank (PMC) for fraud last year and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took control of it after detecting financial irregularities. Thousands of PMC depositors have been unable to access their deposits for a year as the RBI has capped withdrawals at 100,000 rupees ($1,359).
PMC has ""tried to engage with the major banks of the country to request for a merger"", the bank's administrator said in a Sept. 10 filing at the Delhi High Court, without identifying the banks or giving other details.
The bulk of PMC's loan book was found to be disbursed to one Indian real estate company, HDIL (NS:HDIL), and an RBI-appointed administrator, Jai Bhagwan Bhoria, has been trying to recover the dues in a bid to rescue the lender. Authorities have been investigating officials of both PMC and HDIL.
HDIL and its associates owe 69.81 billion rupees ($949 million) to PMC, but at 11.6 billion rupees ($157.56 million), the realisable value of its securities was ""grossly insufficient"", Bhoria said in the filing of the case brought forward by two aggrieved PMC depositors.
Other legal processes to sell certain securities have also been hit as courts have not been fully operational during the novel coronavirus pandemic, the filing said.
Bhoria and the RBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. HDIL, which has denied any wrongdoing, also did not respond.
Set up in 1984, PMC is a regional co-operative lender with 137 branches across six states in India, and its sudden downfall in late September 2019, has left thousands of its depositors struggling.
In his filing, Bhoria said a push to sell an HDIL yacht had also been hit as it was anchored in Sri Lanka and interested bidders had not been able to inspect it due to COVID-19 travel curbs.

Separately, two of HDIL's aircraft could not be auctioned swiftly as the Mumbai International Airport - where they have been parked - was closed to visitors, the filing said.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Some high frequency indicators are pointing towards stabilisation in economic activity in India but the recovery is still not entrenched and will only be gradual, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Wednesday.
The major economy hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, India has been forecast by most leading economists and banks to contract by around 10% in the fiscal year ending in March. 
""High frequency indicators of agricultural activity, the purchasing managers index and certain private estimates on unemployment point to some stabilisation of economic activity in the second quarter of the current year,"" Das told members of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry's national executive committee.
""The recovery is not yet fully entrenched,"" he said.
""By all indications, the recovery is likely to be gradual as efforts towards re-opening of the economy are confronted with rising infections.""
Despite India seeing one of the strictest lockdowns in the world, the country has crossed 5 million COVID-19 infections, and has the world's second highest number of cases.
Das also underlined the need to regulate non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) or shadow banks better, while highlighting the positive impact of the measures taken by the RBI to lowering borrowing costs for the government and corporates.
The RBI has all these years followed a light touch regulation policy with regards to NBFCs, Das said, adding that it has now taken measures to ensure no large entity failed as IL&FS did in 2019.
""The fragility, vulnerability of the NBFC sector is the main concern. They are still not at par with the banks in the matter of regulation and we don't want a repeat of a crisis in another NBFC,"" Das said. 
He said the government, regulators and industry will need to work jointly for revival of the economy, adding that more focus would be needed on human capital, productivity growth, exports, tourism and food processing. 
He said India's participation in the global value chains (GVCs) has been lower than many emerging and developing countries and said domestic policies need to focus on the right mix of local and foreign content in exports while aiming to increase participation in the GVCs.

""It is also important to learn from global experience and nurture those trade agreements that go beyond traditional market access issues,"" he added.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors were generally cautious before the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday, boosting the yen, as the rally that pushed up shares after Chinese and U.S. economic data in the previous session slowed in early London trading.
Risk appetite was limited ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting, and its statement at 1800 GMT.
European shares were mixed at the opening, but then rose, with the Stoxx 600 up around 0.3%, pushed up by gains in retail stocks.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up 0.2% at 0724 GMT, while MSCI's main European Index was up 0.3%. 
(Graphic: World stocks, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnvwjelxpw/Pasted%20image%201600243112184.png) 
The Fed is not expected to make changes to its monetary policy at the meeting, which will be its first since it announced that it would pursue average inflation targeting. 
Although the economic projections are expected to be somewhat improved from the last round of forecasts in June, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to stick to his message that the road to recovery will be long and uncertain.
""While acknowledging the more rapid improvement in the economic backdrop, we expect the message to remain one of caution,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analysts in a note to clients.
""There is no upside for the committee to be positive at this juncture.""
Investors will also be watching for U.S. retail sales data, due at 1230 GMT, which is expected to show a robust increase.
London's FTSE 100 lagged other European indexes, down 0.4%, and the pound was down against the euro, weighed down by fears of a disorderly departure from the EU single market.
UK inflation dropped to its lowest rate in almost five years last month, led by a large reduction in meal prices.
""We’ve already started to see the early signs of the unemployment rate starting to edge higher, and with the furlough coming to an end next month and already being tapered, this deflationary wave is likely to get worse in the short term,"" wrote Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. 
The yen hit a two-week high of 105.250 to the U.S. dollar overnight, as investors sought safer assets, and it held close to these levels at 105.325 at 0726 GMT.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was a touch weaker, down 0.1% at 93.005 at 0740 GMT.
The euro was up 0.1% at $1.18595.
High-rated eurozone government debt was little changed, with the benchmark German 10-year Bund yield at -0.483%.
Oil prices rose for a second day in a row, with U.S. crude oil hitting one week highs, up 2.4% at $39.21 a barrel at 0746 GMT.

Gold prices rose, up 0.5% at $1964.38 an ounce at 0747 GMT.
Elsewhere, the World Trade Organization ruled that the United States had breached global trade rules with the multibillion-dollar tariffs it imposed during its trade war with China.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Parliament on Tuesday voted to allow some gas projects to get support from the European Union's flagship green transition fund, teeing up tough talks with the EU Commission and national goverments, which have already agreed to exclude the fuel.
The EU wants to launch a multi-billion-euro Just Transition Fund, using cash from the bloc's coronavirus recovery fund and budget, to help fossil fuel dependent regions shift to cleaner industries. 
The money aims to push countries towards EU goals to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and a new, tougher 2030 emissions-cutting target, which the EU Commission will propose this week.
But rules to decide who gets the money need to be finalised by the European Parliament, Commission and national goverments.
The parliament will formally approve its position with another vote on Wednesday folowing the vote to support an amendment to allow some gas projects to receive the money. 
Its stance is at odds with that of the Commission and national governments, who must approval the final rules for the Fund, and have already said it should be off limits to all fossil fuels.
Gas emits roughly 50% less CO2 than coal when burned in power plants, but it is also associated with leaks of methane, a potent planet-warming greenhouse gas.

The divisions highlight the tough task facing the EU - which, having pledged ambitious climate action, must agree how to make that happen across its 27 member states.

In recent years, the party has sought to tighten its grip on private businesses, by taking stakes in non-state enterprises or installing officials in large firms, even as President Xi Jinping repeatedly pledged to back the sector key to growth and jobs. 
Citing rising risks and diversified values and interests among entrepreneurs, the party issued guidelines late on Tuesday advising private firms how to position themselves politically.
Business people must ""maintain high consistency"" with the party regarding the political aspects of position, direction and principles, say the guidelines published by the Xinhua official news agency.
""We should build a backbone team of people in the private economy that can be relied on and used at critical moments,"" it said.
The party also encouraged private firms to participate in reforms of state firms and the ""Belt and Road"" initiative, while pledging to improve the business environment for them. 
China's once-vibrant private firms are struggling to fend off the impact of the virus, despite government pledges to boost credit and tax support and open up more state-dominated sectors, analysts said.
The deepening rift with United States and the pandemic have amplified worries among private businesses over their political status, said Xin Sun, a lecturer in Chinese and East Asian business at King's College London.
""As a result, many private business owners become less confident in China's economic prospects, and presumably, also, the future of Communist rule,"" Sun said. 
""At the same time, the party does still need contribution from the private sector, especially during such difficult times, in various important economic and political areas.""

Germany's top court ruled earlier this year that lawmakers failed to exercise appropriate control over the Bundesbank, which must quit the European Central Bank's government bond purchase programme unless it could justify its participation.
The early May ruling threatened to force the euro zone's biggest central bank to withdraw from a stimulus scheme that is credited with holding up growth before the coronavirus and averting a financial crisis amid the pandemic.
Since that ruling, the ECB has sent a justification of its 2.3 trillion euro Public Sector Purchase Programme to the German government and parliament, which was accepted by Berlin. 
The Bundesbank has also agreed to participate in quarterly hearings billed as ""monetary dialogue,"" modelled after similar meetings held for the ECB President by the European Parliament.
The hearing also comes as the ECB faces a fresh legal challenge after lawmakers for the AfD party last month filed a complaint against the ECB's Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP), claiming that the scheme exceeds the ECB's mandate.

The 1.35 trillion PEPP was launched earlier this year at the height of the coronavirus crisis to keep borrowing costs down and prevent the pandemic from morphing into a sovereign debt crisis.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's new leader Yoshihide Suga will struggle to push through structural reforms as they would be too painful for an economy hit by the coronavirus crisis, said an executive of PIMCO, one of the world's largest investment firms.
Tomoya Masanao, head of the Pacific Investment Management Co's (PIMCO) Japan arm, also said the Bank of Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy will allow the government to continue ramping up spending, but not without huge costs.
Since adopting in 2016 a policy capping borrowing costs, the BOJ's policy is essentially financing public debt and is integrated into the government's debt-management strategy, Masanao said.
""It's impossible for the BOJ to make an independent decision on exiting ultra-easy policy. Any move toward an exit would need to take into account the impact on long-term interest rates and fiscal policy,"" he told Reuters on Wednesday.
California-based PIMCO, a unit of German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG), managed 12.84 trillion yen ($121.90 billion) in assets for Japanese clients as of June 2020.
Suga, who was elected as new prime minister on Wednesday, has vowed to break barriers that hamper competition and pursue reforms to revitalise the world's third-largest economy.
If successful, Suga would provide the missing third arrow of his predecessor Shinzo Abe's ""Abenomics"" policies that consisted of bold fiscal, monetary easing and structural reforms.
But Masanao said he was doubtful Suga can push through painful reforms, when there is little fiscal and monetary ammunition left to support an economy hit by COVID-19.
""Abenomics succeeded in boosting growth and jobs, which was why Abe stayed in power for so long. But he didn't use the political capital to push through reforms,"" Masanao said.
""Suga also has a structural reform agenda. But the point is you need to first reflate the economy to undertake real reforms, which are by nature deflationary at least in the short run.""
Japan deployed two huge spending packages, accompanied by monetary easing steps by the BOJ, to cushion the blow from the pandemic that pushed the economy into deep recession.
By successfully capping borrowing costs at zero, the BOJ will likely allow the government to keep spending massively without causing an unwelcome spike in inflation, Masanao said.
But maintaining huge fiscal and monetary support for too long could distort market pricing and hurt Japan's productivity by hampering reallocation of resources to growth areas, he said.
""The unintended consequences of prolonged ultra-loose policy are huge, most notably by distorting asset prices,"" Masanao said. ""It's eliminating the chance of proper market pricing.""
With interest rates sliding across the world, Pimco is neutral on Japanese government bonds (JGBs) in its global portfolio, he said.
Pimco is also ""somewhat under-weight"" on super-long JGBs as the BOJ is seen allowing the longer end of the curve to move more flexibly and help steepen the yield curve, Masanao said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Executives from 30 of Europe's leading companies backed the EU's Green Deal on Wednesday and pledged to overhaul their businesses to help the bloc achieve climate-neutrality by 2050.
The commitment, from companies including  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Axa, Snam and Royal DSM, came ahead of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's State of the Union address in Brussels.
The European Green Deal forms a key plank of von der Leyen's plan for the EU to both recover from the economic ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic and meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which aims to limit global warming.
The company leaders are all part of a CEO Action Group for the European Green Deal, launched last year in cooperation with the World Economic Forum and the Commission with the aim of mobilising business to contribute to the political effort.
In a statement, the group laid out its initial plan for businesses to help ensure the COVID-19 recovery plan reset the bloc's economic growth model with a focus on the circular economy, which embraces recyling and reusing, as well as renewable energy and low-carbon industries.
""We have to take more and faster action with more emphasis on sustainability and circularity. The European Green Deal presents an opportunity to do just this. It requires a strong partnership between business, politics and society,"" said the co-chairs of the group, Axa CEO Thomas Buberl and Feike Sybesma, honorary chairman of Royal DSM.
The leaders laid out a number of steps, including ""embracing new production and work models"" and backed ""clear, time-bound and measurable targets"" for any companies receiving COVID-19 bailout money.
A key part of that would entail making sure each company's business model was in line with the plan, providing training and education to help people prosper in the new economy and disclosing meaningful data to help chart their progress.

The next step for the group, whose members employ around three million people and account for around 850 billion euros in revenues, will be to agree concrete actions by topic that the companies will commit to and report on.

459,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 01:15AM ET</span>","Fed expected to raise economic forecasts, extend vow to keep rates low","By Ann Saphir and Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is expected to wrap up its latest policy meeting on Wednesday with somewhat rosier economic forecasts but a renewed pledge to keep interest rates low for as long as the world's biggest economy needs to recover from its deepest downturn in decades.
The two-day meeting is the U.S. central bank's first under a newly adopted framework that promises to shoot for inflation above 2% to make up for periods, such as now, where it is running below that target. The strategy means the Fed will not take its foot off the monetary gas pedal even if unemployment continues to drop at a faster-than-expected pace. 
Fed officials don't appear ready to translate that framework into an explicit promise to keep the central bank's key overnight lending rate in its current range of 0% to 0.25% until certain economic benchmarks - say, 2.5% inflation - are met.
The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to release its policy statement and a summary of fresh economic projections at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to hold a virtual news briefing half an hour later. 
""We expect the Committee to adopt this type of outcome-based forward guidance by the end of the year,"" Lewis Alexander, chief U.S. economist at Nomura, wrote in a note ahead of this week's Fed meeting. 
But the Fed is likely to close out this meeting with other signals for its long-term commitment to easy monetary policy, Alexander and other analysts said. 
Those may include incorporating into the post-meeting policy statement the new ""average"" 2% inflation target and fresh quarterly forecasts showing most if not all Fed policymakers see no need to raise interest rates through at least 2023. 
The Fed may also lean into its bond-buying program as a means to support the U.S. recovery from the recession triggered by the coronavirus epidemic rather than to just supply liquidity to fragile financial markets. Such a change would shore up expectations for a continued easy money policy without actually bolstering purchases. 
DOVISH SURPRISE?
Still, there's room for surprises on Wednesday, including the chance the Fed will provide more formal forward guidance on interest rates, or a ramp-up in bond-buying that would signal a more muscular approach to economic stimulus. 
""In both these cases, and especially the latter, the market reaction could be quite dovish,"" Cornerstone Macro economist Roberto Perli wrote on Monday.
Since Fed policymakers last met in late July, the economic outlook has brightened somewhat. A scary midsummer spike in daily new U.S. cases of COVID-19 has subsided, though clusters of infections continue to surface around the country. More than 194,000 Americans have died from the disease, according to a Reuters tally.
The economy also has recouped about half of the 22 million jobs lost in the first two months of the recession, unemployment has dropped to 8.4% from a crisis high of 14.7%, manufacturing activity has increased and some measures of consumer spending have surged.
But much of the recent data suggests the recovery is slowing. 
So while the summary of Fed policymaker projections is expected to point to lower unemployment and faster economic growth than anticipated in the last round of forecasts in June, Powell will likely stick to his message that the road to recovery will be long and bumpy. 
That may be doubly so because much of the government aid to small businesses and the unemployed contained in a $2.3 trillion spending package passed by the U.S. Congress in March is gone, and lawmakers are at an impasse over providing another aid package. A stopgap program to give the unemployed an extra $300 every week - less than the now-expired $600 weekly supplemental payment under the first rescue package - ended this month.

Powell and other Fed officials have repeatedly said the economic damage of the coronavirus crisis will be harder to undo without new government aid.

Dahua, China's second-largest surveillance equipment maker, is among Chinese tech firms that Washington last year placed on a blacklist of companies it said helped Beijing monitor and detain Uighurs and other Muslim minorities. Those blacklisted cannot buy U.S. technology without U.S. government approval.
E-commerce leader Alibaba and top telecommunications group China Mobile plan to jointly invest in Shenzhen-listed Dahua - which has a market capitalisation of $10.3 billion - via a private share placement in coming weeks, the people said.
China Mobile is also negotiating a three-year business agreement with Dahua worth 40 billion yuan, said two of the people, who declined to be identified as the plans are private.
The agreement would give China Mobile use of Dahua's big data and cloud computing services, video surveillance equipment and Internet of Things (IoT) technology, they said.
The business agreement and investment plan are reported here for the first time. Neither China Mobile nor Alibaba responded to requests for comment. Dahua said it did not have any information on the matter.
SMART CITY DEMAND
The deals would come as the government builds over 500 smart cities featuring the world's most sophisticated surveillance technology networks, with millions of cameras in public places and increased use of techniques such as facial recognition to manage issues as varied as traffic and public health.
The initiative could be a boon for Hangzhou-based Dahua and rival Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd, with products such as video surveillance, access control and remote image monitoring systems.
China's smart city market is likely to be worth 25 trillion yuan by 2022 from 7.9 trillion yuan in 2018, showed July data from researcher Qianzhan. The COVID-19 pandemic has added to prospects with demand surging globally for thermal cameras.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) bought 1,500 cameras from Dahua - which is present in over 50 countries - in a near $10 million deal to take workers' temperatures, Reuters reported in April.

Dahua chairman Fu Liquan is the surveillance firm's single largest shareholder with a 34% stake, with minority shareholders including state-owned Central Huijin Asset Management, showed the company's 2020 first-half earnings report.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, pressing for new social media regulations, plans to nominate a senior administration official to be a member of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the White House said on Tuesday.
The nomination of Nathan Simington, a senior adviser at the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), comes after the White House abruptly announced in early August it was withdrawing the nomination of Republican FCC Commissioner Mike O'Rielly to serve another term.
Trump issued an executive order in May requiring the NTIA to petition the FCC asking the commission to impose new regulations on social media moderation practices after  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) warned readers to fact-check his posts about unsubstantiated allegations of fraud in mail-in voting.
Simington helped draft the May executive order, the Washington Post reported.
By contrast, O'Rielly expressed skepticism about whether the FCC had authority to issue new regulations covering social media companies. In July, he said the ""the First Amendment protects us from limits on speech imposed by the government - not private actors - and we should all reject demands, in the name of the First Amendment, for private actors to curate or publish speech in a certain way.""
O'Rielly, who has not commented on the White House withdrawal of his name, congratulated Simington Tuesday in a Twitter post on his nomination ""and offer best wishes for a smooth confirmation process and successful term.""
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai opened NTIA's petition to public comment. The comment period expires this week. He has declined to comment on its merits.
A group representing major internet companies including  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) urged the FCC to reject the petition, saying the effort ""is misguided, lacks grounding in law, and poses serious public policy concerns.""

NTIA asked the FCC to limit protections for social media companies under Section 230, a provision of the 1996 Communications Decency Act that shields social media companies from liability for content posted by their users and allows them to remove lawful but objectionable posts.

That’s less than the 4.6% contraction projected in the May budget. The jobless rate will rise to 7.8% by 2022, lower than the 9.8% peak anticipated four months ago, Treasury said.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, seeking a second term in the Oct. 17 election, says her strategy to eliminate Covid-19 with a strict nationwide lockdown has been vindicated by a rapid economic rebound. Still, the government today projected larger budget deficits in the near term and higher net debt than forecast in the budget.“There are signs that the New Zealand economy is robust, and that our plan to eliminate Covid-19 and open up the economy faster is the right approach,” Finance Minister Grant Robertson said. “However, global headwinds and this 1-in-100 year economic shock will have a long-term effect on the government’s books.”The economy benefited from spending just seven weeks in lockdown, while a government wage subsidy cushioned the impact on household incomes, Treasury said.Official data tomorrow will confirm the economy contracted for a second straight quarter in the three months through June, the nation’s first recession since 2010, though Treasury and bank economists have significantly scaled back the expected severity of the slump. Still, in the medium term GDP growth is projected to be slower than the budget showed. Growth will average 2.8% over the period to June 2024, down from 3.9% in the budget.The long-term recovery is slower than previously expected because of the more persistent impacts of coronavirus and predictions of a weak global economy impacting on trade and tourism. New Zealand’s border is assumed to stay closed throughout 2021, although there may be scope for some relaxation from the third quarter as a result of safe travel zones, the Treasury said.Robertson said he wants to open the border earlier than Treasury has assumed if it can be done safely.While the pandemic’s impact on the labor market won’t be as severe, it will persist. Instead of peaking in 2020 and then recovering, the jobless rate will build over a longer period and stay higher for longer.A weaker world outlook and slower pace of domestic recovery means nominal GDP will be about NZ$13 billion less than projected over the four years to June 2024. That will curb tax revenue and build pressure on the budget position. At the same time, government spending balloons as it provides fiscal support to the economy, with expenses reaching 39.4% of GDP in 2021.The budget deficit is projected to widen to NZ$31.7 billion in the year ending June 2021 from NZ$23.3 billion a year earlier. Deficits are likely to narrow but won’t disappear until at least 2034.Net debt is expected to surge to NZ$130.2 billion or 43% of GDP at June 30, 2021. By June 2024 debt will blow out to NZ$201 billion or 55.3% of GDP –- a slightly higher ratio than projected in the budget because the economy won’t be as big.Still, low interest rates mean finance costs are forecast to reduce, while an improved government cash position will allow the Treasury to reduce its debt program. New Zealand Debt Management cut its 2020-21 bond sales program by NZ$10 billion to NZ$50 billion.

New enrollments of international students from India expanded 32% in 2019 from a year earlier and it’s the fastest growing major market for Australian services. India has overtaken China as the largest source of net migration to Australia, and its diaspora is the third largest Down Under, just behind China and the U.K.
India’s swelling population -- set to overtake China’s in 2027 -- suggests ongoing opportunities for Australia to diversify a trade portfolio that currently makes it the developed world’s most China-dependent economy. The need to switch things up has accelerated as ties sank to their lowest ebb in 30 years after Canberra’s calls for an international inquiry into Covid-19’s origins was taken by Beijing as a political attack, with China imposing barriers on barley, beef and wine from Down Under.
This has Australia looking to its democratic, cricket-loving ally to fill the void. Prime Minister Scott Morrison held a virtual summit with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi in June and the two signed a defense agreement and upgraded ties to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The trade ministers of Japan, India and Australia recently agreed to work toward achieving supply chain resilience in the Indo-Pacific region.
“We can sell India education, health care, and there’s potential in science and technology,” said Ian Hall, a professor of international relations at Griffith University in Queensland. “It’s much more the consumer market of India’s growing middle class than goods.”
Yet trade with India has its own challenges. Its government is wedded to economic nationalism, as showcased last year when it pulled out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership designed to free up trade.
Delhi wants to send lots of people to Australia on work visas and doesn’t want to reduce tariffs, according to former Australian Trade Minister Craig Emerson (NYSE:EMR), who initiated the Australia-India free trade negotiations in 2011, resulting in a two-way trade around just one tenth of China-Australia shipments.
“India is highly concerned about its trade deficit,” said Lai-Ha Chan, a political scientist at the University of Technology in Sydney, who notes that after signing free trade agreements with South Korea and Japan, India’s trade deficit with those nations ballooned. “It would be very worried about Australian farm products, like dairy, harming Indian farmers.”
Australia’s most valuable export -- iron ore -- hasn’t been caught in China’s cross hairs yet, perhaps due to a lack of alternative suppliers. Yet Beijing appears to be giving itself greater flexibility, with Emerson noting that China is buying ore carriers that improve the economics of long-distance shipping from Brazil and purchasing Guinea mines.
“It’s entirely possible China, once it gets all three mineral provinces in a row -- Guinea, Brazil and Australia -- will play one off against the other to get a better price,” he said. “If you’re China, you’d say ‘where’s our vulnerability? Iron ore. So let’s diversify, let’s fix that.’ They may never need to activate it, but it’s there, it’s available.”
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
Australia’s services exports have been experiencing a quiet tectonic shift over the past 18 months. In education, growth in Indian enrollments has seen the number of Indian student visa holders eclipse Chinese students. While China’s dominance of Australia’s goods exports reflects commodities demand, in the employment-intensive services sector China’s importance has been challenged by a doubling of services exports to India over the past two years.

GENEVA/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization found on Tuesday that the United States breached global trading rules by imposing multibillion-dollar tariffs in President Donald Trump's trade war with China, a ruling that drew anger from Washington.
The Trump administration says its tariffs imposed two years ago on more than $200 billion in Chinese goods were justified because China was stealing intellectual property and forcing U.S. companies to transfer technology for access to China's markets. 
But the WTO's three-member panel said the U.S. duties broke trading rules because they applied only to China and were above maximum rates agreed to by the United States. Washington had not then adequately explained why its measures were a justified exception, the panel concluded.
""This panel report confirms what the Trump administration has been saying for four years: the WTO is completely inadequate to stop China's harmful technology practices,"" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in response.
China's Commerce Ministry said Beijing supported the multilateral trading system and respected WTO rules and rulings, and hoped Washington would do the same.
The decision will have little immediate effect on the U.S. tariffs and is just the start of a legal process that could take years to play out, ultimately leading to the WTO approving retaliatory measures if it is upheld - moves that China has already taken on its own. 
The United States is likely to appeal Tuesday's ruling. That would put the case into a legal void, however, because Washington has already blocked the appointment of judges to the WTO's appellate body, preventing it from convening the minimum number required to hear cases.
The WTO panel was aware it was stepping into hot water. It noted that it had looked only into the U.S. measures and not China's retaliation, which Washington has not challenged at the WTO.
""The panel is very much aware of the wider context in which the WTO system currently operates, which is one reflecting a range of unprecedented global trade tensions,"" the 66-page report concluded.
'TAKE STOCK'
The panel recommended the United States bring its measures ""into conformity with its obligations"", but also encouraged the two sides to work to resolve the overall dispute.
""Time is available for the parties to take stock as proceedings evolve and further consider opportunities for mutually agreed and satisfactory solutions,"" it said.
During a two-year trade war with Beijing, Trump threatened tariffs on nearly all Chinese imports - more than $500 billion - before the two countries signed a ""Phase 1"" trade deal in January. Extra tariffs are still in place on some $370 billion worth of Chinese goods, and $62.16 billion in duties have been collected since July 2018, U.S. Customs data https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/trade show.
Trump has described the WTO as ""horrible"" and biased towards China, often threatening to quit.
As he left the White House for a campaign rally, Trump said he would ""have to do something about the WTO because they've let China get away with murder.""
He said he needed to take a closer look at the ruling, but added: ""I'm not a big fan of the WTO - that I can tell you right now. Maybe they did us a big favor.""
The decision could help fuel a Trump decision to leave the WTO or underpin U.S. arguments for reforming the 25-year-old trade body, said Margaret Cekuta, a former USTR official who helped write a crucial report on China's intellectual property abuses that preceded Trump's tariffs.
""It gives the administration ammo to say the WTO is out of date. If they can’t rule on intellectual property rights, then what is their position in the broader economy going forward?"" said Cekuta, now a principal with the Capitol Counsel lobbying firm.

Trump, critical of multilateral institutions, has already quit the U.N. cultural organisation UNESCO and plans to leave the World Health Organization.

466,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 05:09PM ET</span>",Suga Sets Sights on Structural Reforms for Debt-Ridden Japan,"(Bloomberg) -- Yoshihide Suga, the man set to become Japan’s new prime minister later today, has a reputation as a tough, task-based micro manager rather than a self-styled macroeconomic helmsman like Shinzo Abe.
Suga has vowed to stay true to Abenomics, but economists doubt there’s much more monetary pizazz to be squeezed out of the Bank of Japan or any more major spending splurges left in a public purse that’s already more reliant on debt than any other developed economy.
That leaves the third pillar of Abenomics, structural reform, as Suga’s best line of attack for reshaping economic policy. Suga sees himself as a reformer who wants to bring Japan’s bureaucracy into the digital age and tackle thorny issues such as regulatory reform and administrative inefficiency.
“I’m optimistic because under Abenomics -- and, of course, Suga was one of the major architects of it -- they did just about everything they could do on macro policy,” said Robert Feldman, senior adviser at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) MUFG. “Where Abenomics has been a little less aggressive has been on some of the structural reforms, this is an area where Suga is very eager to push forward.”
Read More: JAPAN REACT: Suga’s Strong Win Suggests Steady Policy Course
Suga has already called for more competition among mobile phone carriers to bring down fees and hinted at the need to weed out weaker regional banks. It remains to be seen whether he will continue to pinpoint industries at a micro level or broaden out to more wholesale change.
“I want to make solid progress on regulatory reform,” Suga said after becoming leader of the ruling party on Monday. “I want to take a proper look at things that are wrong, and move Japan forward by breaking down ministerial divides, vested interests, and a culture of just doing what’s been done before.”
Suga has a track record of keeping bureaucrats in line and consolidating their responsibilities, and even wrote a book about it. That suggests he may act quickly on administrative reform and setting up a digitalization agency.
He also worked in the deregulation-focused administration of Junichiro Koizumi that pushed the growth of jobs outside the cosy safeguards of Japan’s life-time employment.
A further breaking down of the wall dividing regular workers and contracted workers on pay and job security would likely impress economists, especially if it improves productivity. But Suga has remained quiet on the topic of labor market reform, casting some doubt on how radically he will try to shake things up.
Read More: New Japan Leader Seeks to End ‘Curse’ of Revolving-Door Premiers
He also has a hard act to follow. With big picture imagery, Abe generated optimistic expectations of change both at home and abroad when he swept to power promising to restore Japan’s economic power and prestige and wipe out deflation. Abe built confidence in Japan’s renewed direction again after years of short-lived premiers.
With an election due in little more than a year at the latest, the more domestic-orientated Suga will need to show he can hold on to voter and market trust to ensure he sticks around long enough to gain traction on reform. First, he’ll need to haul the economy out of a historic hole, after the battering of Covid-19, while keeping new infections under control.
He may even prefer to get an election out of the way early, before any risk of getting entangled in difficulties, to give his administration a clearer mandate and secure a longer-term premiership.
So far financial markets have found comfort in Suga as the continuity replacement. The Nikkei 225 has reversed losses since Abe’s shock resignation announcement on Aug. 28. The yen remains slightly softer against the dollar.
Suga has touted both a weaker yen and higher stocks as achievements of Abenomics, suggesting he will keep on the same path as long as these market yardsticks don’t change dramatically. But beyond that and a splash of reform talk, the new prime minister has kept his policy explanations to a minimum. He’s also yet to identify key economic advisers like Abe had in the reflationists Koichi Hamada and Etsuro Honda.
“We’re calling it Suganomics because Suga says he’ll maintain Abe’s economic policy, but it’s unclear to me whether Suga will really incorporate any particular policy mix as part of his strategy,” said Hideo Kumano, chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute. “Maybe there’s not much economics in Suganomics at all. Talking about specific themes isn’t really a policy package.”
When Suga suggested a sales tax hike was inevitable last week, he quickly walked back those vote-losing remarks to align himself with Abe’s stance, an indication he doesn’t want to stray too far from the status quo. Economic growth must come before balancing the nation’s books, Suga has indicated. The burden of public debt to GDP is set to increase to 268% this year, according to Bloomberg Economics.
Markets will eventually price in any differences from Abe that emerge, according to Hiroshi Matsumoto, head of Japan investment at Pictet Asset Management.
“It’s a bit much to say Suga’s policy is too micro-oriented, but it does lack easy-to-understand talking points that will appeal to foreign investors,” Matsumoto said.

468,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 03:55PM ET</span>",Perpetual recession? Recovery in a year? Economists deeply divided on U.S. future,"By Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A year from now the United States may have emerged from the economic hole dug during the pandemic with growth smartly above its previous trend and output largely recovered.
Or it may be struggling to patch a remaining $2 trillion gash to gross domestic product, with growth stuck in low gear, an ongoing health crisis, and chronic joblessness.
The guessing game that U.S. economic forecasting has become has produced a massive split in predictions as economists from the Federal Reserve to the top Wall Street firms take a stab at unknowables like the path of the pandemic and the ability of a fractured Congress to compromise on spending. 
It has given policymakers little solid to plan around and left the Fed reluctant to announce new steps to support the economy until it's clearer what's needed and for how long.
When Fed officials meet this week, they are not expected to take policy steps in part because of ""a very uncertain outlook,"" Cornerstone Macro analysts wrote this week. ""Calibrating ... in these conditions is very challenging.""
Adding to the challenge: Any rebound in GDP - the broadest gauge of economic activity - may well not be matched in the job market, leaving millions of unemployed Americans with no sense of recovery at all even if growth outperforms.
Indeed, since the 1990s jobs have rebounded far more slowly from recessions than GDP as firms retool to use fewer workers and wait for demand to fully recover before hiring. Between the millions now out of work in vulnerable industries like travel and hospitality and changes in how commerce will be organized after the virus, it could take even longer this time for sidelined workers to find a new foothold.
The economy is currently about 11 million jobs below February's level. It took more than four years, until mid-2014, to recover the 8 million jobs lost in the 2007-2009 recession. 
This recovery is clearly different. The economy's addition of more than 10 million jobs over the past four months surprised many policymakers. The 8.4% unemployment rate as of August is already below the 9.3% median year-end expectation among Fed officials. 
Central bankers this week must now judge whether or not that pace of improvement will continue, a discussion framed by new economic forecasts they will release on Wednesday afternoon.
When their last projections were issued in June there was a veritable chasm dividing them. Individual forecasts for 2020 saw GDP falling as much as 10% or as little as 4.2%. The gap was 10 times as wide as in December 2019, when year-end predictions between the most optimistic and most pessimistic officials were separated by only half a percentage point. 
Year-end estimates of the unemployment rate as of June ranged from 7% to 14%, also several times wider than those common during the last recession and its immediate aftermath.
For a graphic on COVID's yawning gap in forecasts COVID's yawning gap in forecasts:
https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/RECOVERY/bdwpkkgqopm/chart.png
RECORD GROWTH, THEN WHAT?
Economists do agree that when the federal government next month releases its first estimate of GDP for the July through September period, it will likely break records for growth just as the April to June period saw a record decline.
But from there they diverge not based on their models or their math, but on how they read the political winds and their best guess on the success of a coronavirus vaccine.
Assume Congress approves another $1 trillion stimulus, businesses rebuild inventories, and a vaccine comes on line early next year, and you get Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' league-leading call of 35% annualized growth from July to September, steady growth from there, and a quick climb to pre-pandemic levels of output. 
Assume no stimulus, slow deployment of a vaccine, and lethargic spending because families and local governments are broke, and ""the economy will never regain the pre-COVID trend line,"" Deloitte LP senior manager Daniel Bachman wrote, among the few analysts predicting the current downturn to produce a permanent economic hit. 
Many forecasters have boosted their outlook for the current quarter over time, as data has surprised to the upside. The Atlanta Fed's running tally, or 'nowcast,' of economic growth has nearly tripled since July to a 30.8% annualized rate, nearly matching the 31.7% drop in the second quarter.
The critical issue now is whether the run of good news continues.
""We should allow for the window of possibilities here to be broader than what we were thinking,"" during the bleak early days of the pandemic, including that a ""virtuous circle"" of self-reinforcing outcomes could still develop, said Erik Weisman, chief economist of MFS Investment Management. 

But for that ""you'd have to see a flu season that is not so bad. No second wave (of the coronavirus). No blow up with China. Constructive news on a vaccine. And an election result that does not amount to a constitutional crisis,"" he said. ""Some of these will go the wrong way.""

The top 5% of households -- those making $451,122 on average last year -- have seen their inflation-adjusted incomes jump 28% since 2009, according to annual figures published by the Census Bureau on Tuesday.
The gain -- which helped push inequality to the widest in decades -- compares with a mere 11% rise for the bottom 20%, whose income rose to about $15,290 from roughly $13,800 a decade ago. Those in the middle groups -- who made between $40,600 and $111,100 last year -- saw their incomes rise between 16% to 18%, the data show.
The report underscores just how endemic poverty is in America, even in times of economic expansion. While incomes have increased, so has the cost of living, with consumer prices rising 20% since 2009.

In 2019 the bottom 20% saw income grow 9% from the previous year, the fastest annual gain among all the groups. But their average income was still less than half of households in the next group.
Census officials attributed the broader gain in household income, among the best ever recorded, to increased employment and wages -- for example, unemployed people in households who got jobs. The data also showed that the highest-paid Americans reaped the majority of the income gains.

(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan told investors on Tuesday that the worst pandemic-related revenue declines could soon be in the rear-view mirror.
Speaking at the  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Global Financial Services Conference, Moynihan said third quarter net interest income, a closely watched measure of how much money the bank makes from lending, is expected to fall by up to $700 million due to a drop-off in loan demand. However, he predicted revenue will stabilize going into the end of the year.
""It looks like 3Q will be the bottom,"" he said. ""It'll take another several quarters before it really starts growing again ... But right now, it looks like this quarter could be the trough based on everything I see.""
Bank profitability took at hit in the first half of the year as the four largest U.S. lenders set aside nearly $60 billion to brace for potential loan losses as the coronavirus pandemic halted economic activity across the country. The Federal Reserve also slashed interest rates nearly to zero in response to the crisis, further limiting how much banks could make from lending.
Bank of America, the second largest U.S. bank by assets, does not expect to need to book another significant expense for loan loss reserves in the third quarter based on current trends.
“We set our second quarter reserves with a set of scenarios that had turned out that the actual data has been better,” Moynihan said.

Fee-based income continues to be a bright spot for the bank, though at more modest levels. Trading revenue is expected to be up 5% from last year compared with a 35% surge in the second quarter. Investment banking fees, which saw a record 57% jump last quarter, are expected to grow between 3% and 5%.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) will avoid involuntary furloughs for frontline employees on Oct. 1 except for pilots, but will continue to reduce work hours and executive pay through the end of the year, Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in a memo to employees on Tuesday.
Delta's major rivals American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) have warned that more than 40,000 frontline jobs are at risk without an extension of federal aid that has kept employees on payroll through this month as airlines suffer a deep downturn due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Atlanta-based Delta can avoid furloughs because of strong demand for voluntary programs that have lightened its staffing and a 25% reduction in work-hours, which it is extending through the end of the year, Bastian said in the memo, which was reviewed by Reuters.
In addition, Bastian will forego his salary and continue to reduce officers' salaries by 50% this year.
Bastian said Delta has ""effectively managed"" its staffing between now and the start of peak summer 2021 travel but continues to support an extension of government aid to help protect airline industry jobs, including those of its pilots.
""While we are all grateful for our ability to mitigate furloughs, it’s important to remember that we are still in a grim economic situation,"" he said.

Output at factories increased 1% from the prior month after an upwardly revised 3.9% gain in July, Federal Reserve data showed Tuesday. The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for a 1.3% rise. Manufacturing capacity utilization increased to 70.2%.
Total industrial production, which also includes mining and utility output, rose 0.4% in August after an upwardly revised 3.5% advance a month earlier. Mining was restrained by a temporary decline in oil and gas extraction related to tropical storms along the Gulf Coast.
While industrial output in the previous two months posted the sharpest gains since 1959, the burst of production is tapering off as the Fed’s index remains well below pre-lockdown levels. Nonetheless, manufacturing will continue to benefit from lean inventories, steady domestic sales and a pickup in overseas demand.
The Fed’s report showed that total capacity utilization, including factories, mines and utilities, edged up to 71.4% from July’s 71.1%. Still, the plant-use rate is well below the 76.9% seen in February. Unused capacity weighs on corporate profits because capital is underutilized. It also signals that business investment in new equipment will remain depressed, which could weigh on economic growth. Further, employment in the manufacturing sector remains far below pre-pandemic levels.
Production of motor vehicles and parts dropped 3.7% after sharp advances in the prior three months, while factory output excluding auto production increased 1.4% after a 1.9% increase. Utility output dropped 0.4% in August.
Mining output dropped 2.5% as oil and gas well drilling decreased 1.2% after an 8% decline a month earlier. Drilling has plummeted 71% from a year earlier after weaker oil prices prompted exploration and production companies to slash projects.
In a separate report Tuesday, manufacturing in New York state expanded in September at the second-fastest pace since 2018, indicating more momentum for the industry.

The collaboration will equip BMW vehicles with the ability to analyse the road surface attributes under their tires, enabling detection of road conditions.
Tactile Mobility develops software that uses a vehicle’s non-visual sensors, including wheel speed, wheel angle, RPM and gear position to help smart and autonomous vehicles “feel” vehicle-road dynamics and road conditions.
In October Tactile Mobility said it secured $9 million in funding from a group of investors that included  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p).

The cooperation between BMW and Tactile Mobility began through the BMW Startup Garage, the venture client unit of the BMW Group.

LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) have teamed up with artificial intelligence (AI) technology startup Saphyre to automate the opening of custody accounts, the companies said on Tuesday.
The system, which uses AI to remember when an asset manager has already uploaded a specific document needed to open a custody account, has been tested for the past six months and will now be used by the bank with BlackRock and other asset managers. 
The companies believe the system will make new funds get to market quicker by streamlining what is now a heavily manual process involving reams of paperwork, spreadsheets and faxes.
""The custody side, historically, has been a very traditional industry operating steadily and reliably with faxes and spreadsheets,"" said Naveen TV, managing director, product development in securities services at JPMorgan. 
""Asset managers are starting to realize that the lack of automation is causing issues, and is actually a missed opportunity to be more efficient.""
The partnership comes as large financial institutions increasingly turn to tech-savvy startups to help them automate and digitize some of their burdensome processes.
JPMorgan, which has $27.4 trillion of assets under custody, took on over $1 trillion of BlackRock's assets in 2017. The bank has securities services operations in 30 countries and a custodial network in more than 95 markets. 
""We are digitizing this whole pre-trade space,"" said Gabino Roche, Saphyre's chief executive. ""This becomes more important in the post COVID-19 world."" 
In many cases, COVID-19 lockdowns have further slowed down the process of setting up custody accounts, as a lot of the documents required need to be printed and signed by multiple parties, said JPMorgan's TV. 
Many financial institutions do not allow printing of sensitive documents at home and with most people working remotely documents need to be sent to various locations to get signatures, he said.

KHARTOUM/CAIRO (Reuters) - Saleha Adam had hoped things would get better after the ousting of Sudan's veteran leader Omar al-Bashir, and that more food and aid might start flowing into her ramshackle camp on the outskirts of Khartoum.
But a year and a half on, prices are still soaring. And an international package of support for the poorest households like Adam's has been delayed, leaving the government racing to stave off more economic turmoil.
""We heard about the (support) plan on TV,"" said Adam, who fled to Khartoum to escape fighting in Sudan's Nuba Mountains. But then nothing came of the plan. No cash arrived.
""We need help,"" said the 38-year-old.
Crises are piling up for Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok who took over after Bashir to head a shaky coalition with the military and become Sudan's first civilian premier since the 1980s.
There are the problems Hamdok inherited, including the loss of most of the country's forex-earning oil reserves with the secession of South Sudan in 2011.
There are the new disasters, chief of all the pandemic. Nile floods have also displaced tens of thousands. 
Adding to that, many of the benefits that many hoped would come with Bashir's ousting - above all an end of Sudan's pariah status and isolation from world financial markets - have been slow to emerge.
A cash transfer plan - funded by donors and administered by the World Bank to help up to 6.5 million families - was meant to start on Sept. 1. The government had expected $400 million to start the plan this month, said Adam Harika, Hamdok's economic adviser.
But the World Bank told Reuters last week the cash plan was still ""under design"". ""We are presently following up with donors on receipt of contributions as per their pledges,"" said a spokeswoman.
""The World Bank can pay its grant of up to $400 million only once they have sufficient donor funds,"" said a Western diplomat. ""Each government has its own approval, even if they committed only $20 million, and this takes time.""
While the United States said its pledge of $356.2 million will be sent by Sept. 30, Germany has only paid parts of its promised $150 million with the rest to be distributed by year-end, a government source said. The German ministry for international development said the funds were being paid gradually.
""WE ARE IN COLLAPSE RIGHT NOW""
Diplomats say donors are reluctant to hand over cash directly to the government because of transparency issues. They prefer channeling it through international organizations who take time to draw up specific aid programs.
While preparations continue, prices are rising - annual inflation hit 167% in August.
And the currency has been collapsing, weakening to 234 Sudanese pounds a dollar on the key parallel market from 140 in July. The official rate is 55.
The pound stood at 75 on the parallel market when Bashir left in April 2019.
Even some of Hamdok's triumphs have their downside. A much vaunted peace deal with rebel groups last month involved a promise of government positions for some of those insurgents and funding, pledges that will strain state budgets further. 
""It's a massive expansion of government expenditures,"" said Sudan analyst Magdi El-Gizouli. Meanwhile key exports, such as cattle to the Gulf, are declining because the haj pilgrimage where cattle are slaughtered has been downsized due to the coronavirus, El-Gizouli said, and agricultural production has been hit by a lack of fuel.
""We are in collapse right now. There is nothing to avert anymore. You have an inflationary crisis. You have a depreciating currency. You have shortages of basic commodities. You don’t even have a proper budget.""
The government has been blaming manipulation by opponents of the revolution that ousted Bashir. They declared a ""state of economic emergency"" on Thursday and launched special courts to prosecute illegal activities.
The donors who have offered support are demanding costly reforms in return, including a cut-back in popular subsidies.
Soaring food and fuel prices are where the crisis hits hardest for the people in the displacement camps clustered around the edge of the capital.
Such hardships are closely watched in Sudan - it was rising prices that fueled the protests that led to Bashir's downfall.
For now, Saleha Adam is trying to make ends meet by selling coffee and tea in a market in the center of Khartoum. But the money she earns is far from enough.

""We are all poor and displaced in my district,"" she said. ""I don't know anyone who gets state support, but we need help to cope.""

481,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 07:18AM ET</span>",U.K. Housing Is a Sick Canary in the Economic Coal Mine,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In any league table of  institutions with the keenest view of what’s happening in a local economy, banks should be ahead of the pack. So the fact British lenders are starting to exhibit a lack of faith in the U.K. housing market is a worrying barometer of how fragile the economic outlook is becoming.
Fault lines are widening. Figures published on Tuesday showed the pandemic has already wiped out almost 700,000 jobs. Some 2.7 million Britons are claiming jobless benefits, an increase of 121% since March. And escalating tension with the European Union over Brexit has increased the chances of the U.K. leaving the bloc without a trade deal, posing the danger of a chaotic change in the rules governing the relationship with Britain’s biggest export market for businesses already trying to cope with the repercussions of the pandemic. 
The prospect of the end to the government’s furlough support next month means unemployment will worsen, making it harder for people to pay their mortgages and other household bills. To defend themselves, mortgage providers are cranking up the rates they charge on home loans.
The figures in the chart above relate to home loans where the house is worth at least 25% more than the amount borrowed, known as the loan-to-value ratio. But that’s only part of the picture. Moneyfacts, a consumer data company, reckons that this month, across the entire LTV range including loans much closer to the house price, two-year fixed rates have posted their biggest jump since July 2009.
Lenders are seeking to protect themselves from a worsening economic downturn in other ways as well. The overall number of mortgage products on offer has contracted by a staggering 54% since March, Moneyfacts estimates, while the average fee charged for arranging a home loan has risen to its highest level since February 2013.
U.K. banks are clearly pulling back from the mortgage market.
This trend had nothing to do with market participants anticipating higher interest rates from the Bank of England as might usually be the case outside of a global pandemic. Last week, for the first time ever, investors were willing to pay for the privilege of lending to the U.K. government for six months. The Debt Management Office got the Friday bill auction away at an average yield of minus 0.0005%, the first negative yield at an offering of that maturity.
Two-year gilt yields, meantime, declined to a record -0.16% last week. And in the interest rate futures market, the levels on three-month contracts expiring in the coming quarters have posted a significant drop below zero in the past month.
That backdrop makes it all the more important that Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, who’s done a good job in protecting workers since the economy went into lockdown, get his next moves right. He’s currently planning an October end to paying the bulk of wages for workers furloughed by their employers, in contrast with lengthy extensions to similar programs from European neighbors including Germany, Italy and France. Halting that support at such a crucial juncture would be a mistake.
The message from both the money markets and the mortgage market suggests fiscal support is still essential. The British government needs to perform yet another U-turn to avoid a second downturn in growth in the months ahead.

482,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 06:48AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Tuesday, September 15th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- China's yuan hits a 16-month high after strong economic data that also supported oil and copper prices. The Fed starts a two-day policy meeting as the U.S. publishes industrial production data for August. Stocks are set to extend recent gains, helped by the buzz around some tech IPOs. And Hurricane Sally looks likely to spare the Gulf refining complex. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, September 15th.
1. China roars back; yuan hits 16-month high
China’s economy continued its rebound from the coronavirus pandemic, with a round of key data for August all coming in above expectations.
Retail sales returned to growth in year-on-year terms for the first time since the pandemic erupted, rising 0.5% as movie theaters and other entertainment venues reopened. Industrial production growth accelerated to 5.6% on the year from 4.8% in July, while fixed asset investment, typically the engine of Chinese growth, improved to a decline of only 0.5% on the year.
The data sent the Chinese yuan to its highest level against the dollar in 16 months, while the CSI 300 stock index rose 0.8% and the ChiNext growth stock index rose 0.9%. Copper futures also stayed strong at around $3.07 a pound.
2. U.S. industrial output due as Fed starts meeting 
The U.S. will also publish its industrial production numbers for August, at 9:15 AM ET (1315 GMT). Analysts expect a 1.0% increase on the month, while the year-on-year rate is expected to improve only modestly from an 8.2% drop through July.
In addition, there will be the Empire State Manufacturing index at 8:30 AM and the regular update from Redbook Research at 8:55 AM.
The numbers come as the Federal Reserve begins its regular two-day policy meeting. No change in key policy tools is expected, although there will be the usual scrutiny at chairman Jay Powell’s press conference for any change in its forward guidance language.
Economic data out of Europe overnight was also encouraging, with Germany’s ZEW sentiment index – the first of the big gauges of sentiment to be released – defying expectations for a fall, thanks to a sharp improvement in the assessment of current conditions.
3. Stocks set to open higher; earnings due from Fedex, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)
U.S. stock markets are indicated to open higher, extending Monday’s sharp gains, supported by conviction that the growth narrative underpinning tech stocks is still intact, and that the market’s technicals are still healthy.
By 6:40 AM ET, the Dow 30 futures contract was up 169 points, or 0.6%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was up 0.6% and Nasdaq futures were up 0.9%
Stocks in focus later will likely include Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), whose mooted deal with TikTok will face a rigorous U.S. security review. In addition, there will be earnings updates after the bell from Adobe and Fedex.
4. Buzzy tech IPOs support mood 
The confidence surrounding tech stocks is being illustrated by the course of two eagerly-expected IPOs.
Snowflake raised its IPO marketing range on Monday to $100-$110 a share, well above the initially touted $75-$85 and valuing the cloud data firm at north of $30 billion. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) Ventures are reportedly set to invest large amounts in the company through the deal.
Software company JFrog also raised its marketing range to $39-$41 a share from $33-$37 previously. At the top end of its new range, JFrog would be valued at $3.8 billion.
Both deals are set to price later Tuesday and begin trading on Wednesday.
5 Oil rebounds on China data, shrugs off IEA report
Crude oil futures regained some momentum, as the Chinese economic data helped it to shrug off yet more gloom from the International Energy Agency’s monthly report. The IEA joined OPEC in trimming its forecast for oil consumption this year, by a further 300,000 barrels a day.
By 6:40 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 1.7% at $37.90 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 1.5% at $40.22.
Newswire reports suggested that Chinese refinery runs had stayed strong in August, but noted that they may be merely serving to replace crude stockpiles with stockpiles of refined products.
Elsewhere, the risk of fresh disruption to production in the Gulf of Mexico appeared to recede as the storm front Sally was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. It’s expected to make landfall between New Orleans and the Florida panhandle, well away from the Gulf’s refining complex."

485,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 02:25AM ET</span>","China's industrial engine gathers speed, consumers open wallets in boost to recovery","By Gabriel Crossley and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's industrial output accelerated the most in eight months in August, while retail sales grew for the first time this year, suggesting the economic recovery is gathering pace as demand starts to improve more broadly from the coronavirus crisis. 
An annual decline in fixed-asset investment over January-August also moderated thanks to expanded stimulus from Beijing, but authorities remain wary about the outlook given heightened external risks, including from intensifying Sino-U.S. tensions.
After the pandemic paralysed the economy, China's recovery has been gaining momentum as pent-up demand, government stimulus and surprisingly resilient exports propel a rebound. Floods across southwestern China that disrupted production in July have receded.
""Strong external demand, a further recovery from the pandemic and pent-up demand from the floods all contributed to the robust activity data in August,"" Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, said in a note to clients. 
""We expect a further, albeit gradual, recovery of the services sector, a steady improvement in retail sales and elevated fixed-asset investment growth.""
Industrial output growth quickened to 5.6% in August from a year earlier, the fastest in eight months, data from the National Statistics Bureau showed on Tuesday. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 5.1% rise from 4.8% in July.
Retail sales also beat analysts' forecast with a 0.5% rise on-year, snapping a seven-month downturn and bettering expectations for zero growth. In July, sales dropped 1.1%, but consumer confidence has been picking up lately, from spending on automobiles and duty-free shopping.
Auto sales rose 11.8% in August year-on-year while sales of telecoms products jumped 25.1%, the data showed.
The decline in fixed-asset investment slowed, falling 0.3% in January-August from the year-ago period, compared with a forecast 0.4% slide and a larger 1.6% decline in the first seven months of the year. 
Private sector fixed-asset investment, which accounts for 60% of total investment, fell a less steep 2.8% in January-August, compared with a 5.7% decline in the first seven months. Property investment, a crucial growth driver, also jumped the most in 16 months in August.
In commodities, China posted record output in both crude steel and aluminium last month thanks to robust demand from the construction sector and recovery in automobile sales.
""We think that China’s economic recovery is on a reasonably firm footing now and should continue through Q4 and into 2021, with solid investment growth, gradually recovering consumption momentum and resilient exports,"" said Louis Kuijs at Oxford Economics.
Chinese stocks (SSEC) led Asian markets higher, while the yuan  currency rose to 16-month highs on the upbeat data. [MKTS/GLOB]
RISKS TO RECOVERY 
Recent economic indicators ranging from trade to producer prices and factory activity all suggested a further pick up in the industrial sector, and the broader economy.
Government stimulus has been a powerful domestic driver, while momentum has also been supported by Beijing's largely successful efforts to get the virus under control.
""Fiscal and monetary policy stimulus should continue to support the recovery. But we expect the impact of policy stimulus to lose some punch with credit growth easing in Q4,"" Oxford Economics' Kuijs said.
Data last week showed China's August exports marking the strongest annual gain since March 2019, as more of its trading partners eased coronavirus lockdowns.
Lu at Nomura has raised forecasts on China's third-quarter economic growth to 5.2%, versus the actual 3.2% pace in April-June, and expects fourth-quarter growth to pick up further to 5.7%.
Analysts at ANZ, meanwhile, have raised their 2020 China growth forecast to 2.1%, but the projected full-year rate would still be the weakest pace since 1976.
Some analysts fear that the recovery could stall, hurt by rising tensions between Washington and Beijing, which many expect could escalate ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.
Moreover, the possibility of another wave of local infections in the winter, and the continued rise in COVID-19 cases across a number of countries, led by India and the United States, have many investors nervous about the outlook.
Those worries were partially underscored by statistical bureau spokesman Fu Linghui, who told reporters that the economic recovery remains unbalanced. 
""Externally, there are still many unstable and uncertain factors. On the domestic side... some industries and enterprises are still facing difficulties, and the recovery is unbalanced,"" Fu said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Douyin, the Chinese version of short video app TikTok, hit 600 million daily active users in August, an executive with parent company ByteDance said on Tuesday, a 50% jump since the start of the year.
Users in China are not able to access the TikTok app, which is wildly popular with teenagers worldwide and the subject of a fierce rift between Beijing and Washington over security concerns, but can use Douyin, which is similar in design.
Four-year-old Douyin's more than 22 million creators have earned a total of 41.7 billion yuan ($6.15 billion) over the past year, ByteDance China chief executive officer Kelly Zhang said during an online conference. She said Douyin aimed to help them double that income over the next year.
Douyin's surge comes as TikTok faces a possible ban in the United States by the Trump administration, which wants ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations.
U.S.-listed  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) said on Monday it would team up with ByteDance, which could help keep TikTok operating in the United States.
Like TikTok, Douyin allows users to watch short videos and livestreams and make in-app purchases.
It is currently one of the most popular social media apps in China and its growth is seen as indicative of TikTok's potential evolution.
In comparison, China’s messaging app WeChat, which is owned by Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), said it had over 1 billion users using the app everyday in 2018. China had 1.6 billion monthly active mobile internet users as of May, according to market researcher QuestMobile.
ByteDance is considering listing its China business in Hong Kong or Shanghai, amid escalating tensions between world’s two largest economies, Reuters has reported. That listing plan was initiated after U.S. regulators started to review ByteDance’s acquisition of Musical.ly last year.

The bulk of ByteDance’s revenue is still generated in China, sources have told Reuters, mainly from ad income on Douyin and its Chinese news aggregator Jinri Toutiao.

487,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2020 01:10AM ET</span>",Google aims to run on carbon-free energy by 2030,"By Paresh Dave
OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google aims to power its data centers and offices using solely carbon-free electricity by 2030, its chief executive told Reuters, building on its previous goal of matching its energy use with 100% renewable energy.
The ""stretch goal,"" as CEO Sundar Pichai described it, will force Google to move beyond the tech industry norm of offsetting carbon emissions from electricity use and require technological and political breakthroughs to achieve.
""The problem is so immense, many of us need to lead the way and show solutions,"" Pichai said. ""We’re one small player in this but we can set an example.""
Wildfires burning a record area in the western United States this month have increased public awareness of climate change, Pichai said, and Google wants to bring further attention through its new goal as well as product features.
Wind, solar and other renewable sources accounted for 61% of Google's global hourly electricity usage last year. The proportion varied by facility, with carbon-free sources fulfilling 96% of hourly power needs at Google's wind-swept Oklahoma data center compared with 3% at its gas-reliant Singapore operation. 
But Google, which consumes slightly more power annually worldwide than residents and businesses in Delaware, has grown optimistic that it can bridge the gap with batteries to store solar power overnight, emerging sources such as geothermal reservoirs and better management of power needs.
""To plan 24/7 hourly being carbon-free in our data centers and campuses around the world, we see an enormous logistics challenge, which is why we've been hard at work modeling the last year how to get there,"" Pichai said. ""And we feel confident we can get there by 2030.""
He declined to share the likely cost of achieving the goal.
Big Google rivals including  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) have targeted removing more carbon from the atmosphere than they emit over the coming decades, but none of them have publicly set a goal to stop sourcing carbon-based energy.
But the companies share a common goal of catalyzing businesses and governments to curb climate pollution before 2030, when scientists say global warming could become catastrophic if unchecked.
Jennifer Layke, global director at research group World Resources Institute, which has received Google funding, said the company inspired others in the United States and Europe over the last decade but its efforts must now spur action in crucial polluting regions such as China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam.
""If we can't shift from carbon, we will suffer the firestorms and the droughts,"" she said. 
Google has been carbon-neutral since 2007, meaning it has planted trees, bought carbon credits and funded large amounts of wind power in places where it is abundant to offset its tapping of coal and natural gas power in other regions. It also said Monday that its estimated 1 million metric tons of emissions between 2006 and its 1998 launch now have been offset.
The company's new goals include bringing 5 gigawatts of renewable energy near some suppliers, funding tree planting beyond its offset needs and sharing data or forging partnerships with 500 governments around the world to try to cut 1 gigaton of carbon emissions annually by 2030.
Google said it would continue to offset carbon emissions unrelated to electricity use, such as from employee travel.
Its carbon-free electricity goal satisfies one demand of 2,000 Google employees who last November petitioned the company to stop selling data storage and other cloud computing tools to oil companies and funding think tanks or politicians who deny the existence of climate change.
On Monday, several employees who signed the petition said Google risks undermining its new goals if it keeps supporting customers and politicians exacerbating global warming.
""Today's announcement is a step in the right direction, but the urgency of the situation demands more,"" employees said in a statement.

Pichai said Google would continue to ""support everyone"" with its cloud services and help oil and gas companies transition to tapping other sources.

488,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 11:45PM ET</span>",Japan's new leadership agenda could make jobs a bigger BOJ priority,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's central bank is likely to stress its readiness to help the government protect jobs this week, in a nod to expected new premier Yoshihide Suga's resolve to do whatever it takes to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic.
Analysts expect no major change to the relationship between the Bank of Japan and an administration led by Suga who, as Shinzo Abe's right-hand man, spearheaded the departing prime minister's strategy to revive the economy with bold monetary and fiscal measures.
However, Suga's emphasis on protecting employment could prod the BOJ to pay more attention to the job market in conducting monetary policy - even though employment is not a part of the BOJ's official mandate.
A new focus on jobs away from consumer inflation could be more important now as some of Suga's flagship policies, such as a discount campaign to promote domestic tourism and calls to cut cellphone charges, are seen weighing on prices, analysts say.
""Due to the pandemic, any efforts to achieve the price target have been shelved for now,"" said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research.
""The BOJ will focus on liquidity provision and credit easing measures to help companies and workers cope with the pandemic.""
In a meeting concluding a day after Wednesday's parliament vote officially elects Suga as Japan's new leader, the BOJ is set to maintain its ultra-easy policy and offer a slightly more upbeat view on the economy than in July.
Markets are focusing on what BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda would say at his post-meeting briefing on how the central bank intends to coordinate monetary policy with a new administration.
NEW BATTLES
The BOJ is mandated by law to achieve price and financial system stability, but does not have a target on jobs growth as the U.S. Federal Reserve does.
As the pandemic crushes the economy, however, the BOJ has already detached its policy moves from the price goal. Deputy Governor Masazumi Wakatabe said earlier this month the BOJ may need to focus more on jobs in guiding policy.
Kuroda is likely to reiterate the BOJ's resolve to work hand-in-hand with the government in cushioning the economic blow from the pandemic with a huge dose of fiscal and monetary support.
But there is uncertainty on how long the honeymoon will last with a dearth of policy tools seen binding the BOJ's hands if it comes under renewed pressure to ramp up stimulus, analysts say.
""Having played the firefighter role as Abe's chief cabinet secretary, Suga may pressure the BOJ to ease if the yen spikes"" and hurts Japan's export-reliant economy, said Ryutaro Kono, chief Japan economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
""But the BOJ will find it hard to cut interest rates as that would hurt regional banks and risk triggering a credit crunch.""
The mounting cost of battling the pandemic may also force the BOJ to gobble up more government bonds, pushing it closer to debt monetisation and putting its independence on the line.

""If the government keeps spending at the current pace, Japan may soon face the question of how to sustainably finance its huge fiscal deficit,"" said Yasuhide Yajima, chief economist at NLI Research Institute. ""That may test the BOJ's now cozy relationship with the government.""

The region’s gross domestic product will decline by 0.7% in 2020, down from June’s projection of an increase of 0.1%, the Manila-based bank said in a report Tuesday. A contraction this year would be the first since 1962, Yasuyuki Sawada, the ADB’s chief economist, said in a live-streamed briefing.
“The economic threat posed by the Covid-19 pandemic remains potent, as extended first waves or recurring outbreaks could prompt further containment measures,” Sawada said. Downturns across developing Asia are more widespread than previous crises, with three-quarters of economies in the region tipped to shrink this year, he said.
China will buck the trend and is forecast to expand 1.8% this year -- unchanged from June’s projection -- as successful public health measures provide a springboard for growth, according to the ADB. Growth is forecast to accelerate to 7.7% in 2021, up from a previous forecast of 7.4%.
In India, where lockdowns have stalled private spending, GDP will shrink by 9% this year, sharply down from June’s forecast of -4%, the ADB said. There were also big downgrades for the Philippines and Thailand, which are now projected to contract 7.3% and 8% respectively.
Growth in Developing Asia -- a region that excludes advanced nations like Japan, Australia and New Zealand -- will rebound to 6.8% in 2021, in part because it will be measured against a weak 2020, Sawada said. That will still leave next year’s level of GDP below pre-coronavirus projections, implying that the recovery is only “partial” and “not full.”
Virus containment “seems to be translated into growth performance,” and a prolonged pandemic remains the biggest downside risk this year and the next, he said.
U.S.-China trade tensions and technology conflicts and financial vulnerabilities amid the pandemic also weigh on growth, Sawada said.
Policies focused on protecting lives and livelihoods, and ensuring a safe return to work and restart of businesses, are crucial to ensuring a sustained recovery for the region, he said.

MANILA (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic will cause economic output in ""developing Asia"" to shrink for the first time in nearly six decades in 2020 before it bounces back next year, the Asian Development Bank said on Tuesday. 
""Developing Asia"", which groups 45 countries in Asia-Pacific, is expected to contract 0.7% this year, the ADB said, forecasting the first negative quarterly figure since 1962. The ADB's previous forecast in June had reckoned on 0.1% growth. 
For 2021, the region is forecast to recover and grow 6.8%, still below pre-COVID-19 predictions, the ADB said in an update of its Asian Development Outlook report.
The updated forecasts show the damage brought by the pandemic was greater than previously thought, with about three-quarters of the region's economies forecast to slump this year. 
""Most economies in the Asia and Pacific region can expect difficult growth path for the rest of 2020,"" ADB Chief Economist Yasuyuki Sawada said in a statement. 
""The economic threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic remains potent, as extended first waves or recurring outbreaks could prompt further containment measures,"" Sawada said. 
While the pandemic remains the biggest downside risk to the region's outlook, Sawada said in a separate media briefing ""worsening geopolitical tensions"" that include the trade and tech war between U.S. and Beijing, could also dent growth. 
China, where the coronavirus surfaced in December, is seen bucking the trend as the ADB kept its 2020 growth forecast at 1.8%. The world's second largest economy is expected to rebound strongly to 7.7% in 2021, the ADB said.
India's economy is expected to contract 9.0% this year, ADB said, a far worse outcome than the 4.0% contraction previously forecast, ADB said. But it also expected India to bounce back with 8.0% growth next year. 
As the pandemic took a toll on Southeast Asian economies, the sub-region is projected to suffer a 3.8% slump this year, before picking up next year. 
Latest forecasts suggest a more protracted ""L"" shaped recovery for ""developing Asia"", Sawada said.
Depressed demand and lower oil prices allowed the ADB to keep its inflation forecast for developing Asia at 2.9%, and it is predicted to slow further to 2.3% in 2021.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors yanked almost $24 billion out of cash funds in the past week to redirect money into emerging markets, while slowing down on chasing the summer's winners, technology and gold, BofA's weekly fund flow statistics showed on Friday.
BofA analysts, citing data for the week to Sept. 9 from financial flow tracking firm EPFR, said they saw a ""laggard rotation"" with year-to-date underperformers, such as emerging market stocks, attracting $3.4 billion, the largest in nine weeks.
The United States, Europe and Japan meanwhile all saw moderate outflows with Wall Street's growth stocks being dumped the most with $4.1 billion in outflows.
Wall Street's tech- and stimulus-led rally came to a screeching halt last week as investors booked profits after a run that boosted the tech-heavy Nasdaq index about 70% from its pandemic lows.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) - together known as ""FAATMAN"" - collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization between Sept. 2 and Sept. 8.
BofA said this month's fragility in stock markets was in part caused by a high concentration of tech stocks and the rising influence of retail investors, who grabbed the spotlight in recent months as markets have rallied in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. More than 50% of the 7.2% return on the S&P 500 index in August was from just 10 tech stocks. 
BofA however said it does not see a bear market coming, with the U.S. central bank ""so easy"" and Wall Street ""flush with cash"". 
The bank suggests selling if the S&P 500 crosses 3,600 points. The index scaled 3,588 on Sept. 2 and has since lost nearly 7%.
Separately, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said it had upped global equity allocations to ""overweight"" for the next three months after the recent pullback, citing an inflection in earnings growth and a catch-up by cyclical stocks, which had lagged the summer rally.

The bank has planned $1 billion in incremental investments this year to shore up the bank's infrastructure and improve risk management and compliance, Mason said at an investor conference. 
For the third quarter, the bank expects to continue adding to its reserves for loan losses in light of a weaker economic outlook due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. 
However, the build is likely to be significantly lower than in the first half of the year when the bank set aside over $7 billion a quarter for potential losses.
Overall, the bank forecasts quarterly revenue to decline in the high single digits compared to last year due to lower interest rates and a slowdown in investment banking and consumer activity.

Trading continued to be a bright spot, showing low double-digit growth for the quarter, Mason said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mauricio Claver-Carone, the first U.S. citizen elected to lead Latin America's main development bank, vowed on Monday to focus on strengthening its funding base and building more unity in the region after a contentious election.
In his first interview since Saturday's election, Claver-Carone, a Trump loyalist and Cuba hard-liner, said his 67% victory gave him a strong mandate to lead the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).
He stressed the need for unity and increased transparency at a time when Latin America and the Caribbean are reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, and downplayed prospects for his removal if Democrat Joe Biden should win the Nov. 3 presidential election.
Claver-Carone will take office on Oct. 1 and has pledged to serve only one five-year term. 
In the run-up to the election, the IDB vote took on the appearance of a geopolitical battle between the Trump administration, which is keen to gain leverage in resource-rich Latin America and counter the rise of China, and some regional powers who wanted to retain control of the lender's top job.
The bank has been led by Latin Americans since its inception in 1959, while the World Bank has historically been led by a U.S. citizen. Upending that tradition marked a further attack on multilateralism by U.S. President Donald Trump, critics argue.
Claver-Carone said he had already spoken with officials in Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica and Mexico, which sought to delay the vote until after the U.S. election, and assured them he would work with them to make the bank more ""financially relevant"", transparent and representative.
Sixteen countries abstained from the vote, including European countries that have voting shares in the bank. China and another country did not participate in the vote.
Claver-Carone said he planned to assemble a diverse leadership team to head the bank within a month after taking office, but denied news reports that he had already promised certain plum jobs to people in Brazil and elsewhere.
""I did not offer anyone a position at any time during this campaign process,"" he said, adding that he would work with the IDB's board to fill the top jobs after he took office.
Claver-Carone said he was keen to ensure that Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, was better represented in line with its shareholding in the bank, but any jobs would be based the candidates' qualifications.
He said he did not expect Biden to try to oust him if Trump lost the election. Any effort to do so would result in ""a months-long acrimonious, divisive, paralyzing, counterproductive process,"" he said.
""After the campaign, I have no doubt that we will all govern as Americans,"" he said, adding that he would also execute the will of the board with regard to any policies toward Cuba.
Biden campaign spokesman Michael Gwin underscored the importance of the IDB in helping the region weather the COVID-19 pandemic.
""If Biden's elected he'll certainly review its role to ensure the effectiveness of that work,"" he said.
Mark Feierstein, a senior adviser to former President Barack Obama, said opposition to Claver-Carone from the vice chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee could make it difficult to win congressional approval to increase funding for the bank.
Claver-Carone said the urgent needs of the region required a more cohesive, unified response than in the past, and more coordination among international financial institutions.
""At the end of the day, the mandate that we have as a result of this election is towards making it a more financially relevant institution,"" he said.

He said he would work closely with the World Bank, also headed by a Trump nominee, and the International Monetary Fund to better coordinate their work on countries in the region, beginning with a high-level meeting on Oct. 2, a day after he takes office.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The global economy is unlikely to worsen due to the coronavirus pandemic even as countries face a second wave of infections, Qatar's commerce minister said on Monday, forecasting a recovery somewhere between a 'U' and 'V' shape. 
Over 29 million people have been infected worldwide by the virus and close to a million people have died. Governments have kept people home and shuttered businesses under strict restrictions to curb the virus from spreading.
""I think we have already seen the (economic) impact (of the pandemic). Is it going to get worse? I don't think so,"" Commerce and Industry Minister Ali bin Ahmed al-Kuwari told Reuters by phone.
""It's a different world today than ... when the pandemic started,"" he said.
Governments were better prepared today than when the virus broke out, having invested in boosting their health sectors and their economies, he said.
The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on the world economy, with economic output crashing and financial markets initially plunging as restrictions curtailed travel, leisure and social life.
A wave of new infections from Australia to Israel has brought renewed uncertainty as to when the global economy will recover from a virus that has seen many industries grind to a near-halt.
Kuwari said he expected the recovery to be faster than a gradual rebound but slower than a sharp uptick, though cautioned it would depend on when a vaccine for the virus could be found.

""I think we're going to be looking at something between a 'V' and 'U' -shaped recovery,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) will broadcast an event from its Cupertino, California campus on Tuesday where analysts expect it to show updated Apple Watches, iPads and other devices while reserving an iPhone launch for next month.
Despite pandemic-related disruptions that Apple executives have said will push the release of the iPhone into October, Apple has posted earnings that beat expectations for the past two quarters powered in part by strong sales of work-from-home items such as iPads and laptops and accessories that pair with its flagship smart phones.
While analysts expect an October event for iPhones, Apple teased at new watches with a ""Time Flies"" caption for its Tuesday event invite sent last week, and analysts expect a new flagship Apple Watch Series 6. Apple has come to dominate the market for smart watches, with Strategy Analytics reporting in May that Apple had 55% market share as of the first quarter.
Because the watch must be paired with an iPhone, analysts believe it plays a strong role in helping Apple retain customers, with longtime Apple Watcher Gene Munster of Loup Ventures saying last week that the 9% of iPhone owners that now own an Apple Watch could expand to 50% in the next decade.
Analysts expect Apple to dive deeper into health and fitness features with the watch. Bloomberg previously reported https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-13/apple-readies-apple-one-subscription-bundles-to-boost-services that Apple plans to unveil a service offering virtual fitness classes in which the watch could play a role as part of a larger bundle of content and services.
Some analysts also believe Apple might build a way to sense changes in blood oxygen into its newest watches, building on health sensing capabilities after adding a way to take measurements similar to electrocardiogram with its Series 4 watches. However, many prominent Apple analysts and watchers have not confirmed the feature. Apple rival  Fitbit Inc  (N:FIT) introduced a way to measure changes in blood oxygen earlier this year.
Apple declined to comment on future products.
Analysts also expect Apple to unveil an update to its iPad Air, which sits between the high-end iPad Pro that has a 3D sensor for augmented reality content and the base model iPad aimed at the education market.
Analysts also expect a new set of over-ear headphones called ""AirPods Studio"" to complement the company's AirPods and AirPods Pro wireless ear buds, which have become runaway hits for the company.
""While AirPods Studio will be a rounding error in terms of revenue contribution, they represent yet another example of the company integrating a new product into its hardware-software ecosystem,"" Munster wrote in a blog post last week.

Analysts also expect a set of small devices called AirTags, meant to be attached to devices so their owners locate them using Bluetooth and other wireless sensors. Those devices will compete against Tile Inc, an independent company founded in 2012 that created a similar product and has publicly criticized Apple for putting roadblocks in its iPhone operating system that make products from third-party developers harder to use than Apple's own products.

Layoffs have been higher among workers in industries that can be automated, which increases the risk those jobs will become permanently obsolete, according to the study by economists Lei Ding and Julieth Saenz Molina. At the same time, the spread of Covid-19 has accelerated automation in industries that have been hit hard by the virus or that don’t permit remote work.
The longer the recession lasts, the deeper the impact of automation will be.
“In case the COVID-19 crisis evolves into a prolonged economic crisis, many job losses in automatable occupations could become permanent in the post-pandemic economy, similar to what happened during the recovery from the Great Recession,” Ding and Saenz Molina wrote.
Industries that were already facing a high risk of automation lost 4.2 more jobs per 100 than jobs in sector facing fewer threats by technology, the study shows, which analyzes data through August. Jobs most at risk of being replaced by machines include hotel desk clerks, shuttle drivers, retail salespersons, parking attendants, slaughterhouse workers and toll collectors, according to the study.
The effect was more pronounced for minority workers. Automatable jobs held by minority workers experienced 5.1 more job losses per 100 jobs than those held by non-Hispanic Whites, the study found.

Other factors that have changed since June include ""higher probability of disappointment on fiscal stimulus"" to bolster the coronavirus-hit economy as Republicans and Democrats in Washington remain far apart, and an uncertain election period, which could ""drive a flight-to-quality premium in Treasuries,"" according to the report.
Morgan Stanley also said with its expectations diminished for a near-term rise in 30-year yields, it recommended taking off yield curve steepeners such as long five-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) versus short 30-year nominals and continued to suggest holding long five-year TIPS trade outright.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders told Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday to open up markets, respect minorities and step back from a crackdown in Hong Kong, also asserting that Europe would no longer be taken advantage of in trade.
Anxious to show that the EU will not take sides in a global standoff between China and the United States, German Chancellor Angela Merkel joined the bloc's chief executive and chairman to deliver a tough-talking message to Beijing.
""Europe is a player, not a playing field,"" European Council President Charles Michel, who chaired the video summit, told reporters in reference to a growing sense in Europe that China has not met its promises to engage in fair and free trade.
With more than a billion euros a day in bilateral trade, the EU is China's top trading partner, while China is second only to the United States as a market for EU goods and services.
China's response to EU demands was unclear. It was not part of the post-summit news conference and there was no joint statement.
But the European Union accuses China of breaking a host of global trade rules, from overproduction of steel to stealing Western intellectual property, which Beijing denies.
European attitudes have also hardened towards Beijing because of the novel coronavirus, which many scientists believe originated in China, and because of a new security law on Hong Kong that the West says curtails basic rights.
""We are really serious about having access to the Chinese market and tearing down the barriers,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at the news conference.
Merkel said she and her two EU colleagues had pressed Xi to be clear about whether it really wanted an investment agreement that is being negotiated between the two and which would force China to open up its markets.
""We put on pressure ... to make progress on the investment agreement,"" Merkel told reporters from Berlin.
""Overall, cooperation with China must be based on certain principles - reciprocity, fair competition. We are different social systems, but while we are committed to multilateralism, it must be rules-based,"" she added.
The demand for a level playing field was justified today given China's economic transformation in the past 15 years, Merkel said.
The EU also wants stronger commitments on climate change from China, the world's top polluter.
The EU and China did sign a deal to protect each other's exported food and drinks items from feta cheese to Pixian bean paste.

While modest, the new deal is a trade coup for Europe as U.S., Australian or New Zealand producers will no longer be able to use the protected names on their exports to China, although there is a transition period for certain cheeses.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union is set to delay a decision on allowing clearing houses in London to continue clearing euro transactions for EU-based clients due to Britain's plan to breach part of the Brexit divorce settlement, a derivatives industry source said.
The delay is one of the first warning shots from the EU as UK lawmakers vote later on Monday on a bill that would breach parts of Britain's Withdrawal Agreement from the bloc.
Brussels had said it would grant Britain ""time-limited"" access to euro derivatives clearing from January to avoid huge disruption to markets as a unit of the  London Stock Exchange  (LSE) (L:LSE) clears over 90% euro-denominated swaps that are widely used by companies.
The European Commission was due to formally take that decision later this week, but is now expected to delay it until around the end of the month, the source said, citing an industry meeting late last week with a European Commission official.
The Commission had no immediate comment.
The delay was linked to Britain's perceived unpicking of the Withdrawal Agreement it signed with the bloc, the source added.
Britain left the EU in January and transition arrangements that still allow unfettered access to the bloc end on Dec. 31.
Without legal certainty of access to the EU, the LSE's clearing unit LCH must give its clients in the bloc three-months' notice to move billions of euros worth of swaps positions out of Britain.
Euro clearing has long been a battleground between Britain, to keen to preserve London's clout as a global finance hub, and EU policymakers, who believe the bulk of activity should reside in the euro zone under the eye of the European Central Bank.
But moving large swaps positions from LCH to rivals such as Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn)'s Eurex in Frankfurt in a short time would be costly for banks and unnerve markets.
Brussels had therefore opted to allow more time for this to happen, although it had not said how much time.

If Britain's bill to override parts of its Brexit divorce settlement becomes law it could sour its attempts to have access to other financial activities in the bloc such as trading shares.

Ultra-easy monetary and fiscal support is helping companies avoid a liquidity crunch after the pandemic closed down businesses and demand collapsed. But that stance bears risks longer-term, said Claudio Borio, head of the Basel-based institution’s Monetary and Economic Department.
“There’s a delicate balance to be struck between on the one hand withdrawing it too early, which will obliviously have short-term costs in terms of economic activity, and withdrawing it too late, which will mean that it will not favor necessary structural adjustments,” he said on Monday.
Officials in Europe and the U.S. have unleashed unprecedented easing in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, which has pushed up equity markets even as economies face their deepest recession in decades.
While the liquidity measures have helped companies stay afloat, there are concerns they may also be creating a swathe of uncompetitive firms that hold back investment and innovation.
“The real challenge is to distinguish between viable and non-viable firms, which, given the uncertainty about future demand patterns, is not straightforward,” Borio said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Market turmoil due to coronavirus lockdowns in March raises questions about whether central banks should offer access to liquidity more widely in future shocks, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said on Monday.
The BIS, a forum for the world's central banks, said in a quarterly review article that banks' cross-border claims on so-called non-banks - like insurers, clearing houses, money market funds and hedge funds - rocketed by 63% to $7.5 trillion between the first quarter of 2015 and the end of March this year.
The increase in links with non-banks was concentrated at lenders in the United States, Britain, the Cayman Islands, and Japan.
""The market turmoil unleashed by the COVID-19 shock brought to the fore vulnerabilities associated with these links,"" the BIS said.
It led to margins or cash requirements to back trades at clearing houses worsening swings in prices and draining banks of money at an inopportune time, the BIS said.
It also showed that money market funds, used by banks and companies for day-to-day cash management, can be ""fickle"" funding providers, it added.
The sheer size of non-banks and their links to lenders warrants continued monitoring by the authorities, the BIS said.
""The fact that some non-bank financial institutions face a substantially different regulatory environment compared with banks – as well as no or limited formal access to central bank liquidity or public sector credit guarantees – only heightens this need,"" it added.
Central banks have said that money market funds, meant to be low risk places to hold cash, would have had to suspend themselves without central banks like the Federal Reserve providing emergency liquidity.
The article bolsters the case made by central banks that regulatory reforms may be needed to ensure that non-banks hold enough liquidity to cope better in market shocks and avoid undermining the wider financial system but stops short of specifying any measures.
Securities regulators, which directly supervise funds, have been more cautious about jumping to reforms, with broad consensus needed for a global sector.
Claudio Borio, the head of BIS Monetary and Economic Department, said it was clear there can be tension between regulators over market finance, but the question of whether additional rules were needed and possible will be looked at very closely.
""There is scope to adopt a more systemic approach to regulation of this sector which looks in particular at the impact these institutions can have on the financial system as a whole,"" Borio told reporters.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union announced on Monday it will extend until March 27 a waiver of the requirement that airlines use 80% of their take-off and landing slots, to help an industry still suffering from the impact of the coronavirus crisis.
The waiver was put in place to avoid airlines operating empty ""ghost flights"" to keep their slots. European Transport Commissioner Adina Valean said a study showed demand was not likely to pick up fast enough to lift it.
""Today's report shows that air traffic levels remain low, and more importantly, they are not likely to recover in the near future,"" she said in a statement.
""In this context, the lack of certainty over slots makes it difficult for airlines to plan their schedules, making planning difficult for airports and passengers.""
Valean also urged airlines to start thinking about a return to a normal slot regime once air traffic picks up again, and said she hoped to present a proposal on this before the end of the year. She noted that the requirement that airlines use their slots was important for efficiency and fair competition.

""Slots are not always relinquished in time for other users or airports to plan operations as they would like; competition may also be distorted if airlines seek to benefit by increasing their market presence without using their slots and airport capacity correctly,"" she said.

510,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>","UK faces biggest wave of redundancies in a generation, think-tank says","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is on course to suffer the biggest increase in redundancies in a generation in the second half of 2020, based on lay-off notifications by employers hit by the coronavirus shock to the economy, a think tank said on Monday.
Around 650,000 people, and potentially a lot more, were likely to be made redundant in Britain between July and December, the Institute for Employment Studies, an independent research organisation. 
""Sadly, much of this restructuring appears now to be inevitable,"" it said.
Layoff notifications were running at more than double the levels of the 2008/9 recession and around 450,000 redundancies could occur in the July-September period - 50% more than the quarterly peak during the global financial crisis.
However, it was not inevitable that the high level of redundancies would lead to mass unemployment if people were able to find jobs with new employers, the IES said.
The government should cut the costs of employment to boost hiring and provide ""tightly targeted"" wage support in industries and areas that remain viable in the longer-term, the IES said.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak has resisted calls to extend his coronavirus job retention scheme which is due to expire at the end of October. 
Employers' groups are urging him to cut social security contributions to soften the expected rise in unemployment.
The IES said its forecasts were based on data from employers planning 20 or more redundancies.
Official labour market figures due on Tuesday are expected to show Britain's jobless rate rose in the three months to July for the first time having held at 3.9% since the COVID-19 lockdown began in March. 

More up-to-date figures from Britain's tax office are expected to reveal further job losses on top of the surge of 730,000 reported between March and July.

511,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 07:21AM ET</span>",Fed meeting may give clues to coronavirus-era jobs plans,"By Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eight years ago, as the United States struggled through the aftermath of a deep recession, the Federal Reserve set an unemployment rate it felt would be a good benchmark to show the economy was getting back to normal.
The 6.5% number the Fed set in 2012 was almost double the unemployment rate the U.S. eventually hit https://br.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idUSKBN1WJ0C4 during a record-setting economic expansion, leaving many convinced the Fed had misjudged the willingness of those on the economic sidelines to get back to work. 
This week, the Fed will revive that debate under drastically different circumstances as it begins to put into practice a revised approach to monetary policy at its meeting on Sept. 15 and 16. Mistakes about job creation are a thing of the past, the Fed is promising, with an expansive commitment to ""broad-based and inclusive"" employment announced in late August. 
What's unclear is just what the Fed plans to do to speed a return to full employment for the nearly 30 million Americans collecting some form of unemployment benefit, and when it will pull the trigger. The issues are consequential to Wall Street investors, businesses large and small, masses of jobless in America, and possibly the November presidential election.
This week's meeting won't provide those answers. But there should be clues from the new economic projections that Fed officials will issue after their meeting, the last before the November election, and from the press conference chair Jerome Powell holds afterward.
The Fed may eventually buy more bonds, offer more detailed promises to keep credit easy for years to come, or even take more aggressive steps if the pandemic worsens and conditions deteriorate.
To veterans of those earlier policy debates about maximum employment, it can't happen soon enough.
Despite the new employment commitments, lending programs and low interest rates rolled out in response to the pandemic this spring, ""we are settling in for another long painful recovery where some people are feeling great because they own lots of stock and others lost their job,"" said Dartmouth College economics professor and former Fed adviser Andrew Levin. 
""It is deja vu"" with the last U.S. recovery, he said. 
New economic projections this week will offer the first, longer-term glimpse, through 2023, of how Fed officials think their new approach will work in practice and how fast they think the job market can recover. 
The formal unemployment rate of 8.4% in August is already below what most Fed officials felt it would be at year's end. But it also may understate the real economic impact the coronavirus has had on households. 
This week should reveal whether Fed officials think the pace of improvement will continue, and how that shapes their view of the recovery.
WORSE THAN THE LAST RECESSION
It took six and a half years for the U.S. to reclaim the 8.7 million payroll jobs lost during the 2007 to 2009 downturn. The coronavirus recession was deeper and faster, with 22 million payroll positions lost. 
The rebound started strong, but there are concerns it is slowing and may leave people struggling in a post-pandemic economy where millions of jobs may have been rendered obsolete. 
The Fed's future decisions and deliberations will likely reflect new views of the labor market, developed during the last downturn and recovery. 
Levin, for example, was among a group of economists who argued that workers who appeared permanently sidelined might return to jobs if unemployment fell low enough. The issue may again be relevant if some industries and occupations, as expected, are fundamentally changed as a result of the pandemic.
Evidence of such structural changes can take time. Though Levin proved correct, it took years before sidelined workers' return showed up in the data. Some feel the Fed's reduction of economic stimulus and hiking of interest rates in the meantime slowed the arrival of the day when the recovery reached those most marginalized -- the people the Fed is now pledging to more directly account for in its thinking.
U.S. central bankers say they have learned their lesson. They have revised their approach so that the risk, say, of rising inflation will no longer be used as a reason to raise interest rates and slow job creation - until it is clearly necessary. 
In the expansion that lasted until the coronavirus ""we did find full employment,"" San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly said in recent comments to reporters. ""We were learning to find it experientially"" by letting joblessness drop below what was considered sustainable without inflation.
That is the Fed's intent for the future. Those on the outside are hungry for more details.

“What the Fed has told us is they are no longer going to even pretend to be anticipatory,"" raising rates to halt inflation before it starts, said Erik Weisman, chief economist with MFS Investment Management. ""We are going to want a lot more specificity.""

512,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>","Companies should be given 'green ratings', BIS study recommends","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Companies should be assigned credit score-style ""green ratings"" to push them to cut CO2 emissions, the central bank to the world's central banks, the Bank for International Settlements, has said.
Research in the BIS's quarterly report on Monday showed 'green bonds' were not having a lasting impact on firms' ""carbon intensities"" as they often tended to rebound after an initial dip.
Therefore, a rating system that focused on a company's overall CO2 efficiency that could be used by investors and policymakers to compare firms would provide a better incentive.
""Overall, there is no strong evidence that green bond issuance is associated with any reduction in carbon intensities over time at the firm level,"" the BIS researchers that carried out the study of thousands of firms wrote.
""Rewarding a reduction in carbon intensity (with a rating system) is an effective way to reduce firm-level carbon emissions, without incentivising firms to reduce economic activity or split up operations.""
Carbon reporting currently distinguishes between three different types of emissions, also known as 'scopes'.
Scope 1 covers emissions from owned or controlled resources of a firm. Scope 2 encompasses indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy, eg. electricity, while scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions such as input products, employee travel and distribution systems.
Governments around the world are looking at how to harness the power of financial markets in the fight against climate change.
The European Union is finalising a key part of the bloc's Sustainable Finance Taxonomy, which will define which investments can be considered green, while central banks are also looking at bumping up greener firms and penalising polluters in asset purchase programmes or lending operations.
Assuming global investors now have a preference for greener business models, the BIS study said firms that climbed the new green rating ladder would most likely see lower funding costs.
It proposed a 10-bucket rating 'grid' including five buckets just for the 10% of firms with the highest carbon intensity. The labels would start from GGGGG for the greenest firms to PPPPP for the worst polluters.
""The incentives of firms should be aligned with climate goals,"" the report said.

LONDON (Reuters) - There is growing ""daylight"" between stock markets and other risky financial market asset classes and the reality of a global economy sapped by COVID-19, the Bank for International Settlements said in its quarterly report on Monday.
""Based on a broad set of indicators, it is hard not to see a certain amount of daylight between risky asset prices and economic prospects,"" Claudio Borio, Head of the BIS Monetary and Economic Department, said.
""We don't really know exactly how the tensions are going to be resolved. There is quite a lot of uncertainty about how the virus will evolve and that will have big implications for financial markets and policy in general,"" Borio added.
Global stock markets have risen than 50% since plunging in February and March and bond market tensions have also receded considerably, despite the brutal slump the global economy is facing this year.
Borio added that the withdrawal of accommodation was ""not for today for tomorrow or even for the day after tomorrow,"" but would need to be phased out at some point.
For now, the most difficult phase of the COVID crisis was still ahead, however. ""We are transitioning from the liquidity phase to the solvency phase"".
""In the solvency phase the real challenge is to distinguish between viable and non-viable firms that given the uncertainty about future demand patterns is not straightforward.""
There is also the ""big"" debt crisis question he said as countries have ramped there spending to try and support their economies. 
""This is very much a policy challenge going forward,"" Borio said.

The U.S-EU deal covers products including U.S. lobsters and EU glassware and ceramics valued at $200 million of annual trade, a tiny fraction of the 616 billion euros (568.32 billion pounds)of transatlantic goods trade in 2019.
Dombrovskis, who is set to take charge of trade at the EU executive, said the deal, the first tariff reductions of this type in more than two decades, was small in economic terms, but big politically.
However, he cautioned against expecting further such small deals, partly because of differences of views about whether to include agriculture as part of trade talks.
""Currently there are no new mini-deals imminent,"" he told a seminar organised by BusinessEurope. ""We had been very clear that our mandate only covers industrial goods, whereas the U.S. wants to include agriculture.""
Fish products are considered industrial goods.
However, Dombrovskis did say he hoped the deal would serve as a ""springboard for greater things"".
The commissioner said the European Union particularly wanted to resolve a long-running dispute over civil aircraft subsidies.
The United States has already received authorisation from the World Trade Organization to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU goods over subsidies given to European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR).
However, the EU is expected to learn within weeks from the WTO the level of retaliatory tariffs it can impose over subsidies given to Boeing (N:BA).
""Instead of imposing tariffs, I want to find solutions,"" Dombrovskis said, adding he had already spoken to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.

515,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>",Brexit risk premium returns to UK markets,"By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - The latest bout of sabre-rattling between Britain and the EU is upping the premium investors demand for holding UK assets for fear of a chaotic Brexit outcome with hugely damaging consequences for the economy.
The pound is down 4% against the dollar this month. Now as the UK parliament starts debating legislation that defies international law by breaching the EU divorce treaty, British shares, option markets and bonds are also swiftly pricing the Brexit premium.
The pricing of Brexit risk is filtering through to interest rate futures and inflation expectations too. Here are some examples of the Brexit premium:
1) STERLING IMPLIED VOLATILITY
Implied volatility, options that show investor expectations of future price swings in a currency, has shot up on sterling/dollar. One-month volatility, or 'vol' in trader parlance, is at five-month highs around 12% -- well above implied vol on other G7 currencies.
The one-month vol spike has sent it above the 12-month gauge, inverting the options curve for the first time since March and implying a rise in near-term risks. 
Graphic: Pound implied volatility rises on fresh Brexit tensions - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxxzjqpx/Pasted%20image%201599825490646.png
Options called risk reversals too show the implied vol premium to buy sterling 'puts' over 'calls' has risen sharply this month. 
Graphic: Options markets shift towards pricing a ""no-deal"" Brexit - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jznvnxrqjvl/Pasted%20image%201599826575928.png
2) EQUITY RISK
Since Britain voted in a June 2016 referendum to exit the EU, its stocks have underperformed. This year, the FTSE index lags the European STOXX benchmark by 17% -- partly because the former is heavy on poorly performing energy and commodity firms. But Brexit is also to blame.
Graphic: UK stocks underperform in 2020 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvglkelpq/Pasted%20image%201600069717056.png
A sector-based comparison of performance and valuations shows evidence of a Brexit premium. 
""If you look at sector differentials -- for instance UK energy or financials versus the rest of the world, you can see an additional risk premium on the UK,"" said Justin Onuekwusi, portfolio manager at Legal & General Investment Management.
""UK assets look cheap relative to rest of world.""
Graphic: UK vs. European banks valuations - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakpeobkapr/Pasted%20image%201600073207742.png
3) BORROWING PREMIUM
Investors also want a Brexit premium to lend to British companies, reflected above all in bonds issued by banks.
For instance, the gap between the yield on  Barclays  (LON:BARC)'s September 2023 euro-denominated bond and a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) note maturing the same month has widened of late to the highest in nearly three months around 38 basis points. 
Graphic: UK corporate borrowing premium - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmyvmazrrvr/Pasted%20image%201600069389000.png
ABN Amro analysts noted that spreads on euro-denominated bank bonds widened around 3 basis points last week, but UK lenders saw spreads blow out by 20-30 bps.
""We anticipate that Brexit negotiations will continue to exert negative headlines. UK risk premiums are likely to stay elevated for the remainder of this year,"" they told clients.
4) CURVE STEEPENING
Brexit premia may also be contained in a steeper UK gilt yield curve. Money markets have brought forward bets of a Bank of England rate cut, pricing negative interest rates for early-2021.

""If you looked at the UK curve relative to Bund curve, our curve is now steeper. Given the currency is unable to get cheaper and cheaper, it's easier for other things to move a little bit. The steepening in the curve offers a premium,"" Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) analyst Kit Juckes said.

4)INFLATION EXPECTATIONS
Market-based measures of future UK inflation   have ticked up, a pattern seen also after the 2016 referendum when the pound crash lifted inflation expectations.
The latest rise in inflation expectations coincided with the bout of pound weakness, suggesting it is Brexit-related and not down to COVID-19 reflation, said Viraj Patel, global macro and currency strategist at Arkera.

516,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>","Retirements, layoffs, labor force flight may leave scars on U.S economy","By Howard Schneider and Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - Judith Ramirez received a letter this month that she'd been dreading: The Honolulu hotel that furloughed her from a housekeeping job in March, during the lockdown triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, made her layoff permanent. 
Ramirez, 40, was originally told she might be called back after business picked up. But infections increased in Hawaii over the summer and quarantine restrictions for visitors were extended, a blow to the state's tourism-dependent hotels. 
Six months into the pandemic, evidence of longer-term damage to the U.S. labor market is emerging, according to separate analyses of detailed monthly jobs data by labor economists and Reuters. 
Retirements are drifting up, women aren't reengaging with the job market quickly, and ""temporary"" furloughs like Ramirez's are becoming permanent - trends that could weigh on the U.S. economic recovery in the short term as well as the country's prospects in the long term. 
Economic growth depends on how many people work. If more retire, or are kept from the job market because of childcare or health and safety issues, growth is slower.
""In the first few months of the recession we were much more focused on how many jobs could come back, how many jobs could be preserved,"" said Kathryn Anne Edwards, a labor economist at RAND Corp. ""Now the question is really how much damage has this done.""
WOMEN, OLDER WORKERS DROP OUT 
The U.S. economic drag is falling heavily on two groups, women https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-usa-women/analysis-working-women-and-especially-single-moms-are-hit-hard-by-coronavirus-downturn-idUSL1N2CP02O and older workers, who fueled https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-women/tight-u-s-labor-market-shrinks-gender-and-race-gaps-to-record-lows-idUSKCN1VR2JC a rise in labor force participation prior to the pandemic. That supported stronger-than-expected economic growth in 2018 and 2019, and showed how a historically low unemployment rate drew people back into jobs. 
Those workers may now be getting stranded. Women and workers aged 65 and older make up a disproportionate share of the 3.7 million people no longer working or actively seeking a job since the pandemic hit, Labor Department data show. 
People 65 and older made up less than 7% of the workforce in February, but 17% of those who have left the labor market through August. Women previously accounted for 47% of the workforce, but make up 54% of the departed. 
Initial evidence of longer-term trouble is starting to show in the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) that forms the basis of regular government employment reports. 
After a spike in women leaving the labor force in the early months of the pandemic, particularly to tend to family responsibilities, there's been slower movement back into jobs compared to the months before the pandemic, according to an analysis of CPS data by Nick Bunker, economic research director for North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab.
The percentage of women and men who moved from employed to out of the labor force jumped as the pandemic layoffs hit in April. The number of women, however, who cited child care or family responsibilities as the reason, increased 178%, while the number of men citing it less than doubled, Bunker's analysis showed.
The percentage of those women moving in the other direction month to month - from caring for family into a job - meanwhile has dropped, to a low of 5% in April from 6.6% in 2019, though it rose to 5.8% in July. It is lower for men too. 
The data ""suggests ... that being out of the labor force for family reasons is a 'stickier' state"" than prior to the pandemic, Bunker said.
The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College found CPS data shows a rising share of workers 65 and older are calling it quits, a development many economists expected given the risk COVID-19 poses to older people. 
Nearly a fifth of that age group working as of July 2019 were retired as of July of this year, compared to 17% for the prior year, the center's research concluded. The percentage of these workers who consider themselves ""retired"" instead of merely out of work also rose steadily in recent months, from 14.2% in April to 19.5% in June.
""It is something we expected might happen - that people who were close to retirement might transition earlier,"" said Anqi Chen, the center's assistant director for savings research. 
NOT LIKE LAST RECESSION 
The situation is rekindling debates from a decade ago about how unemployment can lead to long-term economic ""scarring,"" but the specifics are different. 
The 2007-2009 recession fell disproportionately on the male-dominated construction and manufacturing industries. The pandemic has caused more job losses in services concentrated among women, and brought the added complication of school closings and concerns about the safety of daycare centers and nursing homes.
The road back to employment may be getting harder, as suggested in the analysis of CPS data by Rand's Edwards. Of 7.6 million people ""temporarily"" laid off as of June, the number who had found jobs by July - 2.4 million - was eclipsed by the 2.8 million who either left the labor force altogether or said they were no longer expecting to get their jobs back. That's the first time in the pandemic that was the case.

Ramirez, the laid-off housekeeper, said she has been looking for a job, but not many places are hiring with travel sharply down from pre-pandemic levels and many retail stores closed. Some businesses say they have a list of furloughed employees waiting to be called back. ""There's no hiring here,"" she said. ""People don't know we are struggling.""

517,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 06:39AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday, September 14th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) wins the race for TikTok's U.S. operations, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) splashes out $40 billion to buy ARM from Softbank (OTC:SFTBY), while Gilead bets $21 billion on an experimental cancer drug. Stocks are set to open higher on more reassurances about a Covid-19 vaccine, but oil is down as BP (NYSE:BP) warns of an early peak to global oil demand. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, September 14th.
1. Oracle wins the race for TikTok
Oracle took the lead in the race to be the savior of video-streaming service TikTok’s U.S. operations, but it’s still not clear whether the deal will be acceptable to regulators in China and the U.S.
The Wall Street Journal reported that Oracle is set to be announced as TikTok’s “trusted tech partner”, and that the deal won’t be structured as an outright sale.
The deal will need the approval of both U.S. and Chinese authorities. Should they give it, it would signal the de-escalation of the two powers’ multi-faceted battle for economic supremacy. U.S. authorities will want absolute certainty that TikTok user data can’t find its way back to Beijing, while China will need to rule that the deal doesn’t contravene a recently-passed law banning the sale of certain artificial intelligence technology. The yuan rose to its highest since May on positive interpretations of the news.
2. Nvidia pays Softbank $40 billion for ARM
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) agreed to buy U.K.-based chip designer ARM for $40 billion from Softbank (T:9984). That’s around $8 billion more than Softbank paid for it five years ago.
The news propelled the Japanese venture capital company’s shares another 9.0% higher, in a fresh sign of confidence in founder Masayoshi Son’s stewardship. Confidence had been hit hard by high-profile investment losses in companies such as WeWork and Uber (NYSE:UBER).
Over half of purchase price will be paid in the form of Nvidia stock, giving Softbank continued exposure to the fast-growing high-performance chip sector. Only $12 billion will be paid in cash. The deal will need the approval of at least four regulators, in the U.S., U.K., EU and China.
3. Better news in Covid-19 vaccine hunt
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) CEO Albert Bourla said at the weekend that the vaccine it’s developing together with Germany’s BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) could be available for distribution in the U.S. by the end of the year. Bourla told CBS there was a “good chance” of the companies being able to send data from the crucial phase 3 trial of their drug to the Food and Drug Administration by the end of October.
Also over the weekend, AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) received approval from U.K. authorities to resume the phase 3 trial of its vaccine, being developed jointly with Oxford University.
However, the CEO of the Serum Initiative of India, the world’s biggest manufacturer of vaccines, warned that there isn’t enough production capacity to inoculate everyone who needs protection until 2024 at the earliest.
4. Stocks set to open higher; Gilead, Amazon seen in focus
U.S. stocks are set to open markedly higher on reassurances from the pharma sector about progress in the hunt for a vaccine to fight the Covid-19 virus.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones Futures contract was up 218 points, or 0.8%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 1.1% and NASDAQ Futures were up 1.4%.
Stocks likely to be in focus this morning include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which was Oracle’s chief rival for the TikTok partnership, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which announced it’s hiring another 100,000 in the U.S. and Canada.
There’ll also be some scrutiny of Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), which is set to pay $21 billion for  Immunomedics  (NASDAQ:IMMU), whose most valuable asset,  an experimental drug to treat breast cancer, still hasn’t got FDA approval. Gilead is paying more than twice the market value for Immunomedics.
5. BP moves up forecast for peak oil demand
Crude oil prices drifted lower amid ongoing concerns about the supply-demand balance falling further out of kilter due to the slow recovery in parts of the global economy.
By 6:30 AM, U.S. crude futures were down 0.8% at $37.05 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 0.7% at $37.55.
The mood was further soured by the publication of BP’s new outlook for the energy industry, which predicted that global oil demand will plateau as early as the mid-2020s before going into long-term decline. Most forecasts at the beginning of the year had put ‘peak oil demand’ no earlier than 2040.
 Ironically, the morning’s data were more supportive of the demand recovery: Japanese and eurozone industrial production data both came in comfortably above expectations for July."
518,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>",Fed Must Alter Habits of a Generation in Higher Inflation Quest,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s new push for higher inflation means crafting new tactics that convince Americans it won’t clamp down on rising prices.
For four decades, the Federal Reserve kept up its guard on inflation, beating it back even when it whispered a threat. Such vigilance won the battle but price pressures have since become too weak, depressing interest rates and making it harder for officials to fight recessions.
To fix the problem, Chair Jerome Powell now says the Fed will let inflation overshoot its 2% target and not tighten rates when unemployment falls.
But the new approach “won’t have any practical impact unless Federal Open Market Committee members consciously avoid talking about inflation risk in the coming years,” said Jason Thomas, head of global research at The  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) in Washington. “Until inflation is sustainably above target, the Fed needs to project perfect calm about price developments.”
Powell can expect questions on how the Fed will go about delivering higher inflation at his press conference at 2:30 p.m. Washington time Wednesday, 30 minutes after officials release a policy statement at the conclusion of the rate-setting FOMC’s two-day meeting.
Preemptive Action
Unlearning the habits of a generation of central bankers is a big cultural shift and could take a long time to refine. Ever since its then-chief Paul Volcker defeated inflation in the 1980s, his successors have generally hiked rates and publicly sounded the alarm as price pressures built.
Businesses and households took note, effectively defining the central bank’s inflation goal as slightly below 2%, researchers find.
Now the Fed has committed to achieving 2% inflation on average -- by overshooting the goal if that’s what it takes -- and, importantly, it has the consensus of all 17 policy makers that this is the right thing to do. Despite the historic shift, announced Aug. 27 at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole policy conference, they have left a lot of work undone, including a description of how they will use their limited tools to get there.
“Changing people’s mindsets about what monetary regime you are under, what levels of inflation will be tolerated and will occur, is a long process,” said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “There is nothing in the strategy so far that generates inflation unless you believe that the statement of the strategy alone is credible and somehow immaculately moves prices and wages without any action.”
Raising inflation will be especially hard amid the steep recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which has sent unemployment soaring in the U.S. and depressed price pressures across advanced economies.
Communicating about the need for higher inflation is also complicated by many Americans viewing it as a bad thing. That’s what Fed officials heard during a nationwide listening tour last year as part of their strategy review: higher prices hurt low-income families unless matched by increased wages.
Work in Progress
In terms of tweaks to strategy, Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said on Aug. 31 there are three things that need further work: How they talk about changes to their policy rate in the future, or forward guidance; how they talk about their balance sheet and bond buying; and how they refine their quarterly forecasts, a task he said would likely be done by the end of the year.
Minutes from the July meeting showed officials discussed tying their interest-rate guidance in the FOMC statement to reaching their goals for inflation, unemployment, or both, and possibly rephrasing their justification of asset purchases in terms of stimulating the economy rather than “to sustain smooth market functioning.” That’s the current explanation, and a change would probably extend the expected time frame for purchases.
But curiously, there seems to be no hurry. John Williams, the New York Fed president, said the central bank needs a reliable forecast before it changes its rate outlook.
Forward Guidance
A Bloomberg survey of economists conducted Sept. 4-10 showed most respondents expect the Fed to clarify its guidance in coming months by signaling that future rate hikes will be linked to reaching 2% inflation on average. But just 35% said they expected such new guidance would be unveiled this week.
Economists put a lot of weight on beliefs, or “credible commitments” by the central bank. Because this is a new commitment, it is going to be hard to just move those expectations with words alone, said William English, a former director of the Fed’s Division of Monetary Affairs.
“In terms of making this change credible and built into expectations of markets and the public, it’s going to take time,” said English, who is now a professor at the Yale School of Management. “It may take a couple business cycles before they have really credibly shown this is what they’re going to do. That’s going to be a project.”

519,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>",Sovereigns raid rainy day funds for $100 billion after COVID-19 storm,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Countries coping with the coronavirus crisis and a slump in commodities prices are dipping into sovereign wealth funds for more than $100 billion, and that figure could swell as budget pressures mount for some emerging markets. 
Governments from Angola to East Timor have built up ""rainy day"" savings to help stabilise their economies and support their citizens in the event of a shock. Some funds -- especially derived from commodities wealth -- are worth multiples of national economic output.
The twin blow of the commodities collapse and the pandemic, which stalled much economic activity for months, is likely to drain stabilisation funds in countries like Peru and Colombia, according to Global SWF, which tracks such funds.
Big chunks of similar funds in Ghana and Nigeria are likely to be spent, it said, while 24 withdrawals totalling about $137 billion include heavy drawdowns of savings or development funds in Bahrain, Kuwait, Iran and Angola.
That is still fairly small compared to the roughly $9 trillion in total assets managed across all funds. Some governments have opted to slash spending rather than dip into their sovereign funds and others are unable to because of regulations.
But the scale of the crisis means there is likely to be pressure for more withdrawals, even as questions arise about how and when such funds might be replenished. 
(Graphic: Sovereign wealth fund planned withdrawals, https://graphics.reuters.com/SWF-ASSETS/xlbpglewgvq/chart.png) 
""Some countries are running out of fiscal space, mainly the oil- and mineral-rich emerging markets and low-income countries,"" said Andrew Bauer, a consultant to the independent, non-profit Natural Resource Governance Institute. 
""Mongolia is running out of fiscal space, Ghana is running out of fiscal space, so in countries like these there's really nothing more they can draw down on.""
Mongolia has an external financing gap of $840 million this year, Citi said in a recent research note, while Ghana expects a fiscal deficit of 11.4% of GDP.
With some sovereign funds earning only low single-digit returns on their own investments, it could make more sense for governments which face high borrowing costs to rely on these savings rather than raise debt, said Bauer. 
Higher-rated governments like Qatar, which sold $10 billion in bonds at the peak of the pandemic in April, have less need to tap into their SWFs -- worth $300 billion, in its case.
The finances of Norway and Singapore are secure despite plans to withdraw around $73 billion in total from two of their funds -- single-digit percentages of their total assets.
""A number of sovereign funds entered the year with a buffer, in view of what was then seen as equity markets looking expensive, so have had liquid resources to meet immediate calls for funding from their respective governments,"" said Rod Ringrow, head of official institutions at asset manager Invesco.
Russia has indicated it could draw down as much as one-third of its $130 billion National Welfare Fund this year, while Kazakhstan, another big oil exporter, has liquidated $1.1 billion in assets from its $60 billion fund.
Other funds such as Brunei Investment Agency, the Investment Corporation of Dubai and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority do not publish withdrawals data.
ESCAPE CLAUSES
Some countries have very little left in their sovereign funds, having already lent on them heavily, said Bauer, citing Algeria, Nigeria and Venezuela.
And even with public finances strained, not all governments are drawing down.
Kuwait, which last week cut $3 billion from its budget, has held off tapping its $530 billion Future Generations Fund because of legal restrictions.
Withdrawals have meanwhile been restricted to the stabilisation portion of some funds, said Global SWF managing director Diego López, such as the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority, whose savings and infrastructure funds are still receiving payments. Ghana has used money from its Petroleum Fund but left its Heritage Fund intact, he noted. 
Ghana and Nigeria could withdraw more by using ""escape clauses"" to maintain spending or curb debt accumulation, said Bauer, or by tweaking the funds' rules.
One pressing question is how funds will be replenished, especially if current demands on them persist. 
Legislative changes could be required in some countries if budgeted flows to sovereign funds slow or decline beyond the short term, said Ringrow.
""Now the game has changed for all, but it's too early to gauge if it is transitory or a longer lasting shift in emphasis for the funds,"" said Ringrow.
Danae Kyriakopoulou, chief economist at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a think-tank, said current and future use depended largely on how countries view their sovereign funds, few of which have much history. 
""On the one hand, they're future generation funds, so they're being saved for the future to maintain that wealth,"" she said. 

""But on the other hand, they're rainy day funds -- and if you don't use them now, when you have a storm, when are you going to use them?""

""Due to ongoing technical problems in CREST settlement, the Bank announces that it will not hold gilt purchase operations today,"" the BoE said.
Shortly afterwards, Euroclear said the problems had been resolved. [nL8N2GB1Q9]
CREST is the central securities depository for share and UK government bond markets in the United Kingdom and for Irish stocks, settling trades as the final leg of a transaction.
The BoE had been due to hold a regular 1.5 billion-pound buy-back of British government bonds on Monday as part of its programme to help the economy cope with the coronavirus shock.
CREST first went down on Friday after suffering technical issues, requiring the BoE to switch to back-up procedures to ensure settlement of transactions.
Owner Euroclear said on Sunday it would reopen early on Monday in time for the reopening of financial markets.
Euroclear said on Monday it had identified the cause of the new outage which was not related to Friday's one.
On Saturday, Euroclear said it had no reason to suspect a cyber attack.
A spokeswoman for the BoE said the central bank had decided ""as a precaution"" to delay Monday's short-maturity gilt purchase operation until Thursday. Gilt purchase operations due to take place on Tuesday and Wednesday were unaffected.

There was no impact on consumer payments, the BoE said.

521,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>",Trump and Biden Clash on Best Route to Recovery for U.S. Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- America’s presidential election is entering its closing stretch with the economy still stuck in a pandemic slump, and the candidates locked in a tight battle over the best way to pull it out.The economy looked like a winner for President Donald Trump through most of his first term, with strong growth and unemployment declining. During the first months of the coronavirus recession, he maintained a polling lead on the issue. But lately there are signs that Democratic challenger Joe Biden is catching up.
Some of the policy gaps between the candidates are age-old: The Republican says he’ll cut taxes and red tape, while the Democrat promises to spend more. Others reflect contrasting approaches to new challenges like climate change and competition with China. And on a handful of issues, they broadly agree.There’s also been a big difference in presentation, with a slew of detailed policy proposals emerging from the Biden campaign, while Trump prefers to list promises in terse bullet-points.Whoever wins has a better-than-usual chance of actually implementing their proposals, because the pandemic has blown away old budget restraints, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “There’s a real good chance that a lot of them may become law.”
Here’s how the two candidates’ economic ideas stack up in some key areas.
Pandemic Recovery
The pandemic upended the nation’s longest economic expansion on record. In March and April alone, employers shed more than 22 million people from payrolls. The U.S. has recovered millions of jobs, but remains about 11.5 million short of pre-pandemic levels.
Trump has promised to create 10 million new jobs in 10 months, though both details and the precise time frame are fuzzy.
Meeting Trump’s goal may prove challenging. Permanent business closures have likely eliminated at least 5.5 million jobs, said Aneta Markowska, chief U.S. financial economist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
“Rebuilding those jobs is going to require new business formations or significant expansion by existing businesses, and that is just a process that takes time,” Markowska said.
Biden has promised to grow U.S. employment beyond pre-pandemic levels with a series of new government programs he calls “Build Back Better.” They include $400 billion for manufacturing and $300 billion for research and development, which Biden says could create 5 million jobs on top of those lost to the coronavirus outbreak.
He has not attached a timeframe to his plan, though he would face pressure to achieve it by the end of his first term.
Tax and Spend
Fiscal policy may be the sharpest distinction between the candidates’ economic platforms. Trump has said he wants to build on tax cuts passed in his first term, while Biden has pledged to at least partly reverse them.The president says he’ll make the 2017 reductions to income and corporate taxes permanent (they’re currently due to expire in 2025), and his team has hinted at a “Tax Cuts 2.0” without giving much detail. Economic adviser Larry Kudlow has suggested there could be a reduction for the “middle class,” achieved by lowering the 22% marginal rate of income tax to 15%.
Trump deferred payroll taxes by executive order during the pandemic and says he’ll get Congress to turn that into a permanent write-off if re-elected.
Biden says he’ll undo half of Trump’s corporate tax cut by lifting the rate to 28% from 21%. He’s also told the wealthiest Americans that they should expect to pay more. Tax rates on income above $400,000 would edge up to 39.6% from 37%.
The former vice president would also eliminate tax breaks for capital gains and dividends, and he plans to charge payroll taxes on incomes above $400,000 (they currently only apply below $137,700).On the outlays side of the budget, Trump -- who funneled more cash to the Pentagon during his first term -- has hinted he might look to slash spending in a second term, but has also promised to increase federal funding for law enforcement and infrastructure.
Biden’s promises include $2 trillion for a clean-energy overhaul and about $1.5 trillion split between support for care for children and the elderly and for manufacturing.
‘Made in America’
The coronavirus recession hit service industries especially hard -– and highlighted the U.S. economy’s growing dependence on them, after the disappearance of manufacturing jobs since the 1990s. Both candidates have plans to bring the factories back – and both feature “Made in America” tax credits to encourage domestic investment.Trump’s team has floated the idea of halving the corporate rate to 10.5% for firms that relocate to the U.S. The president is also proposing measures specifically tailored to companies repatriating jobs from China, as well as a 100% expensing deduction in crucial industries like pharmaceuticals and robotics.
Biden would offer a 10% tax credit for companies that reopen or renovate idled factories, or retool them to make priority goods like electric cars. The measure would also apply in industries where the U.S. competes with government-subsidized Chinese manufacturers, and would help cover relocation costs for companies that bring operations home.
Offshore Stick
In addition to carrots, both candidates plan to use sticks to reverse the outsourcing of production by U.S. companies to lower-wage countries like China, Vietnam and Mexico.
Trump has said he would prohibit federal contracts for companies that outsource to China, and impose tariffs on those that “desert America.”
Biden plans to impose a surcharge on profits made by U.S. firms that manufacture products overseas and sell them at home: they would pay a corporate tax rate of 30.8%. He’d also phase out deductions and expensing write-offs for businesses that move overseas, and impose a 21% minimum tax on all foreign earnings.
Energy Jobs
Both Trump and Biden have identified the energy industry as a key sector for job creation. But their approaches couldn’t be more different.
Trump has said he will “continue to unleash American energy” by cutting more regulations – a follow-up to first-term policies that included approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and expansion of natural-gas export approval. He’s tried to paint Biden as an extreme environmentalist who would destroy energy-sector and automaking jobs.
Biden says his plan for $2 trillion in clean-energy projects would create at least 10 million jobs –- including some in the auto industry, driven by a shift to electric cars. He’d also set up a “civilian climate corps” modeled on work-relief programs during the Great Depression.
The Democratic contender acknowledges that some existing energy jobs, such as those at coal mines and power plants that rely on the fossil fuel, would disappear -– and he’s pledged training and other support for the displaced workers.

523,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 04:20AM ET</span>",Indian government to infuse $2.72 billion in state-run banks,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's government sought parliamentary approval to inject 200 billion rupees ($2.72 billion) in state-run banks in the current fiscal year, to help lenders mitigate the expected surge in bad loans due to the pandemic.
In April, Reuters reported that New Delhi had assured state banks that it is ready to provide capital support as the coronavirus pandemic may lead to a surge in bad loans as economic growth slows.
The pandemic's impact is likely to push up the ratio of gross non-performing assets in the Indian banking system to at least 12.5% by March 2021, from 8.5% in March 2020, according to a report by the Reserve Bank of India.
The government has already pumped in 3.5 trillion rupees in the last five years to rescue its banks.
In February's budget it had not allocated any funds to support the sector and instead encouraged them to turn to India's capital markets.
The government sought parliament approval for a total additional spending of 1.67 trillion rupees ($22.8 billion) for the current fiscal year.

The government would use the 466.02 billion rupees to transfer to states whose are finding it difficult to raise taxes and 100 billion rupees to subsidize food.

524,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 04:11AM ET</span>","Still closed, Irish pubs show shortcomings of slow lockdown exit","By Padraic Halpin
DONARD, Ireland (Reuters) - Ireland's plan to reopen its economy at a slower pace than most was supposed to ensure a more sustainable rebound from the COVID-19 crisis. Tell that to pub owner Paul Moynihan.
Eagerly awaiting a promised July 20 reopening of non-food pubs, he spent 10,000 euros ($11,855) on a beer garden at his establishment in the village of Donard hoping some late summer trade would help compensate the sudden March closure.
But the government moved the date three times and those pubs are now only due to open their doors on Sept. 21 - even though infection rates are 10 times more than late July. 
""It's ironic: they kept us closed to make sure the numbers didn't rise and they rose hugely with us closed,"" said Moynihan, surrounded by empty stools at his bar in the small County Wicklow locality, 50 km (31 miles) from Dublin. 
""I don't know what the logic was, it didn't work anyway.""
The antithesis to Sweden's hands off approach, Ireland's strict controls on labour-intensive sectors did keep coronavirus cases among the lowest in Europe. But a recent spike has seen the 14-day rate of cumulative cases per 100,000 people jump to almost 40 from three to four in late July. 
As the only country in Europe with most pubs still shut - together with most live venues and all nightclubs - the ultra-cautious lockdown exit is bringing uneven recovery in the European Union's best-performing economy for most of the last five years.
Unemployment, including those considered temporarily laid off, stands at 15.4%, while the government is subsidising the wages of a further 15% of the workforce.
However, Ireland's large multinational sector has protected it, with data this week showing a far shallower recession than most in the second quarter, setting the economy on an uneven ""K-shaped"" trajectory, with some high-value export sectors thriving while domestic-facing consumer sectors suffer.
While Irish gross domestic product fell by just 3% year-on-year, the least bad in the EU, a 23% collapse in consumption was the second largest behind Spain.
""Ireland's exports are set up sectorally pretty well for COVID. We do a lot of pharmaceuticals, a lot of medical devices and a lot of tech services, particularly cloud computing. That means we're doing okay actually as a whole,"" said Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC) chief economist Gerard Brady (NYSE:BRC).
""But if you look at any of the key metrics during lockdown, Ireland is towards the worst affected countries on almost all of them. The most employment-intensive sectors have suffered the worst.""
PATCHY RECOVERY 
Ireland's hospitality, retail, administrative and transport sectors account for half of the 220,000 people still temporarily laid off. By comparison, multinationals employed 245,000 or one-in-ten workers at the end of 2019.
Low activity in job-rich sectors, exacerbated by severe travel restrictions that halted virtually all inbound tourism, risks scarring effects such as long-term unemployment.
The patchiness of the recovery is widely evident. 
DIY store owner Grafton (L:GFTU_u) felt obliged to repay the government for lockdown wage supports after consumers who had built up a record level of savings flocked to its outlets upon their May reopening. 
Carrier Ryanair (I:RYA), on the other hand, is suing the state over travel curbs and has warned its Irish workers will be worst hit by job cuts. Building materials group Kingspan (I:KSP) saw Irish revenues fall by 90% at the height of lockdown, three times the average rate across all 70 countries it operates in. 
""In one of our businesses, we didn't raise an invoice for two months, which is quite staggering for a large industrial business,"" Kingspan Chief Executive Gene Murtagh told Reuters.
""Whether or not the country got the health dividend commensurate with those actions, I'd say is questionable.""
While escaping the kind of excess deaths suffered in Sweden, Spain and Britain, Ireland has had a broadly similar fatality rate to other EU economies that opened much faster, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Relatively low hospital bed capacity explains the caution.
In Donard, home to farm workers and Dublin commuters but without a cafe, restaurant or public transport link, Moynihan is just glad he may see his regulars again. 
""There are people in rural Ireland who won't see anybody really without the pub,"" said Moynihan, who as president-elect of the Vintners' Federation of Ireland pushed the government for a firm opening date. 
""It feels like there's light at the end of the tunnel.""

527,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 13, 2020 08:45PM ET</span>","China Clamps Down on Finance Arms of Ant, Other Giants","(Bloomberg) -- China is tightening rules and imposing capital demands on sprawling empires such as Ant Group and China Evergrande Group in its latest attempt to curb risks in the nation’s $49 trillion financial industry.
The new regulations will require licenses for non-financial companies that do business across at least two financial sectors, and which are designated as “financial holding companies,” the State Council said Sunday on its website. Any application must be submitted within 12 months after the rules take effect on Nov. 1.
Companies with a banking operation and financial assets of more than 500 billion yuan ($73.1 billion), or those with financial assets exceeding 100 billion yuan must seek a license. Those that are denied a license must sell their stakes in the financial companies or give up control, according to the rules.
Chinese authorities are plugging regulatory loopholes and stepping up their bid to maintain stability as the Covid-19 pandemic pummels economic growth and bad loans pile up. In 2018, the central bank identified Evergrande, HNA Group Co., Fosun International Ltd., Tomorrow Group as well as billionaire Jack Ma’s Ant as financial holding companies, putting them under increased scrutiny because of their growing role in the nation’s money flows and financial plumbing.
The move will “prevent spillover of risks and promote healthy circulation between the economy and the financial industry by imposing complete, sustainable and thorough regulation on capital, behavior and risks,” the People’s Bank of China said in a separate statement.
Companies covered under the regulation will need at least 5 billion yuan in actual paid registered capital, which should account for at least 50% of the combined registered capital of their controlled financial entities, according to the rules.
Loan Leader
Ant has emerged as a consumer loan leader in recent years with the help of an array of banks. The firm also operates payments systems, owns a stake in an online bank, and runs insurance and wealth management units.
In anticipation of tighter rules, Ant plans to apply for a financial holding license through its Zhejiang Finance Credit Network Technology Co. unit, according to the prospectus for its initial public offering released last month. Ant is considering putting certain financial entities into the arm to help reduce the potential capital needed under the proposed rules, people familiar with the matter said last year.
In its 2018 financial stability report, the central bank warned that the work of regulating was becoming increasingly complex, with firms rapidly expanding in the financial sector through cross border alliances and intricate corporate structures, tied together by connected transactions and investments in existing financial institutions.
At the end of 2016, about 70 central government-owned enterprises had a total of over 150 financial subsidiaries. Another 28 private firms each had stakes in at least five financial units.
HNA, the indebted airline-turned-global takeover hunter, has sold off tens of billions of dollars in assets since 2018, including stakes in  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (NYSE:HLT) Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB). Earlier this year, Chinese authorities announced the government would take control of the group, likely paving the way for speedy asset disposals to help repay about $75 billion of debt.
Evergrande, a real estate developer controlled by billionaire Hui Ka Yan, spent heavily on other financial assets before slowing down in 2018. It owns Shengjing Bank Co., a lender in China’s northeast province of Liaoning, as well as a mid-sized insurance company.
Another conglomerate that could be subject to the new regulations is Fosun, controlled by billionaire Guo Guangchang. Its operations span insurance, banking, retail, tourism and pharmaceuticals. Fosun has also spent billions acquiring assets including French fashion brands, Portugal’s largest insurer and European soccer clubs.
The new rules will blacklist certain individuals from becoming major or controlling shareholders in financial holding firms, such as people who falsified capital injections or undertook illegal activities at financial entities. Such firms must have simplified and transparent ownership structure compatible with its scale and risk management capabilities, according to the PBOC.
Beijing in July seized control of nine financial firms that are linked to Tomorrow Group, the investment conglomerate owned by financier Xiao Jianhua. Xiao taken from a hotel in Hong Kong by Chinese authorities in 2017 and hasn’t been seen in public since.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina is seeking to avoid repayments to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the period 2021-2024 as it negotiates a new deal with the lender, Economy Minister Martin Guzman told local newspaper La Nacion in a report published on Sunday.
The country, which is heading into its third year of recession, last month initiated talks with the fund over a deal to replace a failed 2018 agreement that has already seen around $44 billion disbursed. 
""The objective is very clear: first, we do not want to face payments with the Fund in the period 2021-2024,"" said Guzman, who this month sealed restructurings of over $100 billion of Argentina's foreign currency debt with private creditors.
""We have to have a clear horizon in terms of financial burden in the coming years and we are going towards that point. That will require negotiations that will take a while.""
Argentina currently faces the bulk of its repayments on its current stand-by arrangement with the IMF in 2022-2023, when almost $40 billion needs to be stumped up. The Fund has said it wants to work constructively with the country.
President Alberto Fernandez's center-left government will send its 2021 budget bill to Congress next week, with a forecast primary fiscal deficit of 4.5% of GDP, which will be financed in part with transfers from the central bank.
""We hope that financing from the central bank will decrease, although it will not be possible to do without it completely for a while,"" Guzman said.

""That is why we are seeking to normalize public finances, gradually reduce financing needs from the central bank, and gradually lower inflation, which is a key objective.""

With debt levels blowing past 100% of GDP this year, concerns are rising that politicians will struggle to push through more support and some subsidies, raising the risk that employment and income schemes could abruptly end.
""Confidence in the private sector rests to a very large extent on confidence in fiscal policies,"" Lagarde said in a speech. ""Continued expansionary fiscal policies are vital to avoid excessive job shedding and support household incomes until the economic recovery is more robust.""
Employment subsidy schemes have already been extended in several countries but some are advocating longer, one- or two-year extensions to bolster confidence while the bloc recovers from recession that could slash 8% from output this year.
""Keeping job support schemes in place is critical to avoid a sharp increase in unemployment later in the year,"" she added in a speech to the Annual Meeting of the Council of Governors of the Arab Central Banks and Monetary Authorities.
Lagarde also urged a final deal on the European Union's 750 billion euro recovery fund, which is still under negotiation and subject to political bickering.
For its part, the ECB is ready to adjust all of its instruments as needed since there is no place for complacency, Lagarde said, largely repeating the bank's standing message. 
The ECB has eased policy several times this year and now estimates that its measures will add 1.3 percentage points to growth and 0.8 percentage point to inflation through 2022.

Lagarde also repeated her comments from Thursday that the ECB would ""carefully"" assess incoming data, including the euro's strengthening, which risked dampening both growth and inflation.

531,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>",Japan's Suga says no limit to bonds government can issue,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, who is set to become prime minister this week, said on Sunday there was no limit to the amount of bonds the government can issue to support an economy hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
He also indicated he could look to a third extra budget to fight the downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic if needed, adding the government had enough resources to tap at present.
""Only when we have economic growth can we push through fiscal reform. What's most important is to create jobs and protect businesses,"" Suga said on a television programme.
""I don't think so,"" he said, when asked if there was a limit to bond issuance. ""What's important now is to improve current (economic) conditions,"" he added.
Suga made the remarks on a programme where he appeared alongside his two rivals in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) leadership election, to be held on Monday.
Speculation is mounting that Suga, who has seen his popularity rise in opinion polls since announcing his bid for the top job, may call a general election as early as next month to improve his chances of winning a full three-year term as LDP leader in a party election that must be held in September 2021.
Finance Minister Taro Aso told supporters in eastern Japan on Sunday that Suga's cabinet may be criticised for not having a popular mandate and that in that case, ""imminent"" snap elections could be possible, the Nikkei daily said. 
LDP junior coalition partner Komeito has spoken against snap elections anytime soon. Suga has been vague on the subject.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said last month he would resign due to ill health. The winner of the party vote is virtually assured to become prime minister because of the LDP's parliamentary majority.
Suga also told a separate programme on Sunday that he could consider another stimulus budget if necessary.

""Japan's GDP suffered its biggest postwar contraction in the second quarter, so we need to do whatever it takes to support growth. We have reserves set aside, so we can of course tap that. But if additional steps are necessary, we would act,"" he said.

Gross domestic product shrunk by a record 51% in the second quarter, its fourth quarterly contraction in a row, as a strict lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus saw activity grind to a near-standstill.
""The contraction in growth is larger than anticipated by the National Treasury and the SA Reserve Bank, which raises the risk that the actual GDP outcome for this year could be lower than previously thought by both policymakers and the broader market,"" Mboweni wrote in the piece published in the City Press weekly newspaper.
In July the Reserve Bank cut its 2020 forecast for GDP to a 7.3% contraction. In its emergency budget in June, the Treasury pencilled in a 7% decline, but some analysts see a double-digit contraction. 
In his article Mboweni, brought back to cabinet by President Cyril Ramaphosa in 2018 after more than a decade in the private sector, said his office would speed up reforms, by easing regulatory hurdles and allowing more private investment in the public sector, especially in electricity.
State utility Eskom, which provides around 90% of the country's power, has struggled for years to meet demand, unleashing nationwide blackouts to keep the grid from collapsing. 
With debt of around 500 billion rand ($30 billion) and heavily reliant on bailouts from government, Eskom has regularly been cited as the main threat to the economy and fiscal stability. 
The government has long been criticised for its slowness in dealing with Eskom. In the article, Mboweni said the government would move with greater speed via ""Operation Vulindlela"" (open the way), a joint initiative between the Treasury and the presidency announced in his budget speech in June and aimed at accelerating structural reform. He did not give details of the plan.

""It is not another new plan. It involves implementing existing commitments through mechanisms to escalate challenges and fast-track implementation,"" Mboweni wrote.

Investing.com - The Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday for the final time before the Nov. 3 presidential election with investors hoping to learn more about its decision to tolerate higher inflation. Markets will also be paying close attention to data on U.S. retail sales for August, out on Wednesday and initial jobless claims figures a day later. Last week’s volatility in stocks could continue with a much-awaited fiscal aid package stalled in the Senate and the election looming. In the UK, the government is to begin debating its controversial internal markets bill which could wreck its EU divorce treaty. Meanwhile, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan will both hold policy meetings just hours after the Fed on Thursday. Here is what you need to know to start your week.
The Fed, which wraps up its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, is expected to make some minor adjustments to the language in its rate statement after it adopted a new approach last month to meeting its 2% inflation target. The Fed’s decision to tolerate periods of higher inflation effectively means that interest rates will remain lower for longer.
The Fed will also update its projections for the economic and interest rate outlook, known as the dot plot, which will include forecasts for 2023 for the first time.
""I think the 2023 dots will be the ones everybody’s staring at,” said Jon Hill, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that while the central bank will keep its foot on the monetary policy gas, lawmakers also need to help with recovery relief, making the absence of a new fiscal policy package an increasingly worrying development for some investors.
Ahead of the Fed announcement on Wednesday the U.S. is to release data on retail sales for August. The consensus forecast is for an increase of 1% month-over-month and the data will give an important insight into whether the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits at the end of July hit consumer spending. 
Market participants will also be watching Thursday’s data on initial jobless claims. The number of new claims for unemployment benefits hovered at elevated levels last week, suggesting the labor market recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was stalling as government financial aid to businesses and the unemployed dries up.
Some investors are worried that last week’s stock market volatility - which knocked the Nasdaq down as much as 10% from its highs and rocked other indexes - is the start of a larger sell-off that will throw the market off its course after a six-month rally.
But other investors view the recent slump as a healthy consolidation after a stunning five-month rally in the S&P 500 that was powered by a small group of heavyweight tech companies and massive amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus.
Analysts at Bank of America Global Research have noted that September tends to be the weakest month of the year, with stocks notching gains less than half the time and the S&P 500’s average return at minus 1%.
The bank’s data also shows that markets tend to dip in the weeks ahead of an election, then rallying after.
The British government is to begin debating the internal market bill on Monday and while Prime Minister Boris Johnson has an 80-seat majority, internal discontent over the bill could test his leadership.
The move to table a bill that would breach the existing withdrawal agreement, which London openly admits would contravene international law, could sink the chances of a post-Brexit trade agreement, and trigger legal action by the European Union.
Analysts at Morgan Stanley have increased the likelihood of Britain and the EU ending up trading on World Trade Organization terms to 40% from 25%.
""The risks are skewed to a harder outcome... bumping up the probability of our bear case of a WTO-style outcome to 40%. We still expect a delay in implementing the deal,"" the bank’s analysts said, in a note.
Sterling has already lost 4% this month and at $1.28, the full risk may still not be priced in.
The Fed shift to tolerate higher inflation, effectively a pledge to keep policy loose, puts other central banks in tough spot. Unless they follow suit, the effects of the weaker dollar against their currencies could threaten their economic recovery and their inflation outlooks.
Last week the European Central Bank said the stronger euro is not yet a concern. But it, along with its peers in the UK and Japan, which meet this week, could eventually be forced down the Fed's looser-for-longer route.
No policy changes are expected from the Bank of Japan or the Bank of England. But the BoE may flag extending its bond-buying to help an economy battered by the effects of the pandemic and Brexit.
The BoJ meanwhile must contend with an incoming new prime minister, likely Yoshihide Suga, who recently called for the bank to work with the government, saying he didn't buy arguments about negative rates hitting bank profits.

534,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2020 03:35AM ET</span>",Continuity and reforms: Key policies of Japan PM hopeful Suga,"By Kiyoshi Takenaka
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga looks set to become prime minister this week, after garnering the backing of 
most of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) factions to win a party leadership election slated for Monday.
Incumbent premier Shinzo Abe announced last month he was resigning because of poor health. The winner of the party election is virtually assured of becoming prime minister because of the LDP's parliamentary majority.
Here is where Suga stands on key policies. 
ECONOMY 
A longtime lieutenant of Abe, Suga aims to continue the incumbent's hyper-easy monetary policy, stepped-up government spending and structural reforms, dubbed ""Abenomics"". 
Suga also plans to maintain Abe's policy of prioritising economic growth over efforts to fix the country's tattered finances. 
He said on Sunday there was no limit to the amount of bonds the government can issue to support an economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic, and indicated he could look to a third extra budget to fight the economic downturn.
""Only when we have economic growth can we push through fiscal reform,"" Suga said. 
Suga has voiced his readiness to have the central bank take additional easing steps to protect jobs. 
He opposes lowering the 10% sales tax rate. Some lawmakers have proposed cutting the tax to reduce the burden of the pandemic on households.
A son of a farmer from northern Japan, Suga counts the revitalisation of the regional economy as one of his key priorities. 
REFORMS 
As a strong proponent of reforms, Suga favours greater consolidation of regional banks and has also reiterated his intention to ask mobile phone carriers to lower fees, which he has advocated during Abe's tenure.
He aims to form an agency to promote the government's digital strategies under one roof and said in a recent newspaper interview that he will look into a possible overhaul of the health ministry. 
""On becoming the LDP president, I would break down the vertically segmented administrative system, get rid of vested interests ... and do my best to push ahead with regulatory reforms,"" Suga said last week. 
He urges companies to set hiring targets to help women's advancement in society, and proposes insurance coverage for fertility treatments. 
Suga said on Sunday he would like to appoint reform-minded lawmakers to cabinet posts if he were to become prime minister. 
DIPLOMACY, SECURITY 
Suga regards Japan's alliance with the United States as the mainstay of Tokyo's diplomacy and security, and seeks stable ties with neighbouring countries including China. 
Suga has said he is willing to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un with no preconditions to resolve the issue of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea decades ago.
He is for revising the U.S.-drafted pacifist constitution, a much cherished goal of Abe that ultimately eluded the outgoing prime minister. 
Asked about his position on Japan possibly acquiring the capability to strike enemy targets last week, he said he would first observe ruling party debate, without specifying where he stands on the issue. 
Suga on Saturday defended his experience in diplomacy, an area where experts say his resume is rather thin, by saying he has been involved in all the major foreign policy decisions under Abe. 
CORONAVIRUS AND BEYOND
Suga aims to boost coronavirus testing capacity and secure enough vaccine for Japan's entire population by the middle of next year. 
He is a strong promoter of tourism as a way to drive local economies and signalled in a recent interview with Reuters the importance of re-opening the economy and also ensuring that the pandemic is contained.
In the interview he also stressed that Japan would do ""whatever it takes"" to ensure it could host the Olympics next year. The event was originally planned for this summer but postponed for a year due to the pandemic. 

He has said preventing the spread of the coronavirus will take priority in any decision on holding a snap election.

WASHINGTON/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's nominee on Saturday won election as president of the Inter-American Development Bank, the region's main economic development lender, making him the first U.S. citizen to lead the institution in its 61-year history.
Mauricio Claver-Carone, Trump's senior Latin America adviser, told the bank's governors before voting began that he would be ""a passionate advocate"" for the bank, its staff and the region. He will take office on Oct. 1 and has pledged to serve only one five-year term.
Trump's decision to nominate a U.S. candidate to head the bank broke with a tradition for the president to come from the region and sparked criticism from some Latin American countries, development groups and the European Union.
But Claver-Carone won the backing of a majority of countries in the region. 
Thirty of the Bank's 48 governors voted for Claver-Carone, including 23 from the region, amounting to 66.8% of the vote, a spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council said. Three sources familiar with the vote said 16 countries abstained. 
Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Costa Rica - concerned about the precedent of the move - initially sought to delay the vote but failed to win sufficient backing to do so.
The IDB vote turned into a geopolitical battle between the Trump administration, which is keen to gain leverage in resource-rich Latin America and counter the rise of China, and some in the region who wanted to retain control of the top job.
Some countries also were concerned about electing Claver-Carone, a Trump loyalist, should Trump lose the Nov. 3 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden, whose campaign also criticized the nomination of the Cuba hawk.
Argentina's foreign ministry thanked Chile, Mexico, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago and European Union countries for backing its decision to abstain from the vote, noting that the abstentions accounted for just over 31% of the votes cast.
Chile reiterated discontent over the timing of the election, saying in a statement that a delay could have brought forward other candidates ""who might have been able to convene, encourage dialogue and build consensus."" 
Costa Rica said it decided to vote in favor of Claver-Carone after he committed to some proposals by former Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla, whom the country had planned to nominate for the job. Chinchilla dropped her bid to lead the IDB earlier in the month.
Carone said he would work with member countries to ""strengthen the bank, respond to the needs of the region and create opportunities for shared prosperity and economic growth.""
Claver-Carone is a key architect of the U.S. ""America Rising"" program, or ""America Crece"" aimed at accelerating private investment in the region. The Trump administration is also pushing U.S. companies to relocate manufacturing facilities from China to the Western Hemisphere.
The IDB has been led by Latin Americans, with an American in the No. 2 job, since the institution's inception in 1959. Critics say electing Claver-Carone to head the bank and his pledge to appoint a Latin American as executive vice president sets a precedent that could harm Washington in the end by loosening its hold on the bank's No. 2 post. 
Senator Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the vote raised questions about Latin Americans ""charting their own future"" and signaled it could have consequences for U.S. funding of the institution.

""...We need to review whether this is the best use of resources to assist the people of those countries,” Leahy said in a statement to Reuters.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on Saturday announced a tax relief package to boost jobs amidst a downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic, as well as rise in spending to strengthen the country's defence capabilities.
At his annual economic address in the northern city of Thessaloniki, Mitsotakis said his conservative government will end real estate tax in 26 islands and lower social security charges for workers and employers.
""Our priority cannot be other than safeguarding employment,"" he said.
Greece's economic recovery has ground to a halt after the outbreak of COVID-19 and measures to combat the pandemic. It slumped at an annual 15.2% clip in the second quarter in the face of the coronavirus shock.
Dependent on tourism, the economy has been hard hit by lockdowns and travel restrictions. So far, government support including furlough schemes has contained the rise in unemployment, which climbed to 18.3% in June, the highest in 16 months.
Government support has helped cushion the blow to the economy. Despite tight finances, fiscal targets for this year and next were waived to enable it to inject liquidity in the economy of around 6.3% of GDP.
But the response has turned primary budget surpluses, which exclude debt servicing outlays, to deficits - estimated to reach 5% to 6% of GDP this year.
Mitsotakis said all unemployment benefits would be extended by two months and terminate the so-called solidarity tax surcharge on incomes for one year in 2021.
He also said that in October the state would return 1.4 billion euros to pensioners, whose income was slashed during the debt crisis of the past decade.
Amid tensions with neighbouring Turkey over energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean region, Mitsotakis said that Greece will boost its armed forces. 
He announced the purchase of 18 Dassault-made Rafale fighter jets (PA:AVMD), without providing a figure for the sale, and said that Greece will start the process for the acquisition of four frigates and the upgrade of another four frigates, without disclosing further details. 

The country will also purchase new weapons, torpedoes and missiles and revamp its loss-making defence industry. Over the next five years, the armed forces will also hire 15,000 staff, he said.

PHOENIX, Ore. (Reuters) - Matt Manson stared at the burned-out corpse of his pick-up truck on Friday, which sat on a blackened driveway in front of a smoldering pile of rubble that once was his house.
Like other residents of the small agricultural town of Phoenix, Oregon, he was in shock as he returned to his neighborhood and saw how fast the Alameda Drive wildfire had engulfed his home and upended his life. 
""The fire melted the motor right out of my truck - it drained down the driveway,"" said Manson, a 43-year-old construction worker. ""I lost everything. I lost all my tools. My truck. I can't work. I lost $30,000 worth of guitars. All gone."" 
Manson, who now owns only a backpack with a change of clothes, struggled to find the words to describe how the fire had ravaged the town that sits near the green Siskiyou Mountains, about 210 miles south of Portland. Trees lining his street were now just blackened, skeletal remains.
""It looks like a war just happened here,"" he said.
A half million people in Oregon were ordered to evacuate as of Friday as scores of wildfires ate up the parched countryside, smoke darkening skies across the state, along with neighboring California and Washington. At least 24 people have died since the fires began last month. Authorities say they expect to find many more dead when they can inspect hard-hit areas.
In Phoenix the smoke was still thick in the air as many of its 4,600 residents tried to grasp the extent of the damage. Local authorities said the fire destroyed a large swath of the town. State fire officials said at least two people were killed and four injured, and that the fire was 20% contained as of Friday afternoon. 
Doris Peterson, 85, said she only had time to grab Toby, her 12-year-old Chihuahua, when she and her husband, Richard, fled after police banged on their door Tuesday about noon and told them they had just minutes to get out.
They spent five hours in bumper-to-bumper traffic before finding a hotel room in Grants Pass, Oregon - 35 miles up Interstate 5.
On Friday she and her husband sat in their car at a baseball field just north of Phoenix, waiting to be escorted into their neighborhood by police. She was bracing for the worst, but still hoped for a miracle. 

""I called my landline phone - and the answering machine picked up!"" she said. ""My next door neighbor's will not pick up. Maybe our house survived.""

541,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 07:42PM ET</span>",'Everything is gone': wildfires torch hundreds of homes in U.S. West,"By Carlos Barria and Adrees Latif
MOLALLA, Ore./MEDFORD, Ore. (Reuters) - Around half a million people in Oregon were under evacuation alerts on Friday, with residents of its largest city told to be ready to leave, as wildfires that have taken 24 lives since erupting in August tore through three U.S. West Coast states.
About 100 wildfires in the U.S, West have engulfed an area nearly as large as New Jersey, belching out smoke that has given California, Oregon and Washington some of the worst air quality levels anywhere around the globe. 
In hard-hit Oregon, search teams on Friday entered areas where fires burned through small communities, the head of the state's office of emergency management said, adding that authorities were prepared for possible ""mass casualty incidents."" 
Molalla, a community about 25 miles (40 km) south of downtown Portland, was an ash-covered ghost town after its more than 9,000 residents were told to evacuate, with only 30 refusing to leave, the city's fire department said.
The logging town was on the front line of a vast evacuation zone stretching north to within three miles (4.8 km) of downtown Portland, with Clackamas County police setting a 10 p.m. PDT (0500 on Saturday GMT) curfew to deter ""possible increased criminal activity."" 
Oregon Governor Kate Brown told a press conference that 40,000 people were under mandatory evacuation alerts. Some 500,000 residents were under evacuation advisories of either red ""GO!"" warnings to leave homes immediately, yellow ""BE SET"" warnings to leave at a moment's notice, or green ""BE READY"" alerts, she said
A drop in winds, higher moisture levels and forecast rain were expected to help firefighters going into the weekend in towns like Molalla, at the mercy of wind strength and direction after two of Oregon's largest wildfires merged into one. 
""The weather is going to be favorable for us,"" said Doug Grafe, chief of fire protection for the Oregon Department of Forestry.
In southern Oregon, an apocalyptic scene of burned residential subdivisions and trailer parks stretched for miles along Highway 99 south of Medford through Phoenix and Talent, one of the most devastated areas, according to a Reuters photographer at the scene.
A Mexican-American family described evacuating the Bear Creek Mobile Home park five miles south of Medford as flocks of birds flew from advancing flames and sparks began to rain down on their house.
Beatriz Gomez Bolanos, 41, told her children to close their eyes as fires burned on both sides of their car as they made their escape.
""Everything is gone, we have to start again from nothing, but we are alive,"" said Gomez Bolanos. Like her husband, she emigrated 20 years ago from Mexico to the United States where her four children were born.
The death toll from the siege of West Coast fires that began in August jumped to 24 after seven people were reported killed in a fire burning in mountains around 85 miles north of Sacramento, California. Over 3,900 homes and others structures have burned in California alone, state fire authority Cal Fire reported.
Brown said there were dozens of people reported missing after fires in Oregon's Jackson, Marion and Lane counties.
Over 68,000 people were under evacuation orders in California where the largest fire in state history has burned over 740,000 acres (299,470 hectares) in the Mendocino National Forest around 120 miles (190 km) northwest of Sacramento. 
“We had four hours to pack up our pets and a few medications and things like that,” said retiree John Maylone from an evacuation center in Fresno, California, after he was forced to leave three of his 30 cats as he fled the massive Creek Fire. 
Paradise, a town blasted by California's deadliest wildfire in 2018, had the world's worst air quality index reading at 592, according to the PurpleAir monitoring site, as two of the state's largest blazes burned on either side of it.
Police opened an arson investigation into the fire that destroyed much of Phoenix and Talent in Oregon. At least four Oregon police departments warned of ""fake"" online messages appearing to be from law enforcement that blamed left-wing anti-fascists and right-wing Proud Boy activists for starting the fires.
Over 100 years of fire suppression by state and federal authorities has created a huge buildup of dead trees and undergrowth to fuel the fires that have long burned naturally in the West's forests. 
In recent decades Americans have built houses in those forests as second homes or after being pushed out of metropolitan areas like San Francisco, Portland and Seattle by rising prices.

Scientists say climate change has contributed to greater extremes in wet and dry seasons, causing vegetation to flourish then dry out, leaving more abundant, volatile fuel for fires.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bond yields fell on Friday after the U.S. Treasury on Thursday completed $108 billion in supply this week, and as investors remained doubtful that inflation will increase much even as consumer prices rose more than expected in August.
The supply has weighed on the market this week, with the Treasury selling a record amount of three-year notes as well as the largest reopenings of 10-year notes and 30-year bonds in history.
Bond yields also fell after data showed an increase in consumer prices last month.
The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose 0.4% in August, marking its third consecutive monthly increase.
""You have to take (the data) with a grain of salt, because there's a lot of dislocation that's going on because of the virus and the lockdown,"" said Lou Brien, a market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago.
U.S. 10-year yields reflect pessimism that the Federal Reserve will be able to lift inflation to its target, despite fiscal stimulus and ongoing quantitative easing, Brien said.
The yields are ""the dog that didn't bark,"" he said. ""The last three consumer price index numbers were stronger than expected, and I think that it's interesting that in spite of that, the 10-year is still sitting right around 0.67%.""
The 10-year note yields (US10YT=RR) fell two basis points on the day to 0.669%.
The next major focus will be next week’s Fed policy meeting, where the U.S. central bank will update its economic projections. Investors will also be watching for any new details on its new framework that will include allowing inflation to run higher than previously before raising interest rates.

(Reuters) - The U.S. labor market and broader economy made some gains this week, which history shows should be good news for President Donald Trump's re-election campaign. 
But the gains may be overshadowed by the tens of millions of Americans still out of work because of coronavirus-related shutdowns and growing concerns that there is no new government relief package in sight.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, in July soared to 6.6 million, nearly back to their pre-crisis level, a Labor Department report showed this week. 
For a graphic on Big rebound in job openings:
https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ECONOMY/xegvbodwxpq/chart.png
Inflation firmed last month, vanquishing fears of growth-stunting deflation. Higher frequency data tracking people's visits to stores and restaurants also pointed to an economic upswing.
However, the economy is nowhere near to rounding the corner to recovery. At least 29.6 million people were still receiving unemployment benefits as of Aug. 22, a report on Thursday showed, and the number of new applicants for jobless benefits was stuck at a high level, at 884,000.
Deadlock in Washington over a new fiscal relief bill could mean this is as good as things get for the economy for some time.
On Thursday, the Senate failed to pass a Republican bill that would have provided around $300 billion in new coronavirus relief. Democrats are pushing for a $3 trillion bill. 
""Part of the healthy recovery owes to generous fiscal stimulus policies which have started to fade,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) economists said in a note on Friday. ""It has become unlikely that another round of fiscal stimulus will be passed before the election."" 
An extra $600 a week for the unemployed, provided under the $2.3 trillion government aid package passed in March, expired in July, and most of the hundreds of billions of dollars to cover payrolls at small businesses also provided under the aid package has now been spent.
That could weigh on voters if the labor market fails to gain more steam, causing ""some problems for the incumbent,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors. 
A new $300 weekly benefit for the unemployed, authorized by Trump, could provide some cushion, though the funding only covers six weeks of payouts. 
New U.S. cases of COVID-19 have declined since July, but the virus is still circulating at high enough rates that many businesses are only allowed to operate at reduced capacity, and some not at all. That limits potential economic growth for the nation as a whole.

""The better the economy does, and the more hopeful people are that there’s going to be a rebound, it probably works for Trump,"" said Steven Englander, a managing director at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank. But with government aid waning as Nov. 3 approaches, ""that could be pretty bad timing for the president.""

Latin America's third largest economy completed its ninth sovereign default last month but a handful of European Union- and UK-based ""retail"" investors were omitted, along with some Japanese bondholders, because of certain regulation and language issues.
Some of those holders had been growing concerned that they could either be left in limbo or receive reduced terms because the offer accepted by heavyweight funds such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), GMO, Fidelity and Ashmore incentivised immediate sign-up.
The situation had also raised questions about whether the EU's MiFID II regulations had complicated matters, making it a potentially unwanted precedent with restructurings also possibly looming for other hard-up countries.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Once billed as the diplomatic high point in China-European Union relations, a summit on Monday is likely to show how far the relationship has ebbed, with the main achievement a deal involving Irish whiskey and Pixian bean paste.
Originally due to take place in Leipzig, the summit will be held by video and bring together Chinese President Xi Jinping with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the EU's chief executive and its chairman, after a tense video call in June.
In contrast to a summit in April 2019, when Xi pledged to open up the Chinese economy to EU companies, the meeting is set to show how wide the differences are on issues ranging from climate to trade, Hong Kong and the coronavirus.
""The ball is deep in the Chinese court when it comes to building a reciprocal trade relationship,"" said a senior EU official preparing the meeting, which starts at 1200 GMT on Monday. No final communique is planned, EU officials said. 
European attitudes have hardened towards Beijing because of the novel coronavirus, which many scientists believe originated in China, and because of a new security law on Hong Kong that the West says curtails basic rights.
The EU has warned China of consequences over its security law in the former British colony of Hong Kong, although it has avoided economic sanctions. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has described China as a ""new empire"", urging the bloc to take a tougher stance on Beijing.
The EU and China will sign a deal to protect European regional food designations in China and Chinese equivalents in the EU.
The pact significantly expands the number of foods protected as ""geographical indications"" (GIs) and should help boost trade in higher-value goods such as Irish whiskey, feta and China's Pixian bean paste.
However, efforts to agree an investment pact by the end of the year, which would give European companies greater access to the Chinese market, have stumbled.

The EU also wants China to strive to end its role as a top world polluter and to stop construction of coal-based power stations, also ending financing of them elsewhere. That means China should bring forward its year of peak greenhouse gas emissions to 2025 from 2030, the EU says.

If it's autumn with a year-end deadline and a sterling sell-off, it must be Brexit. Britain's internal market bill, a bombshell which the government readily admits contravenes international law, may wreck its EU divorce treaty, scupper chances of a post-Brexit trade agreement and trigger EU legal action.
Britain's lower house of parliament starts debating the bill on Monday. While Prime Minister Boris Johnson has an 80-seat majority, internal party rumblings over the bill could well test his authority. 
Meanwhile, sterling has lost 4% this month and at $1.28, it may not even be pricing the full risk. Clearer signals come from options markets, where positioning has turned markedly bearish.

2/CUE THE FED 
The Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday for the first time since unveiling its landmark shift to a more tolerant stance on inflation. That move steepened the Treasury curve, lifting longer-dated borrowing costs and expectations the Fed may have to increase purchases of long-dated bonds to tamp down yields. 
The gap between 5- and 30-year yields  has contracted since hitting three-month highs after Fed chief Jerome Powell flagged the shift on Aug. 27. But 30-year yields (US30YT=RR), sensitive to inflation expectations, remain elevated - not great news for the battered economy. 
Fed purchases of more than $1.5 trillion of shorter-dated bonds during the pandemic have pinned down front-end borrowing costs. Investors will watch for a shift towards the long end.

3/FOLLOW THE LEADER 
The Fed move towards greater inflation tolerance, essentially a pledge to keep policy loose, puts other central banks in a bind. Unless they follow, the dollar's weakening against their currencies could threaten economic recovery and their inflation targets.
The ECB says euro strength is not yet a concern. But it, along with British and Japanese peers which meet in coming days, may eventually be forced down the Fed's looser-for-longer route.
No policy changes are expected in Japan and Britain. Still, the Bank of England may flag extending its bond-buying to help an economy reeling from COVID-19 and Brexit.
The Bank of Japan (BOJ) meanwhile must contend with a new premier, likely Yoshihide Suga, who may not hesitate to pressure the central bank over yen strength. Calling for the BOJ to work with the government, Suga said recently he didn't buy arguments such as negative rates hitting bank profits.

4/ TAKE A BREAK
Emerging markets have been hot on the heels of advanced peers in cutting interest rates, but inflation pressures driven by weak currencies could force a pause.
Brazil is seen holding rates at 2% on Wednesday. Indonesia too should stand pat, given its debt monetization scheme has knocked the rupiah hard. The rouble's tumble to four-year lows could induce Russia's central bank to hold rates at 4.25% on Friday.
Yet South Africa may have little choice but to ease policy further on Thursday, after a data horror show that revealed a record 51% GDP plunge and a huge current account gap.

5/BACK IN LOCKDOWN
COVID-19 cases are rising again in Asian nations that appeared to have successfully controlled the outbreak. Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, is back in lockdown and its markets have duly crumbled. 
But Indonesia is only part of the story. Trade-and-tourism-dependent stock markets in Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia have shed 18% to 24% this year and corporate earnings are seen sinking by a third. Australian shares are at 2-1/2-month lows, as Asian growth fears hurt commodities. 
India, despite a four-month lockdown, has the world's second-highest number of coronavirus cases. Not long ago, the fastest growing major economy, it will contract 14.8% this year, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) predicts.

The consumer price index rose 0.4% from the prior month, following a 0.6% gain in July, Labor Department figures showed Friday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.3% increase. Compared with a year earlier, the gauge increased 1.3%, after July’s 1% rise.
Excluding volatile food and fuel costs, the so-called core CPI -- viewed by policy makers as a more reliable gauge of price trends -- also increased 0.4% from the prior month, driven by used-car prices, after a 0.6% jump in July that was the largest in almost three decades. On an annual basis, core inflation measured 1.7% following 1.6% in July.

549,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 08:30AM ET</span>",Argentina debt deal opens door for $13 billion provincial revamp,"By Hernan Nessi and Jorge Otaola
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's provinces from Buenos Aires to wine region Mendoza are readying to revamp a combined $13 billion in debt, after a successful sovereign debt restructuring opened the door for local governments to resolve their regional crises.
The South American country's government restructured almost $110 billion in dollar debt in recent weeks, dragging itself out of default, a major victory after a standoff with creditors had threatened to scupper a deal.
""It was crucial for Argentina to close this deal to have a more friendly and attractive deal for the provinces,"" said Gerardo Mato, chairman of global banking Americas at HSBC, who was involved in the sovereign negotiations.
He said that sovereign and provincial bonds would be much lower if the central government had remained stuck in default.
The sovereign deal on foreign-law bonds gave creditors around 55 cents on the dollar, which enabled the government to restructure 99% of the eligible debt. That saw ratings agencies upgrade the country, and its risk index fell sharply.
Gabriel Monzón, an economist and head of Grupo Latina Consultores, said the sovereign revamp would give confidence to the provinces to reach similar deals.
""The provinces are cheering about their restructurings because the success of the national government put a ceiling on their negotiations,"" he said.
At the front of the cue is wealthy and populous Buenos Aires province, which is racing to restructure over $7 billion in bonds to escape from default as it grapples with a nationwide recession that has left it struggling to pay its bills.
The province faces a deadline on Friday to strike a deal, though that cut-off could be extended. Mendoza, known for its Malbec wines, is also facing a Friday deadline after an earlier offer was rejected by its creditor committee.
Argentina brokerage Balanz said in a report that Mendoza looked close to sealing its deal, while creditors were waiting for Buenos Aires province, known as PBA, to sweeten its offer.
""Our feeling with PBA is that investors would ask for better conditions than the ones the sovereign got,"" it said.
Around the country, Córdoba is restructuring some $1.95 billion; oil region Neuquén $700 million; Chubut $680 million; Mendoza $590 million http://www.hacienda.mendoza.gov.ar/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2020/08/1598571425299_Province-of-Mendoza-Extension-of-Expiration-and-Consent-Payment-Eligibility-Deadline-2.pdf; Entre Ríos $500 million, and Salta $390 million, according to government data and private reports.

""Market expectations are optimistic and everything would indicate that while things are moving at a slow pace, most provincial negotiations will bear fruit,"" said consulting firm Portfolio Personal Inversiones.

550,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 07:47AM ET</span>",Euro zone ministers pledge lasting fiscal support for economy,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers pledged continued fiscal support on Friday to get their economies running again after the COVID-19 crisis, chairman of the Eurogroup Paschal Donohoe said after they met in Berlin.
At their first in-person meeting since February, finance ministers from the 19 countries that share the euro talked informally about the fiscal response to the pandemic that has savaged the European economy since March.
""There will be no sudden stop, no policy cliff-edge and overall budgetary policy will continue to support the economy,"" Donohoe, who is Ireland's finance minister, told a news conference after the meeting. 
While the ministers did not pledge any addition to the vast sums already promised to keep the economy going, they made clear there would not be fiscal tightening any time soon and that they would keep their foot on the accelerator as long as needed.
European Union governments have already announced more than 3.7 trillion euros in various support measures for their economies since the pandemic started and the bloc has added another 1.3 trillion euros that could be tapped over time.
The latter includes a recovery package of 750 billion euros in grants and loans that the EU as a whole will borrow on financial markets and spend over the next three years to boost growth. The package is now going through the European Parliament and is expected to be ready by Jan. 1.
In total, government support in various forms is almost 36% of EU gross domestic product, on top of unprecedented European Central Bank support measures. This is boosting European public debt levels, but growth is now the ministers' priority.
""Concerning the fiscal stance for 2021, given the current high level of uncertainty ... a premature withdrawal of support would put the fragile recovery in jeopardy,"" EU Economics Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said.
""If we miscalculate the timing of this landing, we risk damaging the European economy.""
Ministers also expressed support for pushing forward with stalled projects such as the EU's banking union, which still lacks a common deposit guarantee scheme. 

The European Commission expects the EU economy to shrink by an unprecedented 8.3% in 2020 after 1.5% growth in 2019 because of the economic disruption caused by the pandemic.

551,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 06:47AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday, September 11th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Donald Trump squeezes TikTok owner ByteDance, Sterling tumbles again on fears of a messy Brexit, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) indicates signs of weak sales in China and oil continues to struggle after U.S. crude stockpiles snap a streak of summer declines. Here's what you need to know on Friday, September 11th.
1. Trump puts the squeeze on TikTok
President Donald Trump ramped up the pressure on Bytedance, owner of the video-streaming service TikTok, threatening to shut the service down in the U.S. if there’s no deal to sell it by September 15th.
“We’ll either close up TikTok in this country for security reasons, or it will be sold,” Trump told reporters on Thursday. “There will be no extension of the TikTok deadline.”
In response, Bytedance let Reuters know that it plans to move its headquarters to Singapore and invest billions of dollars there over the next three years, in what looks like an effort to forestall the U.S. move.
2. ECB officials walk back Lagarde's optimism
The European Central Bank’s chief economist said again that the strength of the euro is an important factor in its thinking, a day after President Christine Lagarde’s first press conference of the autumn.
“It should be abundantly clear that there is no room for complacency,” Philip Lane wrote in a blog post on the ECB website. “Inflation remains far below the aim and there has been only partial progress in combating the negative impact of the pandemic on projected inflation dynamics.”   
The euro dipped on the news before rising again by late morning in Europe.
Lagarde’s upbeat tone, and her refusal to accept invitations to talk the euro down, had surprised many analysts, but were consistent with a modest upward revision to the ECB’s growth forecast for this year. Lane’s intervention will raise further eyebrows over the ECB’s communication policy. Lagarde’s predecessor Mario Draghi rarely needed his chief economist to explain his comments a day after the bank’s most important set-piece events.
3. Stocks set to open higher; Tesla hints at China weakness
U.S. stocks are set to end a volatile week on a firm note, as investors find a way back to focusing on an economic recovery that appears to be still largely intact.
By 6:30 AM ET, Dow 30 futures were up 187 points or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract and the NASDAQ Futures contract were both up 0.9%.
The market will be on the lookout for consumer inflation figures for August at 8:30, ready to pounce on anything that smacks of a pretext for further stimulus from the Federal Reserve (there’s none coming from Congress after the Republicans’ slimmed-down package of measures failed in the Senate on Thursday).
Stocks in the spotlight will include Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which is reportedly planning to start exporting from its factory in Shanghai. Analysts saw the news as a sign that sales in the world’s largest electric vehicle market may be flagging.  Also of note will be JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), which has ordered its investment bankers back to the office.
4. Pound tumbles again after EU ultimatum
The pound tumbled further, especially against the euro, after the EU issued an ultimatum to London to withdraw proposed legislation that would breach the terms of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement.
The U.K. rejected the ultimatum and will go ahead with its new Internal Markets Bill which it admits is a “limited and specific” breach of international law.
Sterling fell as low at 1.0762 against the euro before rebounding a bit to be at 1.0812, down 0.2% on the day. It’s fallen over 5% against the single currency this week as Prime Minister Boris Johnson has revived the threat of a disorderly end to the post-Brexit transition period at the end of the year.
The pound's mini-rebound came after the U.K. and Japan agreed the broad outlines of a deal to govern their trade relations when the transition period ends.
5. Oil struggles after U.S. stockpile rise
U.S. crude prices fell below $37 a barrel overnight before rebounding somewhat, after U.S. government data confirmed a rise in crude oil stockpiles last week.
Crude inventories rose by some 2 million barrels, snapping a streak of nearly two months of uninterrupted draws on stockpiles.
By 6:40, U.S. crude futures traded up 0.1% on the day at $37.35 a barrel, still on course for a hefty loss for the week. Brent futures were down 0.2% at $39.98 a barrel.
Baker Hughes’ rig count data round off the week later.

553,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>","ECB policymakers highlight risk from strong euro, nuancing Lagarde message","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymakers warned on Friday against complacency over low inflation and highlighted risks from a strong euro, nuancing the bank's benign message from a day earlier, which some argued denied difficult realities.
Speaking a day after the ECB took an unexpectedly relaxed stance on growth and inflation at its regular policy meeting, chief economist Philip Lane and French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau both highlighted risks from a strong currency, noting that it clearly mattered for policy because it curbed price pressures.
ECB board member Isabel Schnabel also emphasised the ECB would ""be careful to not choke the incipient recovery"" by tightening its ultra-easy policy of massive bond purchases and negative rates on bank deposits too early. 
ECB President Christine Lagarde had on Thursday said the ECB would merely ""carefully"" monitor the exchange rate, the weakest form of verbal intervention, which actually sent the euro up as investors started to doubt the ECB's resolve to add to stimulus. 
But Friday's comment, including Lane's emphasis that more data in the coming months would help calibrate policy, is likely to reinforce market expectations that the ECB will eventually expand its 1.35 trillion euro ($1.6 trillion) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, possibly as soon as December.
""Inflation remains far below the aim and there has been only partial progress in combating the negative impact of the pandemic on projected inflation dynamics,"" Lane said in a blog post. ""It should be abundantly clear that there is no room for complacency.""
Villeroy also took aim at the euro, which has firmed 8% against the dollar since the start of the coronavirus crisis in spring, and earlier this month hit $1.20, a key psychological level that has in the past triggered ECB concern.
""We don't target exchange rates,"" Villeroy said in a speech. ""But obviously the exchange rate does matter for inflation and monetary policy.""
Both policymakers also repeated the ECB's standard message that the bank was ready to do more, if needed.
The euro (EUR=) was trading around $1.1840 early on Friday, not far from its levels before the ECB meeting. It is generally expected to firm over the coming months after the U.S. Federal Reserve shifted strategy, suggesting it would raise rates more slowly than in the past and so encouraging investors to seek returns elsewhere. 
But sources close to Thursday's discussion said the ECB had opted for the benign message because 1.20 is not far from what they consider the equilibrium exchange rate and is no longer the key threshold it once was.
Still, Lane echoed Villeroy's message on the euro, arguing that its recent appreciation dampens inflation, which is expected to remain persistently below the ECB's target of almost 2%. 

Lane added that inflation in the 19-country euro zone would remain negative for the rest of this year, even if August's especially weak underlying inflation readings were skewed by exceptional factors.

In a letter, the ECB has asked euro zone finance ministers, meeting for informal talks in Berlin, to start the process.
The chairman of the ministers will invite each euro zone country to present a candidate, if they wish to, over the next month. 
Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra said the Netherlands would propose Frank Elderson, who has been an Executive Director of Supervision at Dutch central bank since 2011. 
Mersch is now also the deputy chair of the ECB's supervision arm and since there’s no other supervision expert on the ECB board, whoever succeeds him is likely to take on the supervisory role as well.
The six-person executive board of the bank manages its day-to-day operations and members are appointed for 8-year terms that cannot be renewed.
At the next euro zone ministers' meeting one of the candidates will be chosen with a simple majority of votes, where each euro zone country has one vote.

The candidate will then have a hearing in the European Parliament, which cannot block any candidacies, and be formally appointed by European Union leaders at their summit in December.

555,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 04:25AM ET</span>",UK respect for EU divorce treaty a must for any trade deal: Donohoe,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - Britain must respect its commitments in the withdrawal treaty it signed with the European Union if it wants to have an agreement on future trade relations with the bloc, the chairman of euro zone finance ministers Pascal Donohoe said on Friday.
In one of the most extraordinary turns since the 2016 Brexit referendum, Britain explicitly said this week that it plans to break international law by breaching parts of the Withdrawal Agreement treaty it signed in January.
This plunged talks on a future trade relationship between the EU and Britain into crisis less than four months before the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU's orbit at the end of a transition period. 
""As the United Kingdom looks to what kind of future trade relationship it wants with the European Union, a prerequisite for that is honouring agreements that are already in place,"" Donohoe told reporters on entering talks of euro zone ministers. 
The European Commission, which conducts talks on the future trade deal with London on behalf of the 27-nation bloc, asked Britain on Thursday to drop by the end of September the parts of a planned bill that would break the treaty with the EU.
""It is imperative that the government of the United Kingdom respond back to the call from the Commission ... this is a prerequisite to what any future relationship could look like,"" Donohoe said.
German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, speaking to reporters, said the EU would be open to a deal with Britain until the ""last moment"", but Britain had to respect what it had agreed to.
""Treaties have to be respected – anyone knows that. My view on the trade discussions is the following: You have to do it up to the last moment, but you have to be very clear,"" Scholz said.
The bill Britain wants to pass would override provisions in the withdrawal treaty meant to ensure Britain would not give companies exporting to the EU an unfair advantage by subsidising them. The EU is sensitive to keeping competition with Britain fair after Brexit.

""We will not accept anything that could jeopardise or weaken the single European market,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.

LISBON (Reuters) - By this time of year, Ilene Steele, 63, would usually have several trips behind her: one to visit family in the United States, a holiday in Italy, and a few day excursions in London, where she lives with her retired therapist husband Mike. 
She'd be meeting friends for drinks and dinners, and enjoying manicures and pedicures with her daughter.
But not this year, even after lockdowns to counter the COVID-19 pandemic eased. 
""We hardly go out, really,"" the retired jeweller said. ""We haven't traveled. We thought about going to Greece - in a way it's so appealing when you know there aren't many tourists - but honestly, I'd feel pretty stupid if I died.""
As coronavirus cases rise again across Europe, spending data shows that fear of infection is deterring many wealthier consumers from splashing out. That spells trouble for retailers, luxury goods and leisure firms desperate to make up lost ground.
Between the risk of contracting the virus and the hassle of safety measures - from needing to put on paper socks before trying on trainers, to plastic screens dividing customers at the hairdresser - the fun of going out is lost, Steele feels.
""It's like being at an operating table,"" she said of images she'd seen of restaurants with barriers between diners. ""I just wouldn't enjoy that.""
Consumer transaction studies in countries including Britain, Denmark, France and Sweden show a pattern also seen in the United States: even as shops re-opened, high-income consumers kept their wallets zipped up.
British consumers earning 40,000 pounds ($51,250) or more after tax accounted for around 35% of spending in 2019, but 45% of the decline in the second quarter of 2020, a study of card transaction data by London Business School professor Paolo Surico and others showed.
""High-income groups spend in areas with a so-called 'multiplier effect' - non-essential services which employ lower-income groups,"" Surico explained. ""We want to engineer a situation where the young and the poor can save a bit more, and the older spend. But it's happening the wrong way around.""
A comparative study by economist Asger Lau Andersen and others analysed spending from March to May by 860,000 consumers in Denmark, which imposed heavy coronavirus restrictions, and Sweden, which did not, but saw more infections. 
The data showed spending in Denmark falling by just 4% more than in Sweden, and the elderly in Sweden actually cutting back more than the same age group in Denmark. 
""Our interpretation is that the higher COVID incidence in Sweden made this high-risk group more cautious, despite stronger formal restrictions in Denmark,"" Andersen said.
EARLY SIGNS
The resurgence of the virus, coupled with the winding down of furlough schemes in some countries, could further dampen demand on the lower-income side of the spectrum, particularly in sectors like grocery which until now have proved resilient.
Data scraped by analytics firm StyleSage from online clothing companies' websites including Zara (MC:ITX), Asos (L:ASOS), Mango, Net-A-Porter and New Look in August showed 6-10% more products on discount than last year at 2-4% lower prices, as retailers pre-empt a fall in purchasing power.
Surico's study of the UK, where a furlough scheme is being gradually phased out, showed those receiving government benefits returned to 2019 spending levels in June, while those not on government support remained 30% below last year's levels.
Still, card transaction data from analytics firm Fable Data shows UK retail sales rose in August, recovering to just above 2019 levels by the end of the month. Consumers shifted spending from entertainment, leisure and transport toward cars, car maintenance, home improvements and sporting goods, it showed.
Grocery retailers are for now still benefiting from people eating in, rather than out. Sales of fresh fruit and vegetables in Germany at Aldi, Europe's second largest grocery retailer, continue to be higher than usual, a spokeswoman said.
But in Portugal, where a steady rise in cases since June has led to partial lockdowns and a plunge in tourism threatening thousands of jobs, August figures already point to a contraction in grocery sales, according to Portuguese grocery network APED. 
""Consumption doesn't only go down because people are scared of going to shops,"" head of APED Goncalo Lobo Xavier said. ""It's also their finances they are worried about.""

The poll on Friday also found consumer prices slumped to its lowest in more than three years, highlighting deflation risks and the challenge facing Japan's next leader in engineering a broad revival.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga is on course to succeed incumbent Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is stepping down for health reasons. 
Exports were expected to have fallen 16.1% in August from a year earlier, with the decline easing slightly from a 19.2% drop in July, the poll of 16 economists showed.
The poll also forecast an 18% year-on-year decline in imports after a 22.3% drop in July, with a trade deficit of 37.5 trillion yen ($353.21 billion) 
""Worsening corporate earnings and uncertainty over the outlook likely dragged down shipments of capital goods, which weighed on the total exports,"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
The finance ministry will publish trade data at 8:50 a.m. on Wednesday (2350 GMT Tuesday).
Japan is grappling with its worst postwar recession, and expectations are that any recovery will be modest as businesses face tough global conditions in light of the still-rising coronavirus cases worldwide. Consumers also remain wary about the outlook.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, is forecast to have declined 0.4% in August from a year earlier, the biggest drop since late 2016. 
The key driver in the core CPI downturn was a price decline in accommodations after the government excluded people living or vacationing in Tokyo from a subsidised domestic tourism campaign. 
""There was a resurgence in the coronavirus cases in some areas,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, adding that many people cutback on spending on tourism and other services.
The government will publish CPI data at 8:30 a.m. on Friday. 
The poll also showed the Bank of Japan would keep its policy interest rate at minus 0.1%, and the 10-year Japanese government bond yield target at around 0% when it holds a policy meeting on September 16-17. The BOJ has eased policy twice this year to cushion the coronavirus-stricken economy.

Over the past 48 hours, four people died from fires in California, while four were killed in Oregon and a 1-year-old boy died in Washington state, police reported. 
The number of people under evacuation orders in Oregon alone climbed late in the day to some 500,000, about an eighth of the state's total population, a spokeswoman for the state Office of Emergency Management said.
Thousands more were displaced north and south in the neighboring states of Washington and California.
Oregon has borne the brunt of nearly 100 major wildfires raging across the western United States this week. Around 3,000 firefighters have been battling nearly three dozen blazes in Oregon, and fire officials saying about twice as many personnel are needed to bring those conflagrations under control.
Police have opened a criminal arson investigation into at least one Oregon blaze, the Almeda Fire, which started in Ashland (NYSE:ASH) near the border with California and incinerated several hundred homes in adjacent communities along Bear Creek, Ashland Police Chief Tighe O'Meara said.
O'Meara said investigators were treating the origins of the Almeda fire as suspicious. 
""We have good reason to believe that there was a human element to it, so we're going to pursue it as a criminal investigation until we have reason to believe that it was otherwise,"" he told Reuters.
O'Meara said he expected the death toll from the Almeda Fire, initially blamed for two of Oregon's fatalities, to rise as search teams combed through the ruins of dwellings that burned in the midst of a chaotic evacuation.
The Oregon blazes tore through at least five communities in the Cascade mountain range as well as areas of coastal rainforest normally spared from wildfires. In eastern Washington state a fire destroyed most of the tiny farming town of Malden.
In central Oregon search-and-rescue teams entered devastated communities like Detroit, where firefighters led residents on a dramatic mountain escape after military helicopters were unable to evacuate the town.
A 12-year-old boy was found dead with his dog inside a burned-out car and his grandmother was believed to have succumbed after flames engulfed an area near Lyons, about 50 miles (80 km) south of Portland, the Marion County Sheriff's Office said.
""EMBERS GOING FOR MILES""
To the south, a Reuters photographer saw small communities near the city of Medford, including Bear Lake Estates, reduced to ashes as he drove south on Interstate 5 toward Ashland. 
Some people counted their blessings after fleeing the Bear Creek trailer park where nearly every house burned.
""Thank God we were at home,"" said Julio Flores, who escaped with two children who would have been alone had his restaurant working hours not been cut due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Firefighters said unusually hot, dry winds out of the east supercharged blazes, spreading flames from community to community, and then from house to house.
""When it really gets windy these embers are going for miles,"" said Firefighter Andy Cardinal in Eagle Point, north of Medford where the town of around 10,000 was on standby to evacuate.
Oregon Governor Kate Brown said some 900,000 acres had burned, dwarfing the state's annual 500,000-acre average over the past decade.
""We have never seen this amount of uncontained fire across the state,"" Brown told a news conference. ""We are feeling the acute impacts of climate change.""
Climate scientists say global warming has contributed to greater extremes in wet and dry seasons, causing vegetation to flourish then dry out in the U.S. West, leaving more abundant, volatile fuel for fires.
By evening, two of Oregon's largest fires, burning around 24 miles southeast of downtown Portland, had merged, leading to a major expansion of evacuations in densely populated Clackamas County, emergency management spokeswoman Bobbi Doan said.
Asked whether Portland's metro areas might be evacuated, Chief Deputy State Fire Marshal Mariana Ruiz Temple said everything would depend on wind direction and force. 
CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON FIRES 
In California, officials said some 64,000 people were under evacuation orders while crews battled 29 major fires across portions of the most populous U.S. state.
About a third of those evacuees were displaced in Butte County alone, north of Sacramento, the capital, where the North Complex wildfire has scorched more than 247,000 acres and destroyed over 2,000 homes and structures.
The remains of three victims were found in two separate locations of that fire zone, according to Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea, bringing the total death toll from California wildfires so far this summer to at least 11.
A 12th person died in Siskiyou County in far northern California, state fire authority CalFire reported, providing no further details.
Wildfires have now burned over 3.1 million acres in California in 2020, marking a record for any year, with six of the top 20 largest wildfires in state history occurring in 2020. 

In Washington, a man and a woman were in critical condition with burns after their 1-year-old son died as they tried to escape the state's largest wildfire burning in mountains about 100 miles northwest of Spokane, the Okanogan County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.

“Abe once said the sales tax doesn’t need to be raised for about next 10 years. My thinking is the same,” Suga said.
The remarks came after he commented on a TV program Thursday that a further increase in the tax is inevitable in the future given Japan’s aging population.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese companies plan to make the deepest cut in capital expenditure in more than a decade this year as the coronavirus pandemic hits profits, a government survey showed, underscoring the broadening economic impact of the health crisis.
The dismal reading highlights the challenge facing Japan's next prime minister, to be chosen in a ruling party leadership race next week, as policymakers try to balance the need to contain the virus and support an economy grappling with its worst postwar recession.
""Companies have little choice but to slash spending when their profit outlook is so gloomy,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Japan could see more companies cut spending and jobs toward the year-end, which means it will take quite a long time for the economy to return to pre-pandemic levels,"" he said.
Companies plan to cut capital expenditure by 6.8% in the fiscal year ending in March 2021, the quarterly survey showed on Friday, more than a 4.4% drop projected three months ago.
It was the biggest proposed cut since January-March 2010, when Japanese exports were crunched by the global financial crisis.
Manufacturers expect to reduce capital expenditure by 4.5% compared with a year earlier, while non-manufacturers plan a 8.1% reduction, the survey showed, suggesting that slumping profits were denting spending appetite across industries.
Companies expect sales to fall 6.8% in the current fiscal year, more than a 5.2% drop projected three months ago and the biggest decline since 2010.
They expect recurring profits to plunge 23.2%, the fastest pace of decline since 2009, with automakers and service-sector firms among those hit hardest by the crisis.

Japan suffered its worst postwar economic contraction in the second quarter as COVID-19 hit businesses. Analysts expect only a modest rebound in the current quarter.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve's latest policy shift will not have any significant impact on the economy, according to a majority of economists in a Reuters poll who do not expect the central bank to meet its dual mandate until 2023 at least.
In a landmark shift to a more tolerant stance on inflation, the Fed's new monetary policy strategy pledged to address maximum employment by letting inflation run above its 2% target and suggested interest rates would stay near zero for years to come.
But the Sept. 8-10 poll showed the Fed's preferred inflation gauge - the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index - was forecast to average 1.3% this year, 1.5% next and 1.7% in 2022, largely unchanged from the previous poll.
Over three-quarters of 47 economists responding to an additional question said the Fed's change would not have any significant impact on the U.S. economy, which suffered its biggest fall since the Great Depression last quarter.
""While the Fed's step to make the inflation target 'more' symmetric may benefit the wages of the average American somewhere beyond 2022, it could be argued the Fed's policies have become part of the problem, instead of the solution,"" said Philip Marey, senior U.S. strategist at Rabobank.
""The current crisis response has made it painfully clear again that the Fed's policies contributed to a form of capitalism where the rewards benefit high income individuals and large corporations, while small businesses and low income individuals bear the burden.""

https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/bdwpkzbjkvm/US%20economy.PNG
Despite unprecedented stimulus, recent data showed the labor market recovery was slowing as the COVID-19 pandemic persists and government money to support workers and employers dries up. But U.S. stock and government bond prices have skyrocketed.
While unemployment was forecast to fall gradually - averaging 8.6% this year, 7.3% next and 5.6% in 2022, that would still be well above the pre-COVID-19 rate of 3.5%.
A recent Fed report showed furloughed workers during the pandemic are increasingly being laid off permanently in some states. But economists with a view were mostly split on the risk of the job recovery reversing by end-2020.
""The U.S. is bouncing strongly off Q2 lows, but after an initial economic reopening we see modest growth and difficulties in absorbing unemployed labor,"" Stephen Gallagher, chief U.S. economist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) wrote in a research note.
""Fiscal policy stumbled in August with Congress failing to approve another stimulus package that would extend enhanced unemployment benefits and offer clarity on mortgage forbearance. These factors could slow the recovery more than expected in Q4, but we do not yet see much sign of such a slowdown.""
Despite a resurgence in coronavirus cases and after having contracted 31.7% last quarter, the U.S. economy was forecast to rebound and grow 25.0% this quarter and 5.3% next, on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis. For 2020, the economy was forecast to on average contract 4.9%.
That compared to 32.9% contraction in Q2, growth of 18.8% in Q3 and 6.1% in Q4 predicted last month, and a 5.3% contraction for the full year predicted previously.
While the consensus under a worst-case scenario showed some optimism compared to last month, the outlook and the range of expectations under any scenario for next year pointed to less optimistic views, underscoring the lack of confidence in forecasting a significant recovery.
""Uncertainties over the timing and efficacy of a vaccine coupled with the threat of a renewed spike in COVID-19 cases in the latter part of the year mean the strains facing the travel, hospitality and entertainment industries will continue,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.
""Given these sectors are relatively large in the U.S. this adds to our wariness on getting too excited about the speed of recovery.""
Asked which presidential candidate's policies would generate the best U.S. economic outcome in the long run, 27 of 39 respondents chose Democrat Joe Biden over incumbent Republican President Donald Trump.
""Income and wealth inequality is extreme and causing economic and political instability. Biden's policies will better address these issues. Policy uncertainty will be reduced, making it easier to plan and do business,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A majority of Japanese firms want top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga to become the next prime minister as many see no need to change the status quo on stimulus policy at least until the coronavirus crisis ends, a Reuters poll found.
Highlighting worry about snowballing public debt, however, fiscal reform topped firms' wish list for the incoming government, the poll found, underlining the difficulty to contain the virus and revive the economy while putting the fiscal house in order.
Few picked the ""womenomics"" policy of boosting the role of women in the economy and politics, the survey showed.
Suga, seen as a favourite to succeed Shinzo Abe, who is stepping down due to poor health, is widely expected to win the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) leadership election on Sept. 14. The winner is virtually assured of becoming prime minister with the LDP's parliamentary majority.
The Corporate Survey found 56% of firms want Suga to become premier, outdistancing the other candidates - former defence chief Shigeru Ishiba and former foreign minister Fumio Kishida.
""We cannot expect major reform but we should aim for economic recovery by extending the status quo,"" a machinery maker manager wrote in the survey.
""The health crisis has boosted fiscal spending, and there's a limit to postponing debt repayment,"" wrote a pulp and paper firm manager. ""We don't want to face tax hikes"" to repay public debt.
The survey, conducted for Reuters by Nikkei Research from Aug. 31 through Sept. 9, canvassed 485 large and mid-sized non-financial firms. About 230 firms answered the questions, on condition of anonymity.
In the survey, 85% of firms saw greater benefits than demerits from nearly eight years of the ""Abenomics"" policy mix of aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus and reform.
Many companies said they seek no change in economic policy and called for more stimulus as a majority saw no end to the pandemic.
Still, the survey showed fiscal reform topped the agenda, picked by one-third of firms, a sign of growing worry about the industrial world's heaviest public debt burden.

Fiscal reform was followed by boosting economic ties with other countries and digital transformation.

Tourism has been brought to its knees by collapsing demand on the back of travel restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the virus, which has infected more than 27 million people globally and killed nearly 900,000.
The hit from the pandemic would leave the industry in Latin America and the Caribbean barely a third the size it was last year, according to the data from WTTC, the main global forum representing tourism. 
Job losses will be of a similar scale, the group forecasts.
""There is no country that escapes,"" Gloria Guevara, president of the group, told Reuters in an interview this week.
In Mexico, the country that receives the most visitors in Latin America, the tourism sector is expecting to rack up losses worth $129 billion. Almost five million people are expected to lose jobs, equating to about 69% of the work force in Mexican tourism.
Guevara said the industry has complained about the lack of support from Mexico's government.
Globally, the pandemic threatens to trigger losses worth $5.5 trillion in tourism and 197.5 million job losses, the WTTC says.
The sector has been further hamstrung by a lack of standardised protocols to manage travel when borders reopen, including issues such as airport testing to give tourists greater confidence and help accelerate the recovery, Guevara said.
""Unfortunately there has been very little international coordination,"" she said. 
Guevara said she expected the recovery to take 18 months if there is global collaboration and the appropriate measures are taken.

""If not, on average, it will easily be three or four years.""

Skoda is the central European country's biggest exporter, but its success has sometimes caused friction within Volkswagen, whose labour boss has accused it of cannibalising sales.
Jaroslav Povsik, Skoda's trade union chairman and supervisory board member, said the company planned to move production of the luxury Skoda Superb and SUV Skoda Kodiaq to Slovakia and Germany respectively, while another SUV, Seat brand's Ateca, was set to go to Spain.
""Isn't this campaign against Skoda enough? Do we have to strip Skoda of all that is good and excellent that we have now?"" Povsik said in a front-page article in the union's weekly bulletin, Skodovacky Odborar.

In a decision late Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California overruled defense objections to letting a psychologist and psychiatrist chosen by the government examine the 36-year-old Holmes for 14 hours over two days, and having the examinations recorded on video.
Davila authorized the examinations after Holmes' lawyers said they intended to introduce expert evidence from a clinical psychologist ""relating to a mental disease or defect or any other mental condition of the defendant bearing on the issue of guilt.""
The defense expert, Mindy Mechanic, is a California State University at Fullerton professor specializing in psychosocial consequences of violence, trauma and victimization, including violence against women, and often testifies in cases involving interpersonal violence, according to her university biography.
Lawyers for Holmes did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment. The professor did not immediately respond to a similar request.
Wednesday's decision was partially redacted. Holmes' mental state had been previously discussed in sealed court documents and a closed July 8 hearing.

(Reuters) - Wildfires across the U.S. West are among the sparks from climate change that could ignite a U.S. financial crisis by damaging home values, state tourism and local government budgets, an advisory panel to a U.S. markets regulator found. 
Those effects could set off a cascade of events including defaults and market disruptions, undermining the U.S. economy and sparking a crisis. Here's how:
MORE FREQUENT AND INTENSE FIRES
Global warming is making the U.S. West hotter and drier, with wildfires more frequent and intense, scientists say. 
Economists have traditionally seen natural disasters like wildfires as localized shocks. That's changing, according to the report, produced by a 35-member panel for the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. The group included representatives of major oil companies, banks and asset managers.
LOWER HOME VALUES
CalFire, California's fire-fighting agency, says about 3 million of the state's 12 million homes are at high risk from wildfires. 
That designation hurts home values, which in turn increases mortgage default risk, research cited by the report suggested. More defaults would damage banks, mortgage holders and markets where mortgages are sold. Securities based on mortgages were a trigger for the 2007-2009 financial crisis. 
INSURERS RETREAT FROM COVERAGE 
After 2018, California's worst fire season in terms of loss of life and property, some insurers balked at renewing homeowner policies, forcing a record number of owners to turn to pricey policies from the state's insurer of last resort. 
Expensive insurance also depresses home prices, said former California insurance regulator Dave Jones, a contributor to the CFTC report.
""You can tell the same story in terms of sea level rise and flooding and more intense storms and their impact on residential real estate value,"" said Jones, now a senior director at The Nature Conservancy. 
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
Lower home values reduce cities' real estate tax revenue and impair their ability to repay debt, potentially leading to bond defaults, according to the report. 
Fire-related business disruptions such as a drop in tourism that slashed sales and lodging tax revenue could also hurt municipal finances. Stresses could build in the U.S. financial system in what the report termed ""a systemic crisis in slow motion."" 
MARKET PERCEPTIONS
Climate catastrophes can make investors aware of risks not priced into markets, the report said. 

""A sudden revision of market participants’ perceptions about climate risk could trigger a disorderly repricing of assets, which could have cascading effects on portfolios and balance sheets and, therefore, systemic implications for financial stability,"" the report said.

Funding for the Lost Wages Assistance program, which authorized an extra $300 a week from the federal government to most jobless benefit recipients, will not extend beyond the benefit week ending Sept. 5, according to statements by government officials from Montana, Texas and New Mexico. The states said they were informed Wednesday.
Trump signed an executive action Aug. 8 as a stopgap measure for jobless Americans after lawmakers failed to reach a deal before the added $600 a week in jobless benefits expired at the end of July.
The program authorizes eligible claimants to receive supplemental payments backdated to the week ended Aug. 1. With the latest announcement, that would mean six weeks worth of supplemental assistance.
Payouts Delayed
Logistical hurdles, though, including an approval process, led to a delay in Americans actually receiving the money. Some states have not yet started distributing the funds.
Trump authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency to expend up to $44 billion from the Disaster Relief Fund for the payments. States also had the option to supplement the $300 federal grant with an extra $100.
The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the funding.

HANOI (Reuters) - The United States' top diplomat on Thursday urged Southeast Asian countries to stand up to maritime bullying by China and to reassess business deals with its state firms, adding to heated exchanges between two powers jostling for influence.
Speaking remotely to foreign ministers of the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the region should be confident in the United States and know it can bank on its support. 
""Today, I say keep going. Don't just speak up but act,"" Pompeo said. ""Reconsider business dealings with the very state-owned enterprises that bully ASEAN coastal states in the South China Sea. Don't let the Chinese Communist Party walk over us and our people.""
ASEAN has said it does not want to take sides amid friction over a recent spike in military activities by both powers in the South China Sea and ahead of a November election in which U.S. President Donald Trump will trumpet his tough stand against China. 
Asked about China-U.S. tensions on Tuesday in an interview with Reuters, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said: ""We don't want to get trapped by this rivalry.""
China's State Councillor Wang Yi on Wednesday told the ASEAN ministers that the United States was interfering in the South China Sea and was driving its militarization.
China says it has historical sovereignty over most of the waterway, but its neighbors and the United States say that claim has no basis in international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to which China is a signatory.
In a joint statement released late on Thursday, ASEAN member states said progress had been made in negotiations to draft a code of conduct in the South China Sea that was consistent with international law, including UNCLOS.
""Concerns were expressed by some Ministers on the land reclamations, activities, and serious incidents in the area, which have eroded trust and confidence, increased tensions, and may undermine peace, security, and stability in the region,"" the statement said.
Pompeo's swipe at Chinese firms follows Washington's recent announcement of sanctions on 24 Chinese entities involved in building artificial islands in disputed waters and installing missile systems on them.
U.S. ally the Philippines is among countries where blacklisted firms have secured lucrative contracts. Its president says those will go ahead.
ASEAN ministers also held remote meetings on Thursday with Japan and Australia.
Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Australia was committed to a peaceful Indo-Pacific ""free from coercion and with sovereignty, international law and the rights of all states respected and upheld.""

Vietnam Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh in a statement welcomed the U.S. role in supporting ASEAN's hope for peace, stability, security and freedom of navigation.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos should consider borrowing on the local market to meet its vast financing requirements, a top official said after the finance ministry presented an austere 2021 budget.
Pemex [PEMX.UL] is already the world's most indebted oil company, and billions of dollars in bond repayments are due during the six-year administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
Mexican Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio told Reuters in an interview at the National Palace that about 80% of the oil company's debt is external, and most of it denominated in dollars.
""Under the new model of vertical integration - extraction, production and refining - the logic would probably be that its debt should be held in pesos because so will be its revenues,"" Yorio said late on Wednesday. 
Yorio said that Pemex would probably have to return to foreign debt markets, but that the finance ministry was also talking to the company about turning to the domestic market, including for bond issuance.
Lopez Obrador has sought to export less crude oil and keep more refining business in Mexico. 
If the government goes through with this plan, Mexico would have fewer revenues from oil sales denominated in dollars.
It is not clear whether the local market will have appetite for such large sums. 
Pemex is one of the largest issuers of debt in Latin America: of $107.2 billion total financial debt, nearly 90% is held by bond investors. 
Despite several refinancing transactions, a graphic made public with an earlier draft budget showed the oil company has tens of billions of debt due by the end of Lopez Obrador's term. 
Central Bank Deputy Governor Jonathan Heath called Pemex's financial situation the Mexican government's ""biggest headache"".
Heath called for a solution to a debt burden that is already weighting on the sovereign rating. 
This year, the bonds of the troubled behemoth descended into junk; many investors sold even before the ratings cut and sought out safer assets instead.
Lopez Obrador and other officials insist they are on the right track to save Pemex.

President Christine Lagarde and her colleagues held their pandemic bond-buying program at 1.35 trillion euros ($1.6 trillion) and the deposit rate at -0.5% on Thursday, maintaining the flood of liquidity that has calmed markets and kept borrowing costs low.
Follow the ECB decision and press conference on our live blog
While officials are becoming more confident in the rebound from the worst economic shock in living memory, the upturn has slowed and new risks lie ahead. Infections are rising again and the stronger euro could weigh on inflation. Economists expect the ECB to increase and extend bond purchases later this year.
Lagarde will hold a press conference call at 2:30 p.m. Frankfurt time to explain the ECB’s decision and unveil new projections for output and inflation.
The ECB predicted a record 8.7% contraction for 2020 back in June. That figure will now show an improvement, according to a person familiar with the matter, and the overall forecasts through 2022 will be little changed.
Executive Board members Philip Lane and Isabel Schnabel both said recently that data seen over the summer months more or less confirm the June projections.
Lagarde may choose to address the rise in the euro though, which has jumped more than 10% against the dollar since March. That makes the ECB’s job of boosting inflation harder by driving down import prices. Lane, the institution’s chief economist, said this month that the exchange rate “does matter” for monetary policy.
The president is likely to be quizzed in her press conference on how long the ECB expects to use its pandemic bond-buying program, and whether it’ll be increased. Some officials have stressed the importance of limiting its duration.
The program is currently scheduled to run through June next year. Most economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect an announcement by December to add 350 billion euros and extend it by six months.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York is facing a glut of workspace as fear of COVID-19 has reduced the daily usage of office buildings to almost nothing, a devastating sign for a city already reeling from the highest unemployment rate among the largest U.S. cities.
Manhattan's density and sea of skyscrapers together hamper a return to the office on the island and that is unlikely to change until a vaccine allows the subway and elevators in office towers to run at full capacity.
Just 8% of employees have returned to Manhattan offices as of mid-August, the Partnership for New York City, a non-profit of nearly 300 chief executives, found in a survey of major city employers. The real estate industry is the most aggressive in returning, with 53% already back, the partnership said. 
""The economy and people's sense of their health go in lock step,"" said Michael Cohen, president of the tri-state area at brokerage Colliers International Group Inc (TO:CIGI). 
""Until people feel safe enough to go back to the office, you can stand on one leg and spit nickels – they're not going to revive this economy,"" he said.
An increase in subletting and short-term lease renewals to more than 70% of deals shows management is uncertain about a company's real estate needs after the success of working remotely.
Subletting now makes up more than 25% of space availability in two of Manhattan's three submarkets, a level where supply outstrips demand, and at 23% for the island's entire market, is at the highest level since 2010, Colliers said. 
Average asking rents continued to climb to records in the first quarter when they peaked in Manhattan, and have since declined $2.03 per square foot to $78.01 in August.
Signs of increased subletting and its pressure on prices appeared relatively late compared to past recessions because brokers could not show clients office space until late July.
Leasing activity in August was almost 64% lower than the average monthly volume of 3.58 million square feet last year, according to Colliers.
""It's no surprise that many tenants are seeking short-term lease extensions and are hesitant to make any long-term commitments towards their office space needs,"" said Craig Bender, head of commercial real estate Americas at ING. 
""This situation is going to persist until there is a clear path forward beyond the pandemic,"" he said.
The downturn is not unique to New York and can be seen in the price of real estate investment trusts (REITs) that invest in East and West Coast office buildings. While the stock market has climbed more than 55% from the depths of the sell-off in March, the share price of office REITs have basically flatlined.
The market capitalization of office REITs that invest in mostly large coastal U.S. cities is about half what it was in mid-February when concerns about a coronavirus-induced recession drove investors to dump equities across the board.
The value that companies put on their office space is lower than it used to be,"" said Scott Crowe, chief investment strategist at CenterSquare Investment Management in Philadelphia.
Cohen, like other executives involved in commercial real estate, doubts working remotely will become predominant as people will want to be near the boss as they look to step up the corporate ladder.
""I do not subscribe to this idea that we're all going to be working remote forever because what's going to happen is competitive forces both internal and external will force us back into the office,"" he said.
However, Crowe acknowledged the office sector is in flux and is being priced in the REIT market ""almost like it's the next mall. Like it's obsolete,"" he said. ""New York is probably one of the worst real estate markets in the country right now.""

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Revenue shortfalls in India, the major economy hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, are likely to force the government to borrow more, but it will only consider monetising its deficit as a last resort, sources familiar with discussions told Reuters.
Borrowing plans for the second half of the financial year, ending on March 31, will be reviewed by government and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) officials later this month, the five sources said.
The officials have already discussed the possibility of monetising the debt, whereby the central bank prints money to bridge the fiscal deficit, but they were in no hurry to return to a bad habit India kicked in 1997.
""There will definitely be higher borrowing in the current year but whether we will print money, that is not yet decided. We will have to have patience and see how things go,"" a senior official said.
A senior government official said debt monetization was ""not the preferred option right now.""
""We have seen what some of the countries have done in this regard, but we think that such a move would be the last resort for us,"" the official added.
Aside from potentially harming India's credit rating, monetisation carries inflation risks that would be politically worrying in a country where voters are extremely sensitive to changes in food prices. 
The senior government official said the central bank could ease liquidity through open market operations to keep yields in check while helping the government to increase borrowing, already targeted at a record 12 trillion rupees ($163 billion).
RBI has pumped in over 11 trillion rupees of liquidity into the market, helping to keep 10-year bond yields below 6% even as the government decided to borrow 70% more than last year as a result of the pandemic.
Despite being under one of the strictest lockdowns for over four months India currently has the second highest number of coronavirus cases globally with economic activity curtailed and government revenues severely affected.
India's GDP contracted 23.9% on year in the April-June quarter, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) now projecting a full-year contraction of 14.8%.
Officials, however, are still pinning some hopes on raising revenue from the sale of the state-owned firms even though they do not expect to meet the target of over 2 trillion rupees for divestment sales this year. 

""The dilemma over deficit monetisation is not unique to India,"" said Radhika Rao, economist with DBS. ""The primary challenge is to communicate and ensure that this is a one-off pandemic-induced arrangement and not a recurrent financing line.""

578,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 10, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday, September 10th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The European Central Bank meets, under growing pressure to stop the euro's rise against the dollar. U.S. weekly jobless claims are due, as is a vote in the GOP-controlled Senate on a slimmed-down package of stimulus measures. Stocks are in a holding pattern after Wednesday's bounce, but China's are selling off as the regulator clamps down on speculation. Oil prices are falling again after U.S. inventory data fanned fears of a shortfall in demand. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, September 10th.
1. ECB to react to EUR strength
The European Central Bank meets for the first time since the Federal Reserve changed its monetary policy doctrine to essentially increase its inflation tolerance. The dollar has weakened since then, pushing the EUR/USD up to its highest in over two years, with many analysts forecasting a further run up to $1.25 in the coming months.
The Financial Times reported on Thursday that President Christine Lagarde will include a sentence on the exchange rate in the introductory statement at her press conference at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), prompting speculation that she will try to talk the euro down.
Whether she succeeds in that may depend on how her words fit the ECB’s new forecasts for growth and inflation. The ECB already expects to undershoot its CPI target through 2022, and any downward revision to that forecast will be tantamount to admitting that more stimulus is necessary, even though the final Q2 GDP reading suggested the Eurozone economy shrank by less than first thought.  
2. Jobless claims to show further drop
In the U.S., the weekly jobless claims data will be released at 8:30 AM ET. These have had a diminishing impact on financial markets in recent weeks, with little change evident in the narrative of a slowly recovering labor market.
Wednesday’s job openings survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics pointed to a much bigger rise in vacancies than expected, which suggests there is room for a positive surprise. Consensus forecasts expect initial claims to have fallen to 848,000 from 881,000 last week, while continuing claims – which come with a one-week lag – are expected to have fallen to 12.925 million from 13.354 million.
As always, it will be important to look beyond those headlines to the total number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits, which stuck above 29 million in last week’s report.
3. Stocks set to open lower; Senate stimulus bill eyed
U.S. stocks are set to open lower, as the pace of selling picks up again in the wake of Wednesday’s bounce. 
By 6:35 AM ET (1035 GMT), the Dow 30 futures contract was down 160 points or 0.6% and S&P 500 Futures were down by slightly less.
NASDAQ Futures, where volatility has been highest in recent sessions, were down 0.5%.
In addition to the jobless claims numbers, there will be producer price inflation data for August, along with earnings reports after the closing bell from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), exercise bike maker Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) and pet food group Chewy (NYSE:CHWY).
Participants will also keep one eye on the Senate’s vote on a slimmed-down stimulus package.
4. China’s regulator steps in to stop retail speculation
China’s tech stocks, which have also enjoyed a retail-investor-driven rally during the summer, continued to slide after the Securities Regulatory Commission moved to limit ‘speculative’ trading.
The Chinext index, where many of the country’s hottest startups are listed, fell another 1.6% and is now down 10% from the start of the month.
More than 300 start-ups dropped more than 10% on Thursday, including 50 companies hitting their downside trading limits, Reuters reported.
Korea’s KOSDAQ index, by contrast, surged another 1.7% to a fresh all-time high on perceptions that its companies will be among the biggest beneficiaries of U.S. moves to exclude Huawei from global telecoms infrastructure.
5. Oil slumps again after inventory data
Oil prices gave up Wednesday’s gains on nagging worries about global oversupply or, more accurately, a shortfall of demand as the world economy struggles to get back to pre-pandemic levels of activity.
The mood was soured by the American Petroleum Institute’s weekly report that showed U.S. crude inventories rose by nearly 3 million barrels last week, instead of falling as expected. The government’s data are due at 10:30 AM ET.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 1.5% at $37.47 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 1.2% at $40.30 a barrel.

579,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: BOJ to offer brighter view on economy as COVID crisis eases: sources,"By Leika Kihara and Takahiko Wada
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is expected to offer a brighter view next week on the economy, output and exports than in July to signal that they are starting to recover from the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic, sources familiar with its thinking said.
The optimism would back up the government's view that its massive stimulus has helped cushion the blow from COVID-19, at a time when its top spokesman Yoshihide Suga is eyeing a landslide victory in a ruling party election to become next prime minister.
But the BOJ will warn at its policy review that any recovery will be modest and bound with uncertainty, as fears over a renewed spike in infections and fragile global demand weigh on household and corporate spending, the sources said.
""It's clear the economy is bouncing back from a severe downturn in April-June, which was blamed largely on lock-down measures to contain the pandemic,"" one of the sources said, a view echoed by two other sources.
""But it's hard to judge at this stage how strong the recovery will be, with risks skewed toward the downside,"" the source said, a view echoed by two other sources.
The BOJ is set to keep monetary policy steady at the rate review, after having ramped up stimulus twice this year to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic.
On the current state of the economy, the central bank is likely to say that while conditions remain severe, there are some signs of a pick-up, according to the sources.
The view would be more upbeat than the assessment made in the BOJ's previous meeting in July, when it said the economy remained in an ""extremely severe state.""
The central bank is also expected to describe exports and output as recovering, compared with the July assessment that they were ""falling sharply,"" the sources said.
But the BOJ will point to various risks clouding the outlook, notably the chance a prolonged battle with COVID-19 could prod companies to slash capital expenditure, they said.
Pessimists in the bank also fret that consumption could take a hit later this year if companies start to shed jobs and cut bonus payments to make up for weak sales, the sources said.
BOJ Deputy Governor Masazumi Wakatabe warned of such risks in a speech last week, saying that households and firms may become more cautious about spending if the pandemic persists.
""There's a chance such temporary external shocks could lead to persistent economic stagnation,"" he said.
Japan suffered its worst postwar economic contraction in the second quarter as COVID-19 hit businesses, highlighting the challenges the new premier faces in averting a deeper recession.
Analysts expect growth to rebound modestly in the current quarter thanks to a pick-up in global auto demand that helped lift exports and output.
But prospects for consumption remain patchy with robust spending on durable goods offset by soft demand for services such as tourism, entertainment and dine-outs.
Analysts polled by Reuters in August said they expect the world's third-largest economy to shrink 5.6% in the current fiscal year to next March, and grow just 3.3% the following year.[ECILT/JP]
Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said last month that activity may not return to pre-crisis levels until early 2022.
As the pandemic ravaged the economy, the BOJ boosted buying of corporate debt and created a lending facility to channel money to smaller firms in a string of measures taken from March through May.
While those moves were described as temporary steps, many BOJ officials say they are ready to extend the current March 2021 deadline if the pain from the health crisis persists.

580,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2020 05:15AM ET</span>",Fear and poverty in Turkey as pandemic hits Erdogan's base,"By Jonathan Spicer and Ali Kucukgocmen
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Huseyin Goksoy, a tailor who was so stressed about going hungry during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic that he was briefly bedridden with a hernia, is increasingly worried about his future as Turkey strains to curb poverty. 
He is not alone.
Though a two-month lockdown ended in June, about four million Turks still rely on state aid to get by, while even more informal workers missed out on most of the financial support. 
Polls and academic research paint a grim picture ahead of the day when President Tayyip Erdogan's government is expected to lift a temporary ban on layoffs, possibly as soon as November. 
Goksoy, 48, makes face masks to help cover losses from earlier this year when he could not get a subsidized small-business loan because there was no guarantor in his conservative neighborhood in central Istanbul. 
""People don't get dressed up when they don't work, so I only repaired tears and it was 5-10 liras ($1) a day - if that,"" he said. ""I still can't send money to my kids when they want it. If I do a bad job, I'd go hungry.""
Data and polls show that fear and disillusionment like this are unprecedented across the labor market. Those hardest hit are the same Turks who benefited from years of Erdogan's welfare policies that helped to sharply reduce income inequalities. 
One study by Turkish economists Ayse Aylin Bayar, Oner Guncavdi and Haluk Levent predicts the number of impoverished Turks could double this year to nearly 20 million, and set back by two decades progress in narrowing inequality. 
That would effectively wipe out the successes of Erdogan's Islamist-rooted AK Party (AKP) and could test his staunchest voter base at the next general election set for 2023. 
Goksoy - whose shop is near the president's childhood home - said he still supported AKP though he would change his mind if he thought the party was no longer honest.
UNSUSTAINABLE 
Erdogan said on Monday the economy would emerge stronger from the pandemic even though its effects linger, adding that the government's 100 billion lira ($13 billion) aid program helped lower-income households.
Representatives of the presidency and the finance ministry, which administers the aid, did not immediately respond to questions about rising poverty. 
The aid scheme partially covers wages of many registered workers and funded some 2 million needy households. Big cities run by the main opposition party chipped in other funds and food supplies. 
But Turkey's mix of low-skilled labor in which a third of workers informally earn cash daily, a private sector dominated by small businesses and public finances already strained from a 2018-2019 recession leaves the country uniquely vulnerable.
Reserves at the central bank, which backstopped much of the pandemic response, have fallen sharply and accelerated a plunge in the Turkish lira to all-time lows. That in turn raises prices for basic imported goods.
By law, Erdogan can extend the ban on layoffs beyond November to mid-2021 to shield workers, but at a fiscal cost. 
""These are not sustainable policies,"" said Guncavdi, an economist at Istanbul Technical University who co-authored the study predicting a jump in poverty. 
""When they are removed, there is potential for upheaval with mass layoffs, a spike in destitution, family structures being tested and potential demonizing of minorities and refugees.""
Turkey's 3.6 million Syrian refugees faced backlash in past downturns, and those left unemployed this year had little safety net.
Retired florist Kemal Erdogan, 76, said this week he supports AKP but added that with the poor now getting poorer it was clear Turkey welcomed too many foreigners who are ""living better lives than you and I"".
LOCKDOWN ANXIETIES
An unprecedented collapse in employment endured after the lockdown was lifted in June and July, driven by workers not formally on payrolls, government data showed on Thursday. 
A record 1.4 million were too discouraged to search for work, up nearly threefold from a year ago. Of those who had jobs last month, nearly half were ""very afraid"" of losing them by winter, a poll by Istanbul Economics Research found.
Can Selcuki, general manager of the consultancy, said that likely reflects workers' suspicion that they will be laid off ""the minute"" the layoff ban is lifted. He added that support for Erdogan's ruling alliance dipped to 44% in a poll this month, from 46% in August after a summer bounce.
Turkey, like several other countries, banned layoffs in April when it also closed most businesses, shut borders and intercity travel and adopted partial stay-at-home orders. 
Large gatherings were curbed, leaving Mehmet Coskun, a wedding drummer without social security, only a third of his usual gigs. ""I don't know what to do when my loan payments come along,"" he said. ""Perhaps I can sell water or clean buildings.""
Such lost jobs in the service, tourism and construction sectors are hurting Turkey's poorest households the most, according to the World Bank. The bank, however, predicts that the poverty rate will rise less than forecast in the Turkish study, to about 12% from 10%, contained in part by the state aid.
A recent rise in coronavirus cases to early May levels only raises anxieties.
Meryem Yildirim, who opened a women's clothing shop in Istanbul two months ago, said a return to lockdown was her worst nightmare.
""All small businesses think this way now,"" said the mother of two, adding she took out a loan to pay rent and to cover a second loan on the shop.

581,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2020 03:16AM ET</span>",ECB to take aim at strong euro with hints of more stimulus,"By Balazs Koranyi
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is all but certain to keep policy unchanged on Thursday but with the economic recovery losing momentum and a strong euro dampening already-anaemic inflation expectations, it may set the stage for more stimulus later. 
Having pulled out the stops this spring to halt a historic economic decline across the 19-country currency bloc, the ECB has time to let governments implement their own countermeasures and for its own ultra-easy policy to seep into the real economy. 
But hurdles to the rebound from a 12% output drop in the second quarter are proving bigger than expected, and economists say the ECB will eventually be forced into taking more action, possibly as soon as December. 
Surveys indicate that a recent resurgence in coronavirus infections is sapping investor and consumer confidence, with many fearing fresh restrictions on ordinary life.
But more importantly for the ECB, inflation has turned negative, raising the risk that longer term price growth expectations also take a hit, leading to a hard-to-reverse downward spiral.
This is crucial for the ECB, which has undershot its nearly 2% inflation target for the past seven years, casting doubt on the credibility of a policy that is radical, yet fails to achieve its objective.
Compounding ECB's problem, the euro has firmed 8% against the dollar since the spring and more than 4% against a basket of currencies weighted by the bloc's foreign trade. In early trade on Thursday, the euro was trading at 1.1830 against the dollar, not far below a psychologically important 1.20 level.
TRICKS
All this leaves ECB President Christine Lagarde with a complicated communications exercise. She cannot target the exchange rate but also cannot just ignore the euro's rapid rise. 
""Ms. Lagarde will need to walk a tightrope, probably hinting that the ECB is monitoring the implications of euro appreciation for price stability, and that all tools can be adjusted as needed to meet the inflation mandate,"" UniCredit said in a note.
""That said, we doubt that her rhetoric will be sufficiently bold to trigger a trend reversal in the euro.""
Guiding the currency is always risky, however, and four ECB board members, including Lagarde and chief economist Philip Lane are lined up to speak in the 24 hours after the meeting, suggesting that the ECB is preparing to fine-tune its message if markets react poorly. 
""We argue that the ECB lacks effective options to respond to the euro's appreciation,"" BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) said in a note to clients. ""Instead, verbal pushback on the exchange rate is likely to continue, coupled with a more balanced, but overall still cautious tone on the economy."" 
Compounding this headache is the U.S. Federal Reserve's tweak last month to its own inflation target, suggesting that it will raise rates later than in the past, which could put downward pressure on the dollar. 
A stronger euro cuts into the competitiveness of euro zone exporters and dampens inflation through cheaper imports, a headache as inflation is already too low.
The ECB will also update its economic forecasts on Thursday, but board member Isabel Schnabel has already said that the economy is performing in line with the ECB's expectations so only small changes are likely.
Once it is time to turn words into action, the ECB is likely to keep relying on its 1.35 trillion euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase programme to hoover up even more debt to keep euro zone governments' borrowing costs down. 
While some policymakers argue that the scheme needs to be wound down once the actual crisis is over, bond issuance is expected to spike next year, meaning any hint that the ECB will step back from the market risks pushing yields higher. 

The ECB announces its policy decision at 1145 GMT, which is then followed by Lagarde's news conference at 1230 GMT.

582,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2020 02:51AM ET</span>","Wild weather this year shows growing impact of climate change, scientists say","By Matthew Green
LONDON (Reuters) - The planet is showing signs it's in peril. In recent weeks, the world has seen ferocious wildfires in the U.S. West, torrential rains in Africa, weirdly warm temperatures on the surface of tropical oceans, and record heat waves from California to the Siberian Arctic.
This spate of wild weather is consistent with climate change, scientists say, and the world can expect even more extreme weather and higher risks from natural disasters as global emissions of greenhouse gases continue.
""We are seeing the emergence of some signals that would have had almost no chance of happening without human-induced climate change,"" said Sonia Seneviratne, a climate scientist at Swiss university ETH Zurich.
For decades, scientists have warned of such events – but have been wary of saying that a particular storm or heat wave was a direct result of climate change. That's now changing.
Advances in a relatively new field known as ""event attribution science"" have enabled researchers to assess how big a role climate change might have played in a specific case.
In determining that link, scientists assess simulations of how weather systems might behave if humans had never started pumping carbon dioxide into the air, and compare that with what is happening today. They also factor in weather observations made over the last century or more.
""What seemed like an established truth that you cannot attribute a particular extreme weather event to climate change is less and less true,"" Seneviratne told Reuters.
FEELING THE HEAT
The clearest examples are found in the growing frequency and intensity of heat waves worldwide. 
Scientists needed only days to identify climate change as the key culprit in this year's record temperatures in Siberia, with extreme heat drying out forests and peat across the Russian tundra, leading to massive wildfires.
Climate change links have also been found in the simultaneous summer heat waves that hit Europe, Japan and North America in 2018. Studies found that the chances of these events happening together would have been near zero without the industrial-era rise in planet-warming carbon emissions.
""When it comes to heat waves, we see that climate change is an absolute game-changer,"" said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford who has helped to pioneer the field of attribution science. 
As a heat wave hit the U.S. West Coast last month, Earth saw a new record high temperature of 54.4 Celsius (130 Fahrenheit) in Death Valley, which sits below sea level in California's Mojave Desert. Weeks later, the region was still broiling, with the mercury soaring Sunday to a new record of 49C for nearby Los Angeles County. 
""It's not so much that climate change is destabilising historical weather patterns,"" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California. ""In many cases, it's amplifying them.""
Hotter temperatures in turn sap the air of humidity and dry out forest and brush on land, creating perfect conditions for wildfires. In California, ""the fires that we're seeing are larger, and faster moving, and more intense than those you could have expected historically,"" Swain said.
But attribution science has not explained everything. For example, researchers do not yet fully understand Europe's heat waves.
""In Western Europe, the increase in heat waves is much stronger than the models predict, and we have no clue why,"" said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, an attribution science expert at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.
WIND, RAIN AND FLOODS
As average global temperatures have risen by about 1C since pre-industrial times, changes in the atmosphere and oceans are also leading to more intense storms.
Hurricanes overall are getting stronger and spinning slower, as they pick up energy from the heat in the oceans. Researchers at the University of Bristol in the west of England published a study last month that found that climate change could make extreme hurricane rainfall in the Caribbean five times more likely, without rapid cuts in emissions.
In the United States, warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico boosted Hurricane Laura to a category 4 storm in the last hours before it slammed into Louisiana with 150 mile-per-hour (240 kph) winds. Governor John Bel Edwards described it as the most powerful hurricane to strike the state, surpassing even Katrina in 2005.
Tropical cyclones spinning out from the Indian Ocean are showing similar patterns. The region has long been considered a hot spot for cyclones, with some of the deadliest storms in recent history churning through the Bay of Bengal before slamming into India or Bangladesh.
Exceptionally high surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean, associated with climate change, helped Cyclone Amphan grow into a Category 5 storm in a record 18 hours before it tore into the Indian state of West Bengal in May, scientists say. 
The following month, Cyclone Nisarga, initially forecast to be the first to batter Mumbai since 1948, made landfall 100 km (65 miles) south of the city, with winds gusting up to 120 kph (75 mph).
""Both of the cyclones were unprecedented,"" said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. ""If we go back to what led to these kinds of extreme events, what we see is that very warm ocean temperatures have played a major role.""
Those warm ocean temperatures are also likely contributing to extreme rainfall and flooding in China, which this summer suffered its most punishing flood season in three decades.
""The extreme rainfall events are going to become more extreme. That is something we feel pretty confident about,"" said Shang-Ping Xie, a climate scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California. 
Africa is feeling this now, following torrential rains and severe flooding. Tens of thousands have been left homeless by flooding from the Nile in Sudan. And in Senegal, more rain fell on a single day on Saturday than the country would usually see during three months of the rainy season, the government said.

""There's a large and growing body of evidence that is telling us that human-caused climate change is affecting extreme events,"" said James Kossin, a climate scientist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""It's very rare that this is happening in a helpful way.""

583,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>",WTO leadership race seen as hostage to U.S. election,"By Emma Farge and Philip Blenkinsop
GENEVA/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization's effort to select a leader entered a new stage this week as ambassadors from 164 member countries met with senior officials for private ‘confessionals’ to say who they support.
But the politicking in Geneva, the first in a three-stage elimination process, could be a wasted effort according to six former WTO officials and trade experts. They say the decisive developments that will shape the future of the embattled global organization are unfolding thousands of miles away in Washington.
The U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3 is overshadowing the WTO's efforts to fill the gap left by Roberto Azevedo since he stepped down as director-general on Aug. 31 and it could end up thwarting the WTO's aim of filling the vacant top spot within the prescribed two months.
The United States' support for a particular candidate is critical but four trade experts including former WTO employees believe the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is unlikely to throw a lifeline to a multilateral body the president has threatened to leave, particularly during an election campaign in which trade is a hot button issue.
Trump has launched a trade war with China, imposed tariffs on U.S. allies and crushed the WTO's ability to intervene in disputes – a key part of its raison d'etre -- by blocking the appointment of members to its Appellate Body.
""I find it hard to imagine that the Trump administration would shift tack and do something very positive for the system,"" said David Tinline, a former adviser to Azevedo.
The White House referred questions to the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) office. The USTR declined to comment, and referred Reuters to remarks made by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to U.S. lawmakers in June, in which he said the WTO needed a reform-driven leader and that he would veto any candidate who showed ""any whiff of anti-Americanism"". 
The U.S.-China economic conflict is a further complicating factor. Any candidate backed by the United States could be automatically rejected by Beijing and vice versa, former WTO officials and trade experts say.
In a statement, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it would participate constructively in the selection process. 
""We are willing to work closely with all parties to elect a good director-general through full consultation, ensure a smooth handover and push the WTO to play a greater role in global economic governance,"" the ministry said.
THE BIDEN FACTOR
Azevedo's departure has left a void at the WTO amid worsening U.S.-China relations and as the coronavirus crisis accelerates protectionism and pulverises the global economy.
There are currently eight candidates in contention and they will be winnowed down to five after the first 'confessional' meetings conclude on Sept. 16. The field will then be cut to two, with the winner due to be confirmed by a Nov. 7 deadline.
Many delegates perceive the main frontrunners as being two women from Africa, Nigeria's Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and Kenya's Amina Mohamed. Either would be the body's first female leader. 
For a Factbox on candidates click here:
The final decision is designed to be taken by consensus. The alternative, a vote, has never occurred and is described under WTO rules as a ""last resort"". So, it is possible but unlikely it would anoint a new director-general without a nod from its largest paymaster, America.
Choosing a leader can be a messy process at the WTO. In 1999, countries were so evenly split that the selection took a year, creating acrimony and distracting from a global trade round which ultimately failed.
Britain's former trade secretary Liam Fox, whom Lighthizer has described as ""one of the favorites"" to win the leadership race, was upbeat on Washington's role in the selection process.
""I don't think there is the hostility there that is sometimes mooted,"" he said of the current administration, describing a ""strong reservoir of support for free trade and the multilateral rules-based system"" in both U.S. political parties. 
If a favourite candidate does not emerge, some WTO members might prefer to wait until after the U.S. election in case Joe Biden, Trump's Democratic challenger, wins.
""They could play a waiting game, but that would push the decision until at least February or March,"" said Peter van den Bossche, a former member of the now crippled WTO body that adjudicated on trade disputes.
Biden has said the United States needs to reduce its reliance on China but he is seen as a more WTO-friendly leader having emphasised a multilateral approach to dealing with trade issues and criticising Trump’s tariffs.
No WTO member has publicly acknowledged plans for a calculated delay although two delegates privately said it would be preferable if the U.S. election winner weighs in. WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell said there were no indications of an extension to the selection process.
The WTO has already been through two months of lobbying by candidates, with COVID-19 restrictions meaning normally large hotel receptions laid on by candidates' home countries have been replaced by lower-key functions. Nigeria's Okonjo-Iweala did much of her canvassing online while quarantining.
Even though the WTO is member-led, a strong leader who can faciliate decision-making is seen as crucial, particularly with global trade under attack on many fronts.
This year alone, compromise will be needed to conclude negotiations to reduce tens of billions of dollars in fishing subsidies.
Then there is the budget. Last year, it snuck through after Azevedo assuaged U.S. concerns that the WTO was overspending. These are expected to resurface this year.

""You need a good person, but this is not about a superman or superwoman to save the multilateral system,"" said van den Bossche.

584,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2020 01:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Mexico may extend relaxed bank credit rules to help economy grow,"By Stefanie Eschenbacher and Abraham Gonzalez
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's finance ministry is considering extending relaxed banking credit rules to help its battered economy recover, a top official said on Wednesday, after it presented an austere 2021 budget that leaves little room to maneuver.
Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio said the ministry was in talks with the banking industry and the central bank about the possible extension until next year of the temporary measures designed to avoid defaults and loss of collateral. 
The measures were introduced earlier this year as part of the government's strategy to reduce the impact of the coronavirus containment in the country, which is still scarred by memories of the 1995 ""Tequila crisis,"" when Mexicans lost homes and savings. 
Yorio said he hoped an extension could be announced within a ""couple of weeks,"" while suggesting the facilities could be restricted to certain sectors of the economy to limit risks to the financial system.
Earlier this year, the finance ministry and the central bank agreed to loosen credit quality restrictions for banks. In turn, banks were able to offer borrowers repayment options so as to avoid defaults.
""What we have to do, maybe, is be selective with the sectors,"" Yorio said.
Industries that had already reopened and potentially had better cash flow might be excluded, he said, to focus resources on others, such as airlines, that would face a slow recovery.
On Tuesday the government unveiled a lean budget that aims to reduce the country's debt as a proportion of GDP in 2021 even as it struggles with high coronavirus infections and a slow economic recovery.
Speaking in an interview at the National Palace a day after the budget, Yorio acknowledged that it could take two to three years for Mexico's economy to reach its pre-pandemic size.
""If the economic opening is delayed, it might take us even more time,"" he said, adding that the recovery was a concern for credit ratings agencies which have Mexico on a negative outlook. 
Ratings agencies have Mexico's bonds still several notches above speculative grade, or junk. But investors increasingly worry that they will eventually follow those of state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos in its descent into junk. 
""They all measure the credit risk...that's why it is important to maintain stable debt,"" Yorio said. 
""But the second most important variable is in terms of growth,"" he said, adding that the risk of a downgrade was one of the main worries in the ministry.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has been an outlier among both wealthy and emerging nations, insisting on tight spending limits even as the economy fell in the deepest recession since the 1930s Great Depression.
Latin America's second-largest economy was already in a mild recession before the pandemic.
The room for economic stimulus from budget measures was constrained in a country that collects just 15% of GDP in tax, Yorio said, hence the need to turn to the financial system to support growth. 
""Not all measures have to come from the budget,"" he said.

The request from Ng, a Malaysian national, comes days after prosecutors dropped criminal charges against Goldman Sachs following a deal which would see the U.S. investment bank pay $3.9 billion to the Malaysian government. 
Ng's lawyer Tan Hock Chuan told a Kuala Lumpur court he had applied to the country's attorney-general to have four charges against his client lessened or dropped. 
""On the instructions of my client, we have sent a letter of representation to the A-G to review the charges against him,"" he told reporters after the hearing.
The court proceedings will continue on Nov. 20. 
Ng is currently in the United States, where he has been charged for conspiring to launder money and bribe government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi through bond offerings that Goldman Sachs had handled. 
Under an extradition deal, Ng will be returned to Malaysia after the completion of his trial in New York, which is due to begin next year.
Ng has pleaded not guilty to the charges in both countries.

The U.S. Department of Justice estimates $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped raise. The bank has consistently denied wrongdoing.

586,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 11:40PM ET</span>",Reform hopes rise as China focuses on inward economic shift,"By Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese reform advocates are hoping President Xi Jinping's proposed new economic model, expected to be the centrepiece of a key conclave next month, is an opportunity to quicken changes to spur domestic demand and tackle structural woes.
The new development model will be discussed at a meeting of the ruling Communist Party in October, where policies are expected to be built into the next five-year road-map for the economy, policy insiders said. 
Xi in May proposed a ""dual circulation"" strategy for the next phase of economic development in which China will rely mainly on ""domestic circulation"" - an internal cycle of production, distribution and consumption.
That will be supported by ""international circulation"", in which China further integrates with the global economy, opening its doors to more foreign goods, capital and investment. 
As tensions between Washington and Beijing rise, the potential decoupling of the world's two largest economies presents significant risks, a prospect that is firming China's resolve to shift reliance to its own vast domestic market, policy insiders said.
The gathering of the Central Committee, the largest of the Communist Party's elite decision-making bodies, will focus on the 2021-2025 plan for the country's social and economic development. It will be the 14th such plan since China embarked on rapid industrialisation under its first five-year plan in 1953-1957. 
""It (dual circulation) will be a pivot of the 14th five-year plan. There will definitely be difficulties to make it work,"" said a policy insider. 
Guided by the new strategy, elements of the 2016-2020 plan, including supply-side reforms and policies to spur urbanisation and innovation, are expected to be taken to the next level, the details of which will be unveiled at the annual parliamentary session next year. 
Few details have been published on the scheme itself, but economists and think tanks are proposing various reforms that they deem crucial to steering a more self-reliant economic course and building long-term growth drivers, they said.
China's State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. 
Government advisers have called for faster reform of China's land and residency systems - key obstacles to its goal of building a highly urbanised, consumer-driven economy - and tackling a yawning rich-poor gap that has weighed on spending.
Overhauling giant state companies would help tackle deep-rooted economic distortions and help level the playing field for struggling private firms, they argued.
""Domestic circulation won't take off if we cannot do a good job on reforms,"" said a government adviser who declined to be identified.
At a meeting with Chinese economists on Aug. 24, Xi pledged to take more measures to break down ""deep-seated institutional barriers"", and reaffirmed a longstanding pledge to let markets play a decisive role in resource allocation.
In April, China's cabinet issued guidelines on improving market-based allocation of ""production factors"", including land, labour, technology and capital, in a bid to deepen market-oriented reforms. 
To be sure, rebalancing the economy to rely more on consumer spending and less on inefficient investment and volatile exports has been a key policy goal for the past decade.
But many Chinese advisers and economists are disappointed over the pace of reform in recent years, as a stability-obsessed government has plucked lower hanging fruit and delayed more painful reforms first unveiled at a key party meeting in 2013.
Increased control by the ruling Communist Party over all aspects of society has raised doubts about faster changes. 
""If we want to rely on domestic circulation, we must push reforms to unleash growth potentials,"" said Jia Kang, head of China Academy of New Supply-side Economics, a think tank.
'MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP'
The stakes are high. 
Three decades ago, China took advantage of its abundant cheap labor, importing parts and components before re-exporting finished products. In recent years, it has pivoted towards consumption-led growth. 
Last year, total exports and imports accounted for 32% of gross domestic product (GDP), down from a peak of 64% in 2006. Consumption as a share of GDP climbed to 55.4% last year from 49.3% in 2010, but was still far lower than 70-80% in developed economies. 
While rebalancing has gained some traction, economists said further transformation is needed to help China evade the so-called ""middle-income trap"", a situation where an economy stagnates at middle-income levels. 
The main obstacles are growing competition from countries with advanced technologies, as well as economies with lower labour costs. 
China's economy has to grow 5% annually in the next five years to help it become a high-income nation, policy insiders said. 
But growth this year, pummeled by the coronavirus crisis, is likely to slow to its weakest pace since 1976 - the final year of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution. [ECILT/CN]
""The next five years will be a crucial period for bypassing the 'middle income trap',"" said Xu Hongcai, deputy director of economic policy commission at China Association of Policy Science. 

""As a big country, it's not realistic to rely on external demand, and we should strengthen stability of domestic supply chains and push transformation to move up the value chain.""

BUENOS AIRES/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's pick to run Latin America's main financing institution appears poised to win the top job in this weekend's election amid faltering regional opposition to having a U.S. citizen run the bank for first time in 61 years.
Mauricio Claver-Carone, Trump's senior Latin America adviser known for his hardline stance on Venezuela and Cuba, has majority support to head the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). But a group of countries, including Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Costa Rica, had appeared close to having the 25% vote needed to block the election.
Some countries that had opposed Claver-Carone's candidacy now privately concede they do not have the backing they had sought.
An Argentine Foreign Ministry official suggested plans to halt the vote were off the table because ""there are not enough willing"" member countries to block the U.S. candidate.
The IDB vote has become a geopolitical battle between the Trump administration, which is eager to gain leverage in resource-rich Latin American and counter the rise of China, and some in the region who do not want to lose control of the lender.
The IDB has been led by Latin Americans since its inception in 1959, while the World Bank has historically been led by a U.S. citizen.
Mexico, which was key to blocking the vote, has signaled it will not block the quorum needed to hold the election, a source familiar with the process said, adding: ""The election is all but decided.""
Asked about Mexico's position, a senior Trump administration official told Reuters: ""Mexico is our friend, neighbor and largest trading partner. We will always have a fluid dialogue across a broad range of issues.
""As regards the IDB specifically, we have asked all member countries to respect the democratic will of the majority for selection of the next president, regardless of their candidate preference,” the official said.
DELAY NO LONGER LIKELY
Former Mexico Foreign Secretary Jorge Castañeda wrote in an opinion column that Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had failed to galvanize opposition to Trump's nominee.
""Argentina could not block the election by itself; everything was in the hands of Mexico and (the president),"" Castañeda wrote. ""He chickened out.""
Mexican Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio told Reuters the country had been in favor of postponing the vote but that a delay no longer seemed likely.
""Mexico's position was to take some time to discuss this, but it seems that it will not happen. It seems that the vote will take place over the weekend,"" Yorio said in an interview.
The Latin American countries that called for a delay held around 22% of the bank's voting share - shy of the 25% needed to block a quorum on voting day. Argentine officials were hoping European countries would join their efforts and tip the balance.
Argentine Foreign Minister Felipe Sola told a local radio station this week that Europe failed to come through.
""We are going to ratify our position that the IDB cannot be led by a U.S. candidate and that it cannot fall prey to the competition between the U.S. and China,"" the Argentine Foreign Ministry official said. He added that Argentina's candidate for the IDB post had already been officially nominated.

The IDB was founded as a partnership between the United States and 19 Latin American countries and expanded over time to include nations around the globe.

The annual report of the European Chamber of Commerce in China also highlighted concerns about travel restrictions imposed on foreign workers because of the coronavirus pandemic and the exclusion of foreign businesses from key sectors of the economy.
""Companies are left navigating a political minefield during a health crisis of truly overwhelming proportions,"" chamber president Joerg Wuttke said in comments attached to the report, which draws on contributions from working groups, surveys and comments from its more than 1,700 members.
The report warned that the risk of deteriorating relations between China and Europe - over issues like Beijing's treatment of the Uighur Muslim minority and new national security legislation for Hong Kong - could seriously impact European companies doing business in China.
European companies now ""have even more reason to believe that they could become victims of arbitrary punishment"" due to their home country governments' actions against China, the report said.
The report cited China's imposition in May of a more than 80% tariff on Australian barley imports, effectively stopping a billion-dollar trade in a move widely viewed as linked to escalating political tensions between Canberra and Beijing.
Already inflamed by Australia's allegations that China was meddling in its domestic affairs, relations worsened when Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for an independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19.
Travel restrictions imposed amid the pandemic have also left many European company employees stranded outside of China, and discrimination against foreigners was ignored by Chinese officials, the said. 
""Chamber members cannot help wondering if these actions and inactions are indicative of a broader mindset that while foreign capital and technology are desired in China, foreigners themselves are not,"" it said.
The report also cites a continued lack of significant opening of China's market, with bureaucratic obstacles to full entry in sectors like banking and insurance, cutting off foreign companies from gaining market share. 
""Worryingly, there now seems to be a growing list of sectors that either restrict foreign investment, or in which support is provided to China's national champions to the extent that it squeezes out any potential European competition,"" it said. 
Renewables, telecoms, and other high-tech industries with strong growth potential are tightening up to foreign investors, the report said. 

China has sent both its foreign minister and top diplomat to Europe in recent weeks, in efforts to bolster ties amid increasing tensions with the United States.

589,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 05:27PM ET</span>",Pelosi Says U.K. Can Forget U.S. Trade Deal If Irish Pact Broken,"(Bloomberg) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the U.K. can forget about Congressional approval for a free-trade deal with the U.S. if Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union imperils an agreement that ended conflict in Northern Ireland.
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing a backlash from the EU and from within his own ruling Conservative Party after his government said it’s making plans to break its commitments to the bloc over the Irish border. Pelosi said that the U.K. must ensure the free flow of goods across the border, as agreed in Britain’s deal with the EU last year.
Last year’s accord gave Northern Ireland the same trade rules as the EU to avoid customs checks at the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, a key part of the Good Friday Agreement two decades go that ended years of bloodshed. A U.K. bill published on Wednesday would allow ministers to override parts of that accord.
“If the U.K. violates that international treaty and Brexit undermines the Good Friday accord, there will be absolutely no chance of a U.S.-U.K. trade agreement passing the Congress,” Pelosi, the nation’s top elected Democrat, said in a statement Wednesday.
In the U.S., while the power to negotiate trade deals is delegated to the president by Congress, agreements must later pass both chambers. Pelosi effectively controls the agenda in the lower house, where her party holds a majority, and used her leverage last year to hold up a new North American free-trade agreement to extract changes from Mexico. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and his U.K. counterpart began negotiations toward a trade deal in June.
The EU considers it has grounds for legal action against the U.K. over the plan, according to a document seen by Bloomberg. The EU judges it may have a case to seek legal remedies under the divorce agreement even before the U.K. internal-market bill is passed by Parliament and that it would have a clear justification once the bill becomes law, according to the EU’s preliminary analysis of the U.K. legislation.

Britain quit the EU in January but has remained part of its single market, largely free of trade barriers, under an agreement that expires in December. London says that if it cannot negotiate a favorable trade deal to take effect from Jan. 1, it will simply walk away.

OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada held its key overnight interest rate steady on Wednesday but left the door open on possible future changes to bond buying, while a 13-year high for Canadian housing starts added to evidence of economic recovery.
Canada's central bank said in a statement that the third-quarter rebound was looking to be faster than anticipated, though it noted that as the economy moves from the recovery to recuperation phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, it will continue to require extraordinary monetary policy support.
The Bank of Canada said it will continue its large-scale asset purchases at their current pace, but tweaked the language to say the program will be ""calibrated"" to provide the necessary stimulus needed to support the recovery. 
Analysts said this suggests the bank will tweak its quantitative (QE) program if more or less stimulus is needed, rather than make changes to interest rates.
""The new language is a bit more balanced but I don't think they're teeing up for an imminent change in asset purchases,"" said Josh Nye, senior economist at RBC Economics. 
""While the bank noted the early recovery has been stronger than expected, they tempered any enthusiasm by noting the recuperation phase is still likely to be 'slow and choppy,'"" he added. 
The Canadian dollar  was trading 0.6% higher at 1.3158 to the greenback, or 76.00 U.S. cents, with the loonie extending its recovery from an earlier three-week low at 1.3259 after the BoC announcement, as stocks and oil prices rose. [MKTS/GLOB] 
The central bank also noted that government programs to replace incomes and subsidize wages have been supporting economic activity.
Canada will this month start to transition people off its main COVID-19 emergency income support program and onto traditional unemployment benefits, which critics say will leave some Canadians with less money.
BoC Governor Tiff Macklem will give a speech on the uneven effects of COVID-19 on Thursday.
The central bank said that both the global and Canadian economies are evolving broadly in line with the scenario it set out in July, but noted a stronger than expected rebound in the United States, Canada's largest trading partner.
Analysts said the decision to keep rates at 0.25% and the statement were broadly in line with expectations. The BoC will next update its outlook for the economy in late October. 
""No changes to policy and no real surprises and we will just see what will happen in October,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities.
Canada's pace of housing starts, meanwhile, jumped to 262,396 units from 245,425 units in July, the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) said, easily beating analyst expectations of 220,000 units.
Analysts said some of the momentum is still catch-up from delays caused by COVID-19 and warned cracks could be coming.

""The fact that so much of the recent strength has been focused in the multi-unit sector presents a risk,"" said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Economics, in a note, noting housing demand from immigration and students has waned.

592,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>","New sanction threats, same shrugs from Russia's investors","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The West's push to impose sanctions on Russia over an alleged nerve agent attack on President Vladimir Putin's main political opponent is getting a familiar shrug of the shoulders from international investors, who view Moscow's finances as just too strong to be cracked.
November's U.S. election could be a game changer but, for now, money managers are drawing on experiences of the 2014 Ukraine crisis and 2018's Mueller report and Skripal spy poisonings, and not rushing to react to the latest tensions.
The consensus has long been that, as long as Washington or Europe don't impose the ultimate sanction and make it illegal to own Russian sovereign debt, new threats won't dent the appeal of decent 2% 'real' interest rates and one of strongest public balance sheets in the world.
Underpinned by its huge reserves of oil and gas, Russia's debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to be just 20% this year, less than a fifth of that of the United States, Britain or France and under a third of China's. 
Along with well over half a trillion dollars worth of reserves, a competent central bank and conservative fiscal policy, Mirabaud's head of emerging market debt, Daniel Moreno, says it makes Russia one of the strongest markets he looks at, and bulletproof to all but the worst-case sanctions. 
""What we know is that over the past six years since the events in the Ukraine happened, the U.S. and EU have been continually applying sanctions,"" Moreno said.
""The question is, are these sanctions having any desirable effect (for the West)? I think the answer is definitively 'no'.""
Graphic - Rouble, routs and reserves: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjpqygyjpx/Pasted%20image%201599518333986.png
It's not that sanctions - or the threat of sanctions - haven't triggered negative reactions. They have. 
For BlueBay Asset Management's Tim Ash, a growing list of situations where Moscow is under scrutiny has driven a mini- sell off in Russian assets.
""It is trading on the general Russia-Western relationship,"" Ash said. ""Alexei Navalny, U.S. elections, Nord Stream, Belarus, Syria, Georgia. There is a lot going on."" 
Talk of the EU abandoning the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline due to the Navalny case, tensions over Belarus' disputed election, combined with a fresh drop in oil prices and looming U.S. elections have knocked 5%-12% off Russia's rouble (RUBUSD=R), government bond   and equity markets (IMOEX) (IRTS) over the last few weeks.
It was similar in both 2014 and 2018 when international investors also cut their 'OFZ' government bond holdings. 
It's just that for investors with a medium or longer-term view, these kind of moves have always reversed -- Russian bonds earned more than 20% last year and equities 40% -- and even the reactions to new threats seem to have become smaller recently. 
JP Morgan data shows for example that its clients were more invested in Russian bonds -- 'overweight' in fund manager speak -- coming into the current events than at any time in at least the last 6 years.

REALPOLITIK VS REAL INTEREST RATES
High 'real' interest rates -- rates minus inflation -- along with Russia's other strong fundamentals have helped lure back investors. 
Foreigners owned a record 35% of the rouble-denominated OFZ bond market before COVID-19 and collapsing oil prices caused an exodus from emerging markets this year.
The country's share in JPMorgan’s GBI-EM index, the main global benchmark for emerging market local currency bonds, has also grown to 8.3% from nearer 7% a couple of years ago and just 1.5% in 2007.
It is still off the 10% index-maximum hit during the 2012-14 oil boom, though, and elsewhere it has lost ground. 
Having had its ability to issue new dollar-denominated debt limited by previous U.S. sanctions, Russia now comprises just 3.4% of JPM's ""hard currency"" EMBIG Diversified index compared to 9.0% in 2007.
The rise of big tech at the expense of oil firms has also seen it drop to 4.4% from 14% on the corporate debt equivalent, and to just 3.3% on MSCI’s emerging equity index, a benchmark for almost $2 trillion in cash.

Rating agency Fitch thinks the risk of further western sanctions on Russia ""remains high"", especially with U.S. election race hotting up. But it doesn't expect really crippling steps such as complete ban on owning Russian debt or its banks being cut off from the SWIFT global payment system.
""We have seen that the past sanctions sell-offs were always actually a good opportunity to get in,"" said Aberdeen Standard Investment portfolio manager Viktor Szabo. ""Russian assets came back with a vengeance.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The likelihood of Britain and the European Union failing to agree a trade deal by the end of the year has jumped in the past month as negotiations have all but stalled over fisheries and state aid, according to a Reuters poll on Wednesday.
Britain left the EU in January and a transition period is due to expire at the end of this year so the clock is ticking for the two sides to reach agreement on their future relationship.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said he will not ask for any extension, despite the economic havoc wrought by the coronavirus pandemic. On Wednesday, London threw Brexit talks into chaos by announcing draft legislation that explicitly acknowledges some of its provisions would break international law.
The bill, which the government said would break international law ""in a very specific and limited way"", has contributed to concerns that Britain could be forced to leave the EU single market with no agreement on trade.
According to the Sept. 7-9 Reuters poll, the chance that the two sides will fail to reach a deal has jumped to 40% from the 30% given in an August poll. The poll was taken before the announcement, suggesting the reading may now be higher, and the highest forecast was already 65%.
""The comfortable timetable, whereby a deal is agreed this month, signed off at the European Council in mid-October and then enshrined into law in Q4, looks in doubt,"" said Elizabeth Martins at HSBC.
""It may well be that there ends up being a less-than-comprehensive deal, or even no deal at all.""
But as in all Reuters polls since the June 2016 referendum decision to leave the EU, the latest survey said the most likely outcome was still some form of free trade agreement.
""As seen often in politics, when there's a will, there's a way,"" said Jordan Rochester at Nomura.
""If for some reason a deal is not reached in October but discussions were closing in on a solution, then politicians will likely find a way to rush a treaty through in December.""
BOUNCEBACK
Britain has suffered the largest death toll in Europe from the coronavirus pandemic, despite a lockdown that forced businesses to close and citizens to stay home to try to prevent contagion.
That shutdown meant the economy shrank a record 20.4% last quarter, from the previous quarter. But it is likely to expand 15.8% this quarter as some restrictions have been relaxed, according to the Reuters poll.
For all of 2020, the economy will contract 10.0% but expand 6.1% next year, according to the median poll returns, little changed from the respective -9.7% and +6.2% forecasts given last month.
To support the battered economy, the government has increased spending to record amounts while the Bank of England chopped its lending rate to a record low of 0.10% and restarted its asset purchase programme.
BoE chief economist Andy Haldane this week hailed the incipient recovery.
But fellow rate-setters Michael Saunders, Gertjan Vlieghe and Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden have expressed concern that the economy might take longer to recover than the BoE's most recent forecasts indicate. 
None of the 69 economists polled expected the Bank Rate to change when the Monetary Policy Committee meets on Sept. 17.
However, 22 of 25 respondents to an additional question said the Bank would extend its quantitative easing programme, indicating that it would probably add another 100 billion pounds, most likely in November.
""The Bank of England will ultimately decide that it has a further role to play in helping the economy build a sustainable recovery amid likely still challenging and uncertain conditions,"" said Howard Archer at EY ITEM Club.
No change in the Bank Rate was predicted until at least 2023.

594,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>","Australian business leaders respond to corporate scandals, #MeToo movement","By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - A group of mostly male executives from Australia's top companies said in a report on Thursday that boards should be tougher in tackling sexual harassment at a time when the country is facing a number of corporate scandals.
The Male Champions of Change (MCC) group, which has members from the country's biggest pension funds, banks and miners, said firms should work to ensure sexual harassment never takes place rather than just respond to cases when they happen.
The group, which also has some female executives as members, also recommended that companies stop using non-disclosure agreements to prevent people from speaking out.
The proposals come as Australia is being shaken by corporate scandals, which have prompted companies to review their codes of conduct and propelled the issue to the top of their agenda.
""As managers we have a collective responsibility to denounce any form of harassment and misconduct,"" said Simon Rothery, CEO of Goldman Sachs (N:GS) in Australia, who is a member of the group.
The scandals have involved big companies such as wealth manager AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) and QBE Insurance Group Ltd (AX:QBE).
AMP was forced to demote the head of its funds management unit, Boe Pahari, following concerns about alleged inappropriate conduct in 2017. Its chairman David Murray also resigned in the fallout as the board had supported Pahari's promotion despite knowing about the conduct issues.
Pahari has said he ""deeply"" regrets ""the events in 2017"" and Murray said he stepped down to take accountability for the board's decision in response to investor concerns. 
Last week, QBE Insurance Group Ltd (AX:QBE) said its chief executive Patrick Regan would leave the company following an investigation that found he had fallen short of its ethics and conduct standards. Regan has not publicly commented on the matter.
The shake-up has prompted some soul-searching. 
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) told lawmakers last week the recent events had inspired them to review their own past efforts to create a safe environment that encourages women to speak up. The MCC report proposes sexual harassment cases be subject to similar reporting obligations that govern safety issues, and suggests the findings be incorporated in performance metrics in annual reports to hold boards and executives accountable.
""I do consider sexual harassment as a health and safety issue as well as a behavioral issue,"" said David Thodey, former chief executive of Australia's biggest telecommunications provider Telstra (AX:TLS), and a MCC group member.
Australia lags international standards in preventing and responding to cases of sexual harassment, according to a recent inquiry into Australian workplaces.
About two-in-five women and one-in-four-men have been sexually harassed in the workplace in the past five years, according to the report published in May.
""Australia is at a real turning point,"" Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins told Reuters, adding the country was also responding to the global #Metoo movement against sexual abuse and misconduct.
""These organizations now realize it is critical that they act if they want to have successful profitable businesses and (that) the long-term tolerance is no longer cutting it for big business.""

The government has rolled out plans to help businesses but has so far ruled out a cut to value added tax.
Spain, which before the pandemic had the highest density of bars in the world with one for every 175 residents, according to a study by Nielsen consultancy, has been hit especially hard by the coronavirus and on Monday became the first Western European country to pass 500,000 cases.

In an essay published in Foreign Policy magazine, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and chief economist Gita Gopinath said the ongoing economic recovery from the crisis was the result of the rapid implementation and unprecedented scale of government and central bank support, but more efforts would be needed.
""The recovery remains very fragile and uneven across regions and sectors. To ensure that the recovery continues, it is essential that support not be prematurely withdrawn,"" the two economists wrote in the essay.
COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus has killed 900,000 worldwide, and the IMF estimates the total cost of the crisis will reach $12 trillion by the end of 2021, with low-income countries likely to need continued support.
The IMF has provided emergency funding to 75 countries, including 47 low-income countries, and said it was ready to provide further support to a wider range of middle-income countries. 
In addition to supporting workers and businesses, and investing to arrest global warming and reverse rising inequality, the IMF leaders said governments must cooperate internationally to bring the health crisis to an end.
As of Sept. 8, at least 128 vaccines were under development, and 37 had reached human trials, they wrote, forecasting a 90% chance of developing a successful product.
But global cooperation was needed to ensure timely production, adequate supplies for all countries, regardless of their financial means, and an equitable distribution.
The IMF officials lauded creation of COVAX, a global COVID-19 vaccine allocation plan co-led by the World Health Organization that is backed by 76 rich countries, but not the United States.

""Globally synchronized, equitable vaccine distribution is in every country’s interest,"" they wrote. ""An uneven rollout might improve economic conditions in countries that secured the vaccine first but would not shield them from weak demand from trade partners struggling to recover without a vaccine.""

599,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>",Trump administration rolls back U.S. inspection rules for egg products,"By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Wednesday it will stop requiring U.S. plants that produce egg products to have full-time government inspectors, in the first update of inspection methods in 50 years.
Under a new rule that takes effect immediately, the U.S. Department of Agriculture will allow companies like Cargill Inc and Sonstegard Foods to use different food-safety systems and procedures designed for their factories and equipment.
The change marks the Trump administration's latest move to ease government regulations over the nation's food system. Some inspectors and public-interest groups have warned food safety may suffer as a result.
The new rule affects 83 plants that USDA has been inspecting, according to the agency. USDA will also assume oversight from the Food and Drug Administration of additional facilities that produce egg substitutes. 
Inspectors will visit plants once per shift, instead of being there whenever egg products are being processed.
The change, first proposed in 2018, makes inspections consistent with those for meat and poultry products, said Paul Kiecker, administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. Inspectors will operate under a ""patrol"" system, in which they will cover multiple plants each day, he said.
""We feel very confident that, based on the once per shift that we have them there, we'll still be able to verify that they're producing safe product,"" he said.
Environmental group Food & Water Watch said in 2018 the patrol system may make inspections less effective.
The new rule aims to make better use of inspectors and allow companies to develop new food-safety procedures, Kiecker said.
Companies must implement standard operating procedures for sanitation and food-safety management systems known as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points. 
""We are giving them more of the responsibility to ensure that they are producing safe products,"" Kiecker said.

The coronavirus pandemic disrupted egg product sales this spring, as closures of restaurants, schools and offices reduced demand.

600,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 09:54AM ET</span>",ECB Forecasts Said to Show More Confidence in Economic Outlook,"(Bloomberg) -- Some European Central Bank policy makers have become more confident in their forecasts for the region’s economic recovery, potentially reducing the need for more monetary stimulus this year, according to euro-area officials familiar with the discussions.
The latest projections for output and inflation will show only slight changes to the June outlook, the people said, asking not to be named because the report will only be published after the Governing Council meets on Thursday.
The euro gained after the report, which signals relief that while the recovery still remains highly uncertain, some of the downside risks that the ECB stressed in its previous round of forecasts haven’t so far materialized.
The ECB predicted a record 8.7% contraction for 2020 back in June. That figure will now show an improvement, one person said, with private consumption in particular doing much better than expected.
The officials also said that in their view additional monetary support beyond the current 1.35 trillion-euro ($1.6 trillion) emergency bond-buying program doesn’t appear warranted from the current perspective, though that could change. The next round of forecasts in December will be key for that decision, they said.
The euro jumped, putting it on track to snap six days of declines. It was up 0.3% at $1.1815 at 3:36 p.m. Frankfurt time. German 10-year bond yields rose slightly.
An ECB spokesman declined to comment. A full discussion of monetary policy will be held at Thursday’s meeting.
Most respondents in a Bloomberg survey last week predicted an increase in the bond-buying program by December, with a median estimate of 350 billion euros. Economists don’t expect any action this week.
The ECB has previously stressed downside risks to its outlook such as a second wave of infections, more permanent damage to the labor market and weak consumption as a result of elevated uncertainty.
Government Response
Recent data suggests some of those concerns may have eased. Retail sales have already made up all of the ground lost during the worst phase of the crisis, and governments have been reluctant to go back to full-fledged lockdowns even as the virus spreads.
Many nations have extended their furlough programs, and the European Union has agreed on a massive recovery fund.
The less-downbeat view has been reflected in recent comments from some of the ECB’s top officials. Chief economist Philip Lane, who is in charge of forecasts, argued recently that “what we’ve seen over the summer is more or less in line with our baseline projections.”
Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel came to the the same conclusion. As long as the trend remains intact, there’s no reason to change policy, she said.
The euro's relative strength has been added to the ECB’s list of worries though. It has jumped more than 10% against the dollar since late March, breaking through $1.20 for the first time in over two years.

601,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Europe Warns Against Reliance on China in Protectionist Push,"(Bloomberg) --
The European Union’s executive arm said the bloc’s “economic sovereignty is at stake” due to its reliance on imports of raw materials, components and energy, adding to signs of increasing protectionism.
“The EU is heavily dependent on non-EU countries for critical raw materials that are essential for staying at the forefront of global competition -- be it in economic or defense terms,” the European Commission said in its first ever “Strategic Foresight” report, which seeks to prepare policy makers for the challenges of the future. “To preserve EU companies and critical assets, the EU’s openness to foreign investment needs to be balanced by the appropriate tools,” the commission said.
The report is released after the pandemic exposed the EU’s vulnerabilities in areas including healthcare, pharmaceuticals and industrial supply chains. The bloc faced shortages in goods ranging from agricultural products to generic drugs.
Factory closures in Covid-19 hot spots in China forced automotive plants across Europe to shutdown and led to losses equivalent to 12.5% of last year’s total production, the report said. The trauma has led to calls for a more resilient Europe that is less reliant on complex networks of international suppliers.
“Resilience is becoming our new policy compass,” European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic told reporters ahead of the release. The message that EU’s policy focus is set to shift toward ensuring its “strategic autonomy,” which echoes some of the themes raised by U.S. President Donald Trump, is set to be picked up by the bloc’s leaders when they meet in Brussels later this month.
Global ‘Megatrend’
“The shift of power to the East and South is a global megatrend,” the report said. “As the EU’s share in the world population and in global GDP diminishes, this may have a further impact on its clout in many critical areas.”
The EU has been pushing legislative and regulatory measures to protect its global standing against this shift in the global balance of power. These include plans to curb takeovers of European firms, punish imports from polluting companies outside the EU, build a common defense policy, and prevent access to European procurement when there’s no reciprocity.
“The rapidly escalating U.S.-China technological confrontation is disrupting global digital supply chains,” the report said. “It will have a direct impact on the single market and reinforce the need for the EU to pursue its technological sovereignty agenda and strengthen its key digital capacities.”

603,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 09:05AM ET</span>",U.S. regulator calls climate change a systemic risk,"(Reuters) - Climate change poses a ""slow motion"" systemic threat to the stability of the U.S. financial system requiring urgent action from financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Securities Exchange Commission.
That is one of the findings of a landmark report commissioned by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and put together by a panel convened about 10 months ago by Rostin Behnam, one of two Democrats on the five-member CFTC.
The panel's 35 members, including representatives of  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) ,  BP  Plc (L:BP), the Dairy Farmers of America, and The Nature Conservancy among others, approved the report on Tuesday. 
""The physical impacts of climate change are already affecting the United States, and ... the transition to net-zero emissions may also impact many segments of the economy,"" the 196-page report said.
""Both physical and transition risks could give rise to systemic and sub-systemic financial shocks, potentially causing unprecedented disruption in the proper functioning of financial markets and institutions."" 
A sudden shift in perceptions of the risks from frequent wildfires and intense hurricanes could bring a sudden drop in asset prices, for instance, that cascades through a community and spill more broadly into markets, the report said. 
And because the COVID-19 pandemic has depleted household wealth, government budgets and business balance sheets, the economy is more vulnerable than before, it added, ""increasing the probability of an overall shock with systemic implications."" 
The report's release comes less than two months ahead of a national election that pits Republican President Donald Trump, who says climate change is a hoax, against Democratic challenger Joe Biden, who calls climate change an ""existential threat."" 
Its first recommendation is to ""establish a price on carbon"" that is hefty enough to push businesses and markets to cut use of carbon dioxide-producing fuels such as oil and gas. Taxing carbon would require action by Congress. 
But the report's dozens of other recommendations amount to a call for a sweeping rewrite of financial market rules and norms that could go forward without any new laws and no matter who wins the presidency. 
Among the proposals: requiring banks to address climate-related financial risks and listed companies to disclose emissions, and to stress test community banks for their resilience to climate change. 
Regulators in Europe have worked for years on efforts to calibrate and mitigate climate risks to financial markets. 
Regulators in the United States, where politicians regularly cast doubt on the fact that burning fossil fuels is affecting the earth's climate, have lagged far behind on such work.
Only recently has the Federal Reserve begun to acknowledge the potential for climate change to destabilize the financial system, and to think about possible responses.
The report urges financial authorities to integrate climate risk ""into their balance sheet management and asset purchases, particularly relating to corporate and municipal debt.""

It also calls for them to do research into the financial implications of climate change and join international climate-focused groups, such as the Network for Greening the Financial System, all of which appear to specifically apply to the Fed.

604,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 07:07AM ET</span>",Breaking Brexit treaty? Britain announces details for post-EU life,"By Elizabeth Piper
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain announces legislation on Wednesday for life outside the EU after throwing its trade talks with the bloc into jeopardy by announcing in advance that the new plans would break international law and ""clarify"" a deal it signed in January.
The announcement of the plans, which the government said would break international law ""in a very specific and limited way"", has contributed to concerns Britain could be cast out of the European Union's single market with no agreement on trade.
The pound has slid 1.8% against the dollar since Friday and was at its lowest level in six weeks.
Britain quit the EU in January but has remained part of the single market under a status quo agreement which expires in December. It has been negotiating a trade deal that would then take effect, but says it is willing to walk away if it cannot agree favourable terms.
The British government minister responsible for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, told parliament on Tuesday that Wednesday's new bill would break international law but was needed to clarify the Brexit agreement in the event the sides fail to reach a trade deal.
Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said he would speak to Johnson to express ""very strong concerns"" about the initiative while his deputy Leo Varadkar called it a ""kamikaze"" threat that had backfired.
Britain's top civil service lawyer resigned abruptly on Tuesday over what newspapers described as concern about government plans that would break the law.
The trade negotiations have all but stalled over disagreements over fisheries and state aid. EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier arrived in London on Wednesday to meet his British counterpart David Frost with both parties warning they have until October to agree a deal. 
The EU has warned Britain that if it reneges on the divorce treaty there would be no trade agreement.
""What is clear is that agreed deals must be honoured,"" German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said. ""That means negotiations should not be burdened by any unilateral changes made to the content of agreements made between the EU and Britain.""
EU diplomats are uncertain whether Britain's Internal Market Bill is part of a negotiating strategy, following comments by Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week that both sides should move on if no deal could be struck.
END TO UNELECTED EU POWERS 
The new bill will ensure that ""no longer will unelected EU bodies be spending our money on our behalf,"" said Michael Gove, the minister handling Brexit divorce issues for Britain.
""These new spending powers will mean that these decisions will now be made in the UK, focus on UK priorities and be accountable to the UK parliament and people of the UK.""
On Northern Ireland, Lewis said the provisions would ensure businesses based there would have ""unfettered access"" to the rest of Britain, without paperwork.
It would also ensure there would be no legal confusion about the fact that while Northern Ireland would remain subject to EU rules on state aid for business, Britain would not.
Northern Ireland, which borders EU member Ireland, has always been a stumbling block in talks, and almost killed off the Brexit deal until Johnson found agreement with then Irish Prime Minister Varadkar last year.
That agreement calls for border-free trade on the island of Ireland, which the EU says should in some cases require checks on goods passing between Northern Ireland and Britain. But Johnson has ruled out requiring export declarations or tariffs on such goods. He has also said Britain would not be bound by EU rules on providing state aid to companies.
Some fear that a failure to agree on border arrangements could jeopardise the 1998 Good Friday Agreement which largely ended three decades of political and sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland.
Senior members of Johnson's Conservative Party have voiced anger that Britain might consider breaching its obligations under an international treaty.

""Any breach, or potential breach, of the international legal obligations we have entered into is unacceptable, regardless of whether it’s in a ‘specific’ or ‘limited way’,"" Bob Neill, chairman of parliament's justice committee said.

605,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 07:06AM ET</span>","Japan's Suga vows to put growth ahead of fiscal reform, stay course on Abenomics","By Leika Kihara and Chris Gallagher
TOKYO (Reuters) - Yoshihide Suga, on course to become Japan's next prime minister, said he would maintain incumbent premier Shinzo Abe's policy prioritizing economic growth over efforts to fix the country's tattered finances.
Suga, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, also said he would continue to focus on revitalizing regional economies, which he described as among key pillars of ""Abenomics"".
""A strong economy is necessary for social welfare, national security and fiscal reform,"" Suga told a debate hosted by the ruling party on Wednesday. ""We must first revive the economy, because only then can we push through fiscal reform.""
The remarks reinforce market expectations that an administration led by Suga won't trigger big changes to the pro-growth economic policies Shinzo Abe championed during his nearly eight-year stint as prime minister.
If he becomes Japan's next leader, Suga will face the daunting task of containing the coronavirus pandemic while managing the economic consequences.
Japan, the world's third-largest economy, sank deeper into its worst postwar recession in the second quarter, data showed on Tuesday, underscoring the challenges policymakers faces in dealing with the economic blow from COVID-19.
A Kyodo news agency poll on Wednesday showed Suga is the favorite choice among respondents to be the next prime minister, eclipsing two rival candidates vying to succeed Abe by a wide margin.
Suga had 50.2% support, ahead of former Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba with 30.9% and Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) policy chief Fumio Kishida with 8.0%, the poll showed.
Suga enjoys a comfortable lead in the ruling party's race against his two rivals.
The LDP leadership election will be held on Sept. 14, a date set after Abe's decision to step down for health reasons. The winner is virtually assured of becoming premier because of the LDP's parliamentary majority.
An Asahi newspaper tally showed Suga has support to become the LDP's leader from 308 - almost 80% - of ruling party members with seats in parliament.
That means he already has 58% of total LDP votes - more than the majority required - without even counting the additional 141 votes from party prefecture chapters.
Suga has played a key role as Abe's lieutenant in pushing through Abenomics, though the policies' initial gains have been wiped out by the coronavirus pandemic.

On North Korea, Suga repeated his stance that he was prepared to meet with the country's leader, Kim Jong Un, ""with no preconditions"" if needed to resolve the issue of Japanese nationals abducted by North Korean agents.

606,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday, September 9th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are set for a bounce at the opening after the worst one-day losses in months, but Lululemon and Slack face early pressure after their reports late on Tuesday. AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) pauses trialling of its Covid-19 drug. And the U.S. and OPEC both give their two cents' worth on the oil market before the American Petroleum Institute updates on inventories. Here's what's to watch in financial markets on Wednesday, September 9th.
1. Stocks set to bounce after tech rout
U.S. stock markets are set for a not-particularly-convincing bounce at the open after Tuesday’s tech-led rout, which put the Nasdaq Composite firmly in correction territory.
By 6:40 AM ET (1040 GMT), the NASDAQ Futures contract was up 198 points or 1.8%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 0.7 % and the Dow Jones Futures was up 110 points, or 0.4%.
The Nasdaq Composite had fallen over 4.1% on Tuesday amid a rapid unwinding of speculative positions taken on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and the gigacap tech stocks over the summer. Tesla was indicated up 6.9% in premarket after a 21% drop – its worst ever one-day loss – on Tuesday. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was on course to recoup about half of its losses, indicated 3.6% higher. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock was up 2.2%.
2. Asia falls, Europe outperforms
Global markets again went their separate ways, with the Japanese, Korean and Chinese markets all falling heavily while European ones rose.
Like the U.S., China has also witnessed a speculative, retail-driven bull market since March that now looks like it is starting to unwind: the CSI 300 fell 2.3%. The Japanese Nikkei also fell 1.1%, with Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) – whose heavy buying of options fuelled the U.S. summer rally – down another 2.9%, although it rebounded sharply from intraday lows.
European markets by contrast were all higher. Again, that was a function of having accompanied the U.S. lower in afternoon trading on Tuesday. The EUR/USD steadied slightly above $1.1750.
3. AstraZeneca pauses drug trial
AstraZeneca said it will pause the phase 3 clinical trial of the drug that it is developing to treat the Covid-19 virus, in what it described as a ‘routine’ step after an unexplained adverse reaction in a single patient.
The drug, which is being developed jointly with Oxford University, has been widely tipped to be one of the first available next year. It’s the first significant setback for any of the leading vaccine candidates and a reminder of how uncertain the process of drug authorization can be.
The news comes against the backdrop of a heated argument over possible politicization of the approval process in the U.S. AstraZeneca (LON:AZN) stock fell 1.4% in London while those of some of its rivals – such as  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE),  Biontech Se  (NASDAQ:BNTX) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), rose modestly.
4. Slack, Lululemon struggle despite strong earnings 
One tech stock not bouncing in premarket is messaging app Slack (NYSE:WORK), which is marked down 16% after posting disappointing earnings after the close on Tuesday (the market had had the grace not to sell it during the regular session).
The company posted record sales and raised its guidance for the year, but the results still fell short of high expectations.
Another stock failing to make the bounce is  Lululemon Athletica  (NASDAQ:LULU), even though its quarterly report late on Tuesday beat analysts’ forecasts handily as it moved both sales of gear and yoga classes online more smoothly than expected.
5. Oil rebounds ahead of STEO, OPEC and API
Oil prices rebounded overnight as a degree of stability returned to risk assets. By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), U.S. crude futures were up 2.3% at $37.61 a barrel, albeit that’s still clearly below the $40-$45 range that the market had gotten used to over the summer.
Brent futures were up 1.5% at $40.38, after trading below $40 late on Tuesday.
Later Wednesday, the U.S. government will publish its regular Short-Term Energy Outlook while the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will release its monthly oil market report.

607,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>","Thai economy to shrink 7%-9% this yr, protests a worry: business groups","By Satawasin Staporncharnchai and Kitiphong Thaichareon
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's economy is expected to contract between 7% and 9% this year from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, while frequent anti-government protests are a concern, a group of the country's top business associations said on Wednesday.
While most of virus restrictions have been removed, the tourism-and export-reliant economy remains under pressure as the outbreak cuts global demand, according to a joint standing committee on commerce, industry and banking.
""The economy is still very weak,"" Payong Srivanich, chairman of the Thai Bankers' Association, told a briefing.
""Domestic demand is fragile due to high uncertainty, which could hurt consumer and investor confidence,"" he said.
Consumer confidence rose for a fourth month in August, helped by the reopening of businesses and relief measures, but consumer spending will remain very low until at least the fourth quarter, according to a university survey.
The business group said the labour market was worrying, with job losses estimated at more than 3.2 million, of which over 2.5 million people were not in the country's social security programme.
Southeast Asia's second largest economy posted the biggest shrinkage in over two decades in the second quarter as exports tumbled and foreign tourist numbers plunged to zero from April when the country imposed a travel ban to curb the spread.
The number of visitors from overseas is expected at only 6.7 million this year after last year's record 39.8 million, according to the state planning agency.
Almost daily anti-government protests since mid-July, especially a major rally planned for Sept. 19, are another a concern, said Supant Mongkolsuthree, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries.

""This has gone quite far already. If it goes much further, it will affect the economy... foreign investors have already slowed their investment,"" he said.

The European Central Bank says some lenders still haven’t done enough to beef up their European Union operations before the Brexit transition phase expires at the end of the year.
Some banks need to make more progress in moving staff and assets to their EU units, an ECB spokeswoman said in a statement. Together with national regulators, ECB staff “have engaged with these banks to make sure there is a shared understanding of the path toward the target operating model,” she said.
The Financial Times reported the statement earlier.
Global banks that have used London as an EU hub for decades are spending millions of euros to build out units in cities including Frankfurt, Dublin and Paris to retain clients in the bloc after the U.K. voted to leave. While the ECB has acknowledged uncertainty over how the divorce will play out, the watchdog wants the new operations set up quickly and to be robust enough to withstand turmoil.
That means it’s not just about assets and employees. The units also need to try to be “structurally profitable” as well as “operationally self-standing” in key areas, and not overly reliant on their parent companies when booking assets, according to the statement.
The last issue has been key for European watchdogs, who want much of the risk generated by EU units to be managed locally.
“The ECB is encouraged by the fact that some banks have substantially reached their target operating model already or are well on track toward that target,” the spokeswoman said.

609,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 05:18AM ET</span>",Jay Powell Channels Alan Greenspan in Putting His Stamp on Fed,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell makes no secret of his admiration for Alan Greenspan. And now, more than half-way through Powell’s four-year term, his Fed is looking a lot like that of the man once dubbed the monetary maestro.
It is a Fed that, as pronouncements at the institution’s virtual policy symposium last month made clear, prioritizes flexibility in setting monetary policy as it grapples with a pandemic that has devastated the economy. There will be no hard-and-fast rules that determine when to raise interest rates and when to cut them.
Ahead of a policy making meeting next week, discretion -- a hallmark of Greenspan’s time atop the Fed -- is in vogue once again as officials pursue an ultra-expansionary policy to slash unemployment and lift inflation temporarily above its 2% target.
Unlike his immediate predecessors -- Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke -- Powell isn’t an economic Brainiac with a PhD from a prestigious university. A lawyer who made a fortune in private equity, the politically savvy Powell prides himself for his plain talk, not his familiarity with complex economic models that spit out precise policy prescriptions.
“Bernanke and Yellen wanted to make monetary policy scientific,” said Mellon chief economist Vincent Reinhart. “Powell wants to build the Fed’s constituency with the American public and politicians and to do so by backing away from the image of central bankers in white lab coats.”
Even the most theoretically rigorous economists would probably agree that the Fed needs to be nimble in battling the coronavirus crisis, given how uncertain the outlook is. Economic models built on past relationships are of limited value in analyzing a once-in-a-century catastrophe.
Discretion’s Downsides
But discretion has its downsides. It’s harder for the Fed to convince consumers and companies that it’s serious about hitting its new 2% average inflation target without an ironclad commitment to do so. That’s a worry, given how large a role expectations play in the inflation process: If people believe prices are headed higher, they act in ways that tend to bring that about.
A flexible Fed may also be more susceptible to political pressure to keep interest rates low for too long -- pressure that could intensify as government debt spirals upwards. During Powell’s first two years in office, President Donald Trump frequently harangued the Fed for keeping rates too high -- to little apparent effect. A future chair might not be so steadfast.
Another danger from Powell’s uber-expansionary policy: Frothy asset markets. That’s a hazard familiar to Greenspan. His largely successful 20-year career managing the economy was marred by the 2001 Nasdaq stock-market collapse and his tolerance of a housing bubble that burst after he left the Fed in 2006.
The revamped strategy commits the central bank to a goal of maximum employment that for the first time is described as “broad-based and inclusive.” That’s particularly well-timed given the disproportionate impact the pandemic has had on the lives and livelihoods of Black people and other minorities -- and the pressure on the Fed to do something about it.
The change was welcomed by Democrats and Republicans.
Representative Emanuel Cleaver, a Missouri Democrat who chairs the House Financial Services Committee’s monetary policy panel, said he was “personally pleased” by the move, while the committee’s ranking Republican, North Carolina’s Patrick McHenry, called the strategy “a positive thing for the American worker.”
Policy makers also reinterpreted their 2% inflation target, saying they are aiming for that result over time and are willing to temporarily accept price increases above that, without spelling out by how much or for how long.
“We are not tying ourselves to a particular mathematical formula that defines the average,” Powell told the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole policy conference on Aug. 27. “Our decisions about appropriate monetary policy will continue to reflect a broad array of considerations.”
Former Fed official Peter Hooper described that stance as “Greenspanian.”
Powell “is somewhat wary of getting boxed in,” the  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) global head of economic research said.
‘Incomplete’ Grade
At a Sept. 1 virtual Brookings Institution conference, Bernanke tried to argue that the Fed’s new blueprint was not all that different from more precise policy prescriptions proposed by himself and others. In the end, though, he had to acknowledge that the governing document “is not very explicit.”
Asked to grade the Fed’s effort, the former university professor gave it an “incomplete,” saying he expects it to soon unveil more precise guidance on its interest rate plans.
Fed officials seem in no rush to do that. “I would prefer to wait,” Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told Bloomberg Television on Aug. 28. “I would prefer to get more clarity on the path of the virus.”
Greenspan Approach
Greenspan never publicly embraced a numerical target for inflation. Instead he said the Fed would know that it had achieved price stability when households and businesses no longer took inflation into account.
It wasn’t until 2012 that the Bernanke-led Fed adopted a 2% inflation target in its first ever long-run strategy statement.
“When they put out the statement in 2012 the impulse was to etch it in stone,” Reinhart said. “The new version is much more situational. It isn’t for the ages.”
The latest document underscores the Fed’s dilemma today -- a structurally low interest-rate environment -- and promises an in-depth review of the strategy in five years.
“The whole framework is pitched in terms of trying to preserve stability in a complex economic system rather than run a two-variable optimization exercise in an economic model,” said Wrightson ICAP (LON:NXGN) chief economist Lou Crandall.
There are fewer trained economists among Fed policy makers now than there were back in 2012, he pointed out.
The Fed’s review included 13 research papers by staff economists on everything from the impact of average inflation targeting on Black people’s well-being to the fallout it might have in financial markets. That led PGIM Fixed Income chief economist Nathan Sheets to suggest the new strategy is “a fusion of Greenspan with Bernanke and Yellen. It’s rooted in sophisticated state of the art thinking in the economics profession but it also relies heavily on discretion.”
In his first speech at the Fed’s policy conference held in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in 2018, Powell highlighted the uncertainties surrounding such economic concepts as the natural rate of unemployment and praised Greenspan for allowing joblessness to fall below that perceived level in the late 1990s.
The Powell framework takes that one big step further. Instead of shying away from pushing unemployment below its natural rate, the Fed is now open to allowing joblessness to fall ever lower so long as inflation doesn’t show signs of rising too rapidly.
Rules Versus Discretion
There’s a long-running debate in the economics profession over the best way to conduct policy -- via rules or discretion. Supporters of rules contend that a more predictable policy is superior because it enables companies and consumers to better plan for the future. Those who favor discretion argue that central bankers need leeway to respond to changes in the economy.
In the end, though, Powell recognizes that the success of his new approach depends on deeds, not words.
“What we do going forward is really going to decide the effectiveness of the changes that we’ve made,” he told the virtual Jackson Hole conference last month. “Time will tell and our actions will ultimately tell.”

610,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>",U.S. firms in China increasingly fear bilateral tensions will last for years: survey,"By Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. companies in China are increasingly fretful that trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies will drag out over years and nearly a third said their ability to retain staff had been affected, a survey showed.
Half of the firms said they believe soured ties will last at least three years, up sharply from 30% in 2019, according to an annual business sentiment survey conducted by the American Chamber Commerce in Shanghai and consultancy PwC China.
Of those, 27% said they believe tensions will last indefinitely, compared with just 13% last year.
""U.S.-China tension is the top concern for the American business community here,"" Ker Gibbs, president of the business chamber, said at an event to mark the release of the report.
""This Beijing, Washington dialogue, they need to work this out, because it's having an impact on business performance here.""
U.S.-China tensions, already high after last year's trade war, have further intensified this year due to the COVID-19 outbreak and as Washington blacklists or threatens to blacklist Chinese technology companies on national security grounds.
With the U.S. election approaching, President Donald Trump this week again raised the idea of separating the U.S. and Chinese economies, also known as decoupling, suggesting the United States would not lose money if the countries no longer did business.
Underscoring the worries about bilateral tensions as well as economic uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic, only 29% of firms plan to increase their investment in China this year, down from 47% in 2019.
And 32% of respondents said they believe the deterioration in relations was affecting their ability to retain both local and expatriate staff - a view that was particularly pronounced in the education and logistics sectors.
""It's about the attractiveness of a U.S. brand given this atmosphere of tensions,"" Mark Gilbraith, management consulting leader for PwC China.
However, the proportion of companies with a pessimistic five-year outlook receded slightly, at 18.5% versus 21.1% in 2019.
The improvement may be attributable to the Phase One trade deal, the report said, although it noted pessimism remained historically high. Until 2019, firms with pessimistic five-year outlooks had hovered at around 7% for several years.
This year's survey was conducted June 16-July 16 and garnered responses from 346 companies spanning sectors such as industrial manufacturing, automotive and pharmaceutical.
More than 90% of respondents said they were committed to remaining in China and around 70% of the more than 200 firms surveyed that own or outsource production in China said they did not intend to shift manufacturing to other countries. 
Less than 4% are shifting some production back to the United States while 14% are moving some production to non-U.S. locations. The rest represent a mix of moving some production within China and some outside China.

Details of the packages, which will be discussed in the planned 10:30 a.m. meeting, will be announced by the finance minister and related authorities later at 4 p.m., the Blue House said in a statement.
It also said the fourth supplementary budget will be drafted on Thursday, which will then be submitted for parliamentary approval.
On Sunday, the South Korean government and the ruling Democratic party agreed to pursue a fourth extra budget worth more than 7 trillion won ($5.89 billion), most of which would be funded by treasury bonds, a Democratic party spokesperson said.
Last month, South Korea's left-leaning government unveiled plans to increase total spending by 8.5% to a record 555.8 trillion won next year to safeguard jobs and boost welfare for an economy hit by the coronavirus, even after rolling out a total 277 trillion won stimulus so far this year.

The biennial event usually draws key suppliers - such as Airbus SE (PA:AIR),  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC) - and has traditionally been used by Beijing to show off its growing aviation capability, such as military fighters and drones.
The cancellation comes as foreign nationals are largely barred from entering China due to concerns about importing coronavirus cases and as international flights have been severely restricted.
It follows the cancellation of this year's largest aerospace expo, Britain's Farnborough Airshow, because of travel curbs and an industry downturn resulting from the pandemic.
China's domestic aviation industry has been recovering and is now running at more than 90% of pre-pandemic capacity levels, according to data firm OAG, but that has yet to translate into a return to profitability for Chinese airlines.
As the global industry reels from the devastating impact of the pandemic, many Western aerospace companies have reduced budgets and some were not planning to attend the Zhuhai airshow if it had gone ahead, company sources told Reuters.

Progress on some key civilian aircraft programmes including COMAC's narrowbody jet C919 and widebody CR929, jointly developed with Russia, has also been slow amid rising geopolitical tensions.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand is planning new projects worth about 30 billion baht ($956 million) to support its farm sector and create rural jobs, its planning agency said on Wednesday, as it tries to restore an economy devastated by the coronavirus pandemic's global impact. 
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy suffered its biggest shrinkage in more than two decades in the second quarter as the coronavirus outbreak froze tourism and slowed consumption.
The new projects aim to boost rural incomes by developing farm technology, creating community products and promoting tourism, with plans to hire 69,000 students for government programmes, said Danucha Pichayanan, deputy head of the National Economic and Social Development Council.
""We are considering 3-4 projects worth about 20 billion to 30 billion baht,"" he told a briefing, adding the projects would be proposed to cabinet on Tuesday.
They will be financed by the government's 1 trillion baht of borrowing - 400 billion baht for reviving the economy and 600 billion baht for relief and health measures - as it tries to mitigate the impact of the virus, which has infected just over 3,400 people locally.
Under the 400 billion baht plan, about 45 billion in projects have been approved and should add about 100,000 jobs, said planning agency head Thosaporn Sirisumphand.
""But we don't want to spend the money all at once because we have to live with COVID-19 for at least a year,"" he said.
However, the government is working on a new stimulus package, Thosaporn said, including plans approved on Tuesday to help pay for hiring 260,000 graduates.
On relief measures, the government has spent about 300 billion baht to help businesses and households. 
Thailand's tourism-reliant economy is expected to contract by a record 8.5% this year, with foreign tourist numbers seen at less than a fifth of last year's nearly 40 million.

Russia, Japan, Australia, South Korea and India are among those remotely joining an event hosted by Vietnam that will include a 27-nation security forum, as concern grows about rhetoric and accidental conflict, and about other countries being caught up in the fray. 
""The regional geopolitical and geoeconomic landscape, including the South China Sea, are witnessing growing volatilities that are detrimental to peace and stability,"" Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said in his opening speech at the summit.

Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi cautioned the United States and China against entangling South East Asian nations in their geopolitical battle. [nL4N2G52QS
""We don't want to get trapped by this rivalry,"" Retno told Reuters ahead of the ASEAN Regional Forum, which will convene on Sept. 12.
Retno said ASEAN did not want to take sides, while also describing the increased militarisation in the South China Sea as ""worrying"". 
The United States has spoken out strongly against China over trade, technology and its maritime conduct, and President Donald Trump has trumpeted his tough approach to China in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election.
Washington has accused Beijing of bullying its neighbours by sending ships close to their offshore energy operations, and of opportunism in holding military exercises and testing new defence hardware in disputed locations, while rival claimants battle coronavirus outbreaks. China said its actions were lawful.
Since mid-August, the United States has repeatedly riled China by sending warships to the South China Sea and the sensitive Taiwan Strait and flew a reconnaissance plane over Chinese live-fire drills.
It blacklisted 24 Chinese entities over their involvement in building and militarising artificial islands.
""There's no desire to take sides - or to be seen to be doing so,"" said Collin Koh, a security expert at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. 
ASEAN would instead discuss with China the advancement of a long-delayed code of maritime conduct, and the development and access to a COVID-19 vaccine, he said.
The group's talks with the United States would urge military restraint and greater investments from corporate America, he said. Both would seek to ""de-focus on the intensifying rivalry"".

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Uncontrolled wildfires driven by high winds and unprecedented temperatures raged across the U.S. West on Tuesday, incinerating the Washington town of Malden and threatening communities in Oregon and California.
Firefighters and emergency responders searched on Tuesday for residents of tiny Malden, about 300 miles (480 km) east of Seattle, a day after a firestorm destroyed 80% of its homes, along with the fire station, post office, city hall and library.
""The scale of this disaster really can't be expressed in words,"" said Brett Myers, sheriff of Whitman County, where the town of 200-300 people is located. ""I pray everyone got out in time.""
The fire that destroyed Malden erupted about noon on Sunday, driven by winds of 40 miles per hour (34 knots), Myers told Reuters.
Authorities went door-to-door ordering evacuations before the blaze arrived. The fire engulfed most of the town over the course of about three hours. 
""It moved incredibly fast,"" Myers said.
That fire was one of dozens of large blazes burning in Washington, Oregon and California over the Labor Day holiday weekend, as the thermometer soared. Temperatures in the western part of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley topped 121 degrees Fahrenheit (49 Celsius).
""I have no patience for climate change deniers,"" California Governor Gavin Newsom said, pointing to the high temperatures, as well as years of drought that have killed millions of trees, providing fuel for fires. ""It simply is completely inconsistent ... with the reality on the ground."" 
PEAK FIRE SEASON
About 14,000 firefighters battled 25 blazes in California with more than 2.2 million acres (890,308 hectares) charred since the fire season got an early - and deadly - start last month, a record for this point in the year, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said on Tuesday. The state's peak fire season has yet to begin.
Fires forced thousands of residents to evacuate their homes and closed several nationl forests across the state.
Smoke darkened the skies and made breathing difficult as far north as Canada and well down the coast toward Southern California. In the state capital of Sacramento, the skies were gray and it was difficult to breathe, as high winds carried in dust and smoke from numerous fires. 
Air throughout much of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys, the state's agricultural breadbasket, was rated ""hazardous"" by the state. 
The Creek Fire in the Fresno area of central California, which caused the weekend emergency evacuation of more than 200 people vacationing at a popular reservoir, grew overnight under what CalFire on Tuesday called ""extreme conditions.""
The blaze, which started on Sept. 4, threatened the community of Shaver Lake, among others, fueled in part by trees weakened by drought and killed by the invasive bark beetle, the fire agency said.
HELICOPTER EVACUATIONS
At a news conference on Tuesday, Newsom praised the firefighters who led a helicopter evacuation of the area, saying they saved 214 people in smoky conditions that made it difficult to see.
""They very easily could have turned around and said the smoke made that mission too dangerous,"" Newsom said, calling the rescuers heroic. Rescue efforts continued on Tuesday, he said, with about 165 people airlifted to safety and escape routes sought for more than a dozen more.
By Tuesday morning, the fire was completely uncontained and had burned 144,000 acres (58,275 hectares), CalFire said. 
Firefighters on the ground were also in peril. 
Fifteen firefighters fighting another blaze in the Los Padres National Forest were forced to take cover in their personal fire shelters, which is ""considered a life-saving measure and a last resort,"" said Chris Barth, a spokesman for the Pacific Northwest Team Two fire command. Three were seriously injured, one critically.
Pacific Gas & Electric (N:PCG) (PG&E) shut off power to thousands of residents in 22 counties in California to prevent sparks from its equipment from setting off more fires.
A fire in San Bernardino County, southeast of Los Angeles, that officials said was caused by a pyrotechnic device used during a gender reveal party, had burned nearly 11,000 acres by Tuesday morning and was 16% contained, CalFire said.
Newsom on Sunday declared a state of emergency in Fresno, Madera, Mariposa, San Bernardino and San Diego counties due to the wildfires. 
In Oregon, several communities were evacuated and the first day of school postponed, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported.

617,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 07:05PM ET</span>",Explainer: What we know about China's 'dual circulation' economic strategy,"By Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China has unveiled a ""dual circulation"" strategy to cut its dependence on overseas markets and technology in its long-term development, a shift brought on by a deepening rift with the United States.
WHAT IS THE 'DUAL CIRCULATION' MODEL?
Chinese President Xi Jinping first raised the idea in May and later elaborated that China will rely mainly on ""internal circulation"" - the domestic cycle of production, distribution, and consumption - for its development, supported by innovation and upgrades in the economy.
Xi also said ""internal circulation"" will be supported by ""external circulation"".
No further details have been announced on the strategy.
Three decades ago, former leader Deng Xiaoping adopted a ""great international circulation"" strategy, but the 2008-09 global crisis exposed the vulnerability of the export-led model and prodded policymakers to rebalance growth towards domestic demand.
The ""dual circulation"" strategy could become a key priority in the government's 14th five-year plan (2021-2025), due to be unveiled during the annual parliament session in early 2021.
DOMESTIC CYCLE
To jump-start ""internal circulation,"" China needs to boost household incomes and consumption.
Key would be its ongoing urbanisation programme to turn millions of migrant workers into city dwellers to expand China's middle class. About 60% of China's population live in urban areas.
China is already a ""hyper-sized"" consumer market with 1.4 billion people. Its rapidly growing middle class is at least over 400 million strong.
So far this year, the recovery in consumption has lagged behind production amid job losses and economic uncertainties brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.
SUPPLY CHAINS
China has boasted the most complete manufacturing supply chains in the world, helped by foreign companies.
But tension with the United States has exposed China's vulnerability as it relies heavily on U.S. high-tech products, such as semiconductors, forcing Beijing to spur domestic innovation in efforts to secure domestic supply chains.
Under the ""dual circulation"" strategy, Xi aims to boost tech innovation and push Chinese firms up the global value chain, key to globalising China's home-grown companies, boosting household incomes, and in turn, stimulating domestic demand.
Chinese leaders still advocate greater market opening to attract more foreign investment in high-end manufacturing to strengthen its supply chain security and deter foreign countries' from luring firms away from China.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's government is proposing to rein in debt and offer only targeted spending increases in a 2021 budget that favors fiscal conservatism over stimulus spending for an economy hammered by the coronavirus pandemic.
A finance ministry draft of the budget, which was made public by officials at the lower house of Congress on Tuesday, proposed lowering debt as a proportion of gross domestic product by the end of next year.
Finance ministry officials are due to present the final budget plan to the lower house later on Tuesday.
The document proposed increased spending for some social programs including pensions, but forecast only 6.4% revenue growth over 2020, a year in which the economy is forecast to contract the most in almost 90 years.
State oil company Petroleos Mexicanos, which is poised to receive 45 billion pesos ($2.07 billion) to help its financial position, also stood out in terms of new allocations.
The draft predicts that Mexico's primary budget balance - the calculation which excludes interest payments on existing debt - will be nil next year and that its economy will grow by about 4.6%.
""Assuming that these numbers are correct, it seems that they still want to maintain a healthy fiscal balance sheet,"" said Julio Ruiz, chief economist for Mexico, at Brazilian bank Itau, about the draft.
Lopez Obrador is an outlier among both wealthy and emerging nations, insisting on keeping spending tight even in the face of the economic destruction wrought by coronavirus lockdown.
""It looks like goals of fiscal control are favored over programs of economic reactivation,"" said Jose Luis de la Cruz, director of Mexico's Industrial Development and Economic Growth Institute.
""For the Mexican government it is very important to send a signal that there is a very strong commitment to avoid further indebting the country,"" he said.
The Mexican economy is in the deepest slump since the 1930s Great Depression. Mexico's central bank recently warned it could contract by 13% this year. The bank forecasts between 1.3% and 5.6% growth next year.
Lopez Obrador argues his discipline will eventually leave healthier finances, while ruling out more taxes or new social programs.

Citing initial calculations for the interim tax estimate, which Finance Minister Olaf Scholz will announce on Thursday, the business daily said the state will receive about 10 billion euros less next year than previously estimated.
However, after 2022, things will start to improve, the newspaper quoted a government source as saying.
It said the lower revenues through to the end of 2024 were mainly due to changes made to taxes and benefits, such as child benefit, which will increase next year. The government has also reduced sales tax.
As Germany faces its deepest recession since World War Two, Scholz is working on a budget for next year. The minister told Reuters this week that more debt was needed to sustain economic recovery.

620,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>","Russia's economy to shrink by less than 4% in 2020, minister says","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's economy could contract by less than 4% in 2020, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Tuesday, an improvement on previous assessments and a positive sign for an economy bruised by low oil prices and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Speaking at a financial forum in Moscow alongside Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina, Siluanov warned against excessive borrowing to finance Russia's economic recovery.
The debt-to-GDP ratio will reach nearly 20% in 2021 and must not increase further, Siluanov said.
And at a time when Russia is facing the real threat of additional sanctions over the suspected poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, Siluanov sought to woo foreign investors, attracted to Russia's OFZ treasury bonds thanks to their relatively attractive yields. 
""The amount of debt that we borrow this year will depend, among other things, on whether foreign investors trust us,"" said Siluanov.
""If we do not have as many foreign investors, we will not borrow as much. Therefore, we need to value this trust."" 
Speaking ahead of the central bank's rate-setting meeting on Sept. 18, Siluanov said lower interest rates would help revive economic growth.
Economists polled by Reuters last month, before the rouble's rapid depreciation, forecast a 4.7% economic contraction in 2020 and said subdued inflationary risks could give Russia room to cut rates for a fifth time this year.
Nabiullina gave no new signals as to whether the central bank would cut the key rate from 4.25% next week, reiterating the bank's earlier statement that there was room for a monetary policy manoeuvre.
""All will depend on how the situation with the pandemic evolves, with the economy in general, with inflation,"" she said. 
The Bank of Russia sees inflation at 3.7-4.2% by the end of the year, and Nabiullina was insistent that there is no need to revise its 4% inflation target.
Neither Nabiullina nor Siluanov addressed the issue of the weak rouble, dented by risks of Western sanctions against Moscow related to the turmoil in Belarus and the poisoning of Navalny.

LONDON (Reuters) - Confidence in using public transport is holding back bankers from returning to their offices, the City of London's leader said on Tuesday.
Catherine McGuinness said she was ""very concerned"" about how the lack of people in the financial district was hitting support services like shops and cafes. Some 40% to 50% of staff are expected to return to the office up to the medium term, she told reporters.
One of the main barriers to people returning to the ""Square Mile"" was low confidence in public transport, she said. 
""We would like to get out the message that there is capacity on the public transport system, it's as safe as possible to use,"" McGuinness said.
Footfall was recovering better in other parts of the capital, she said, but there was no sign yet of a reduction of interest in City commercial property, even though office usage is likely to change.
The City is facing the prospect of losing lucrative access from January to the European Union, its biggest customer, as tensions mount between London and Brussels over trade talks.
It was ""regrettable"" that there was no rapid progress in Britain securing a deal with the EU before Brexit transition arrangements end on Dec. 31, McGuinness said.
The EU will not allow banks in Britain to offer investment services to customers in the bloc, with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) relocating some European investment banking operations from London to Madrid.
Nevertheless, McGuinness urged Britain to grant access for EU financial firms to the UK market soon and live up to its reputation as an open trading country.
""I don't think the government is giving as much focus to financial services as it ought to be doing,"" she said.
""We have come through plagues and fire before, and I am very confident the City will thrive after this,"" McGuinness said, referring to the Great Plague that was followed by the Fire of London in 1666 that spawned the insurance industry.

622,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 09:35AM ET</span>","In new Brexit turmoil, UK may break law in 'limited way'","By Michael Holden and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain headed into a fresh round of Brexit trade talks on Tuesday acknowledging it could break international law but only in a ""limited way"" after reports it may undercut its divorce treaty with the European Union.
As the pound fell sharply on fears of a no-deal exit, the government's legal department head quit in disagreement with a plan to overwrite parts of the Withdrawal Agreement treaty signed in January.
Britain left the European Union on Jan. 31 but talks on new trade terms have made little headway as the clock ticks down to an October deadline and then the end of the status-quo transition arrangement in late December.
As diplomats gauged whether Johnson was blustering or serious about allowing a tumultuous finale to the four-year saga, Britain insisted it would abide by the treaty.
Asked if anything in the proposed legislation potentially breached international legal obligations or arrangements, Northern Ireland minister Brandon Lewis said: ""Yes, this does break international law in a very specific and limited way."" 
""We are taking the powers to disapply the EU law concept of direct effect required by article 4 in a certain, very tightly defined circumstance,"" he told parliament. 
He added that the government supported the Northern Ireland protocol of the Withdrawal Agreement and there was ""clear precedence"" for what Britain was planning.
TRUST AT STAKE
Amid warnings from the EU that if it reneged on the divorce deal there would be no agreement governing the roughly $1 trillion annual trade, former Prime Minister Theresa May said the government risked serious damage to its international image.
""The government is now changing the operation of that agreement,"" May, who resigned after her own Brexit deal was repeatedly rejected, told parliament.
""Given that, how can the government reassure future international partners that the UK can be trusted to abide by the legal obligations of the agreements it signs?"" May asked.
The Financial Times said the government's ""very unhappy"" legal head Jonathan Jones walked out in protest over the possible plan to undercut the withdrawal agreement in relation to the protocol for British-ruled Northern Ireland.
The prospect of a messy divorce between the EU's $16 trillion and United Kingdom's $3 trillion economies pushed sterling to two-week lows with traders betting there was more volatility to come.
""We need to see more realism from the EU about our status as an independent country,"" said David Frost, Britain's top Brexit negotiator, adding that Britain was ramping up no-deal preparations.
The latest round of negotiations in London are likely to be tough: Britain says the EU has failed to understand it is now independent - especially when it comes to fishing and state aid.
The EU, weary of wrangling, says it needs specifics from London and that Britain cannot make its own rules and have preferential access to its markets.
""A disorderly Brexit would not be good for Europe, it would be a real disaster for Britain and its citizens,"" German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told Reuters. 

British officials say they can make do with an Australia-style arrangement. Australia is negotiating a free trade deal with the EU to improve its market access, but for now largely trades with the bloc on World Trade Organization terms.

623,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 09:18AM ET</span>",U.K. Government Says It Will Break International Law Over Brexit,"(Bloomberg) --
A U.K. minister conceded Boris Johnson’s government will break international law by attempting to re-write the Brexit divorce deal the prime minister signed with the European Union last year.
Northern Ireland Minister Brandon Lewis told lawmakers in the House of Commons on Tuesday that a planned law that would supersede parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement applying to Northern Ireland would “break international law, in a very specific and limited way.”
“There are clear precedents for the U.K. and indeed other countries needing to consider their international obligations as circumstances change,” Lewis said.
He spoke hours after the resignation of Jonathan Jones, the U.K.’s top government lawyer for the past six years. Johnson’s spokesman James Slack declined to comment on the reasons for his departure.
The suggestion that the prime minister is preparing to walk away from an international treaty risks reviving one of the most controversial disagreements in Brexit -- how to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. It could jeopardize efforts to secure a wide-ranging agreement on the U.K. and EU’s relationship by the year-end.
“How can the government reassure future international partners that the U.K. can be trusted to abide by the legal obligations of the agreements it signs?” Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, asked in Parliament on Tuesday.
As talks between David Frost and Michel Barnier, the two sides’ lead Brexit negotiators, resumed in London, the EU warned that backsliding on the divorce deal would scupper any chance of a trade deal, increasing the risk of economically-damaging tariffs and quotas being introduced at the end of the year.
The controversy centers on the Withdrawal Agreement’s requirement that Northern Ireland continues to be bound by the EU’s customs rules after Britain leaves the EU’s single market and customs union on Dec. 31. That effectively established a border in the Irish Sea, with businesses in Northern Ireland facing the prospect of having to file customs paperwork if they want to move goods to the rest of the U.K.
In a bill due to be published on Wednesday, Johnson’s government plans to give ministers the powers to waive the requirement for such paperwork, should the issue not be settled by joint talks with the EU this year. Johnson’s office said the prime minister made promises prior to signing the divorce deal that he wanted to uphold, including that there would be no paperwork on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
“The Withdrawal Agreement and Protocol aren’t like any other treaty,” Lewis told MPs on Tuesday. “It was written on the assumption that subsequent agreement could be reached between us and the EU on the detail,” he said. “We continue to believe that is possible -- but, as a responsible government, we cannot allow businesses to not have certainty for January.”
Lewis said the U.K. is taking the power to disapply the EU law concept of “direct effect” required in certain tightly defined circumstances.

624,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 08:55AM ET</span>","Pulled in many directions, Biden may keep Trump's China tariffs in place","By David Lawder and Trevor Hunnicutt
WASHINGTON/WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - “Damaging,” “reckless” and “disastrous” are some of the words Joe Biden has used to describe tariffs imposed by Donald Trump on allies and rivals alike.He may keep some in place anyway if he is elected president of the United States in November.
Republicans largely abandoned traditional party goals such as unfettered trade and balanced budgets to embrace Trump's ""America First"" agenda. For Democratic-party challenger Biden, with a history of supporting free trade but also attuned to voices calling out for a different approach, the task is not so simple.
Biden is backed by labor unions who want job protections and infrastructure spending, and progressives who want action on climate change, lower drug prices and human rights, while facing demands from farmers and U.S. corporations eager for tariff cuts and a less disruptive China trade relationship.
The mix of conflicting interests adds up to a wait-and-see approach that could keep many of the tariffs Biden would inherit from Trump in place for years, say former and current advisers, lobbyists and trade analysts. 
""It's unclear how he will balance these different competing forces,"" said Mary Lovely, a Syracuse University economics professor and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 
The series of staggered tariffs the Trump administration imposed on $370 billion worth of Chinese goods in 2018 and 2019 have cost U.S. importers some $61.6 billion to date, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/trade, and have been blamed for eroding U.S. manufacturing competitiveness.
Duties on steel, aluminum, washing machines, solar panels and European Union goods added another $12.2 billion in punitive collections through Sept. 2. 
The U.S. trade deficit with China narrowed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/u-s-trade-deficit-shrinks-in-2019-for-first-time-in-six-years-idUSKBN1ZZ1WP in 2019, but Census Bureau data on Thursday showed the nation's trade gap in July jumped to $63.6 billion, its widest in 12 years, with China accounting for nearly half of it.
Trade experts say Biden's hands may be tied. 
""I don't see any scenario in which he can go in, in the first 6-12 months, and lift those tariffs,"" said Nathan Sheets, a former Obama administration Treasury undersecretary who negotiated with China on economic issues.
""The current political environment - left, right and center - is going to require Biden to be tough on China,"" said Sheets, now chief economist with PGIM Fixed Income.
FROM FREE TRADE TO FAIR TRADE
Biden has backed free trade over his three decades in Congress, during a period when increasing globalization was viewed as a path to prosperity. He supported the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and China's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001. 
As vice president, he was a vocal proponent of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Obama administration's attempt to counter China's growing influence in Asia.
That support for free trade has given ammunition for Trump to attack Biden as being ""soft on China"" and allowing U.S. jobs to migrate to low-wage countries. 
Biden has struck back, saying he is not afraid to use trade barriers - but only when they make sense.
""I will use tariffs when they are needed, but the difference between me and Trump is that I will have a strategy - a plan - to use those tariffs to win, not just to fake toughness,"" Biden wrote in a statement to the United Steelworkers union in May. Steel and aluminum tariffs would stay until a global solution to limit excess production - largely centered in China - can be negotiated, it said. 
Biden's ""Made in All of America"" economic plan https://joebiden.com/made-in-america/# suggests the use of carbon-based tariffs to punish countries failing to meet climate goals, a move that could please progressives eager for the United States to take a stand on global warming.
The plan also vows reform of the World Trade Organization, and ""aggressive trade enforcement actions"" against unfair practices by China and other countries, including currency manipulation, dumping of below-cost exports, and ""state-owned company abuses, or unfair subsidies."" 
The Trump administration aimed to address Chinese dumping and state subsidies, but the Phase 1 trade deal does not.
MAKING PEACE WITH ALLIES ON TRADE
One way Biden would depart from Trump is by consulting with allies about the best way to deal with China, said Jeff Prescott, a Biden campaign policy adviser.
Working with Europe, Japan and other allies ""can bring a significant percentage of the global economy to bear"" on China to curb non-market practices and to reform WTO rules, he said. 
Trump still has support from many blue-collar workers in the swing states of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, but Biden is backed by the country's biggest union group.
AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said on Thursday he believes Biden would impose rules to ""keep workers safe"" in the pandemic, use tax incentives to encourage the reshoring of critical supply chains and deliver a major infrastructure spending drive, with strong ""Buy American"" requirements.
Trump, he said, ""hasn't lived up to his hype."" 
Jon Lieber, U.S. managing director for the Eurasia Group political risk consultancy, said that while what Biden is proposing is a different brand of economic nationalism than Trump, ""lower barriers for China would be totally inconsistent with that goal."" 
Whatever the decisions on trade, Biden advisers say there is no going back to the pre-Trump trade consensus, where businesses successfully pushed U.S. governments to continually shrink trade barriers, while touting globalization.

""There's a kind of recognition that ultimately the goal of international economic policy is not to make the world safe for multinational corporations to do business,"" said Prescott. ""It's fundamentally about jobs in the United States, about the middle class at home and building our economy here.""

(Reuters) - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Chief Executive Jeff Bezos topped Forbes' list of richest Americans for the third year in a row, while U.S. President Donald Trump's ranking dropped as the coronavirus pandemic slammed his office buildings, hotels and resorts, the magazine said Tuesday. 
The aggregate wealth of the Forbes 400 list rose to a record $3.2 trillion, as the richest Americans continued to do well even though the pandemic has devastated the economy and caused more than 1.8 million Americans to lose their jobs.
Eric Yuan, chief executive officer of  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM), which has become ubiquitous in the work-from-home era, was one of 18 newcomers on the list with a net worth of $11 billion. 
Trump's ranking dropped to No. 352 from 275 last year as his net worth fell to $2.5 billion from $3.1 billion, as office buildings, hotels and resorts, have suffered during the pandemic. His business, the Trump Organization, owns property in all three categories.
Trump has long refused to release his tax records, and has been locked in a battle with Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, who subpoenaed Trump for eight years of personal and corporate returns.
The annual list can serve as a way to track the wealthiest people in the country who hold the most power, said Kerry Dolan, assistant managing editor of wealth at Forbes, in an interview with Reuters TV.

""As a society, we all should know who is behind the biggest companies and what they're doing with their money,"" she said.

“In the last two years, regulated entities slightly increased their submissions of assessments of their diversity policies and practices,” Sheila Clark, program director of the Fed’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion, said in congressional testimony published ahead of a hearing Tuesday. “However, we are not satisfied with the level of responsiveness.”
She said the Fed is continuing to explore ways to promote greater participation by the banks, including by working with other financial regulators.
Much of Clark’s scheduled testimony to a House Financial Services Committee panel was devoted to detailing the steps that the Fed has taken to promote diversity.
Among the “significant accomplishments” she cited was an increase in the number of women and minorities in senior leadership positions at the Fed Board in Washington. “In 2019, there were 19 appointments to the official staff, of which five were minorities (26%) and six were women (32%),” she said in testimony posted on the Fed’s and committee’s website.
The Fed’s Board of Governors “is deeply committed to an inclusive workplace and a diverse workforce, as well as to fostering diversity in our own procurement practices and those at the institutions we regulate,” Clark said.

Meadows also said he saw a “groundswell of support among rank-and-file Democrats and Republicans” to suggest there’s some type of compromise possible over coronavirus relief. Democrats have pressed for a comprehensive package of about $2.2 trillion, scaled down from an earlier $3.4 trillion, while Senate Republicans are working on a $500 billion bill.
“I know as late as 9 o’clock last night I was on the phone with a couple of senators as well as Senate leadership to make sure that we put forth a bill coming out of the Senate that at least provides a foundation for getting an agreement,” Meadows said in an interview with Fox Business News Tuesday.
“The stumbling block is aid to state and local governments,” Meadows added, reiterating his opposition to the Democrats’ proposal for almost $1 trillion in aid for regional authorities that have seen their revenues devastated by the Covid-19 crisis.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is aiming for a vote on the so-called skinny stimulus bill as the Senate comes back from recess this week. But the Republicans would need to overcome a potential filibuster by Democrats favoring a bigger package. And there’s little chance of passage in the House, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi also calling for more robust aid.
Meadows said he was “more optimistic perhaps today than I’ve been in a long time,” after conversations with lawmakers. He added that he was “optimistic in the next two weeks that the pressure and the voice of the American people will start to have an impact on members of Congress” and help seal a deal.

628,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 06:32AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Tuesday, September 8th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) plummets after stock sale and S&P 500 rejection, and the rest of the Nasdaq is also cooling off rapidly. President Donald Trump promises 'massive' tariffs on China and a 'decoupling' from its economy if he's re-elected, Sterling falls as Boris Johnson revives the threat of a disorderly end to the Brexit transition period, and crude oil hits a three-month low as the end of driving season focuses the market a worsening supply-demand balance. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, September 8th.
1. Tech selling gathers pace 
Tech stocks are set to extend their recent declines at the open, as the froth continues to come off a market skewed by heavy activity in single-stock options.
Nasdaq 100 futures were down 2.2% by 6:20 AM ET (1020 GMT), while Dow futures were flat and S&P 500 futures were down a relatively modest 0.7%.
Other megacaps were also beset by profit-taking: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was down another 3.8%, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock were all down by over 3%.
2. Trump threatens 'massive tariffs' on China if re-elected
President Donald Trump launched a fresh broadside against China, promising a “decoupling” of the U.S. economy from the Chinese one if he is re-elected in November.
“We will…will end our reliance on China once and for all,” Trump said, in a reprise of his 2016 election campaign. He threatened to impose “massive tariffs” on imports from China and to block from federal contracts U.S. companies that outsource jobs to China.
Trump has held off from imposing fresh tariffs this year despite China’s clear failure to buy the volumes of U.S. goods it promised in January, apparently unwilling to risk making imports more expensive at a time when 29 million Americans are claiming jobless benefits.
3. Tesla slumps after stock sales, S&P spurning
The catalyst for the sell-off is, to a large degree, Tesla stock. It slumped 11% after saying it completed the sale of $5 billion in common stock on Friday.
The share price was also still under pressure from the announcement by Standard & Poor’s on Friday that it would not be admitted to the S&P 500 index for the present.  The announcement disappointed hopes that the passively-managed money tracking the S&P 500 would be forced to buy it to comply with their investment mandates.
If Tesla opens at its current level, it would be some 25% below its all-time high from earlier in the month, but still around 30% above where it was when the wave of speculation on S&P 500 inclusion began.
4. Sterling falls on revived Brexit risks
The pound slumped to a one-month low against the dollar and a three-week low against the euro on the dawning realization that the U.K. government has put the prospect of a disorderly Brexit back on the agenda.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson signalled on Monday that he was unwilling to abide in future by the Withdrawal Agreement that his government signed last year. The agreement is the basis of an 11-month transition period in which the reality of leaving the EU’s Single Market was for all practical purposes suspended. That transition period ends on Dec. 31st.
U.K. stocks fell less than European ones, owing to the usual currency effects that increase the sterling value of foreign earnings for U.K.-listed companies. The FTSE 100 fell 0.3%.
5. Oil hits three-month low as driving season ends
Crude oil prices fell to their lowest in 10 weeks as the end of the peak driving season in the U.S. focused the market’s attention on a worsening supply/demand balance.
Prices had already weakened on Monday after Saudi Arabia cut official selling prices for all of its major export grades to Asian customers. That in turn came against a backdrop of data showing a sharp slowdown in crude buying by Chinese importers in August. Independent refiners in particular had taken advantage of the second-quarter collapse in prices to buy in huge volume in July.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), U.S. crude futures were down 3.6% at $38.33, having earlier fallen as low as $38.18. Brent futures were down 1.6% at $41.33 a barrel, just off an intraday low of $41.21.
The American Petroleum Institute’s weekly report on U.S. oil stocks, which normally falls on a Tuesday, is delayed by a day due to the holiday weekend.

Japan's ruling party will choose a new leader next week to take over from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has decided to step down for health reasons. His successor will become the next premier and form a new cabinet.
The political changes, which could lead to a new foreign minister succeeding incumbent Toshimitsu Motegi, heighten the need for the two countries to speed up trade talks, the official said.
""We want to reach a broad agreement on trade talks with Britain this week under Foreign Minister Motegi,"" the official said, a view echoed by another government official.
""Otherwise, a trade pact between Japan and Britain may not come into force January 1 next year considering Japan's political situation,"" the first official said.
Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.

Britain, which left the European Union in January, is seeking to clinch a trade agreement with Japan based on the 2019 EU-Japan agreement by the end of the year, when Britain's no-change transition arrangement with the EU will expire.

The newspaper said Jonathan Jones was leaving his job due to a dispute with Johnson's office over its reported plans to undercut the Withdrawal Agreement treaty signed in January in relation to the Northern Ireland protocol.
The FT said on Monday that Britain was considering tinkering with the deal's special arrangements for Northern Ireland which aim to avoid creating a hard border with the Irish Republic and allow trade to flow while protecting the bloc's internal market.
Britain said in response it was committed to the treaty but that it needed minor clarifications and a backup plan to support the 1998 Northern Ireland peace deal. 
Unnamed sources close to Jones, the Treasury lawyer and head of the Government Legal Department, said he was ""very unhappy"" with the decision to overwrite parts of the Northern Ireland protocol, the FT said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market's two-day tech-led fall last week has revived investor worries about a spiral of selling that could crash the broader market, but Rick Rieder, head of the BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Global Allocation team, does not see stocks going off a cliff.
Indeed, the $23.2 billion BlackRock Global Allocation Fund (O:MALOX) that Rieder runs currently has options trades that would benefit from a rebound in stocks. 
Last week's pullback in U.S. stocks from record highs came after investors piled into big tech names such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) - particularly buying bullish call options. That has caused debate about whether shares are over-extended as investors, buoyed by central bank support, try to look beyond the coronavirus pandemic.
""I think the market is going to keep going higher,"" Rieder, said in a Reuters interview. The Global Allocation Fund has been selling calls against existing long positions in large-cap, high-flying tech stocks to benefit from gains if they shake off recent weakness. 
Rieder says investors' concern that stock markets are overpriced is misplaced. While some stocks are grossly over-valued, the generic market is not, he said. 
The Global Allocation Fund has a trailing one-year return of 16.99% and outperformed Morningstar's U.S. Fund World Allocation category by 13.22%, according to Morningstar data.
The most important thing for equities in this market, Rieder said, is not the price-earnings ratio but the Federal Reserve's bringing the discount rate to zero and its indication that rates will remain there for a long time.
A low discount rate is generally seen as positive for risk because it lowers the threshold to make an investment cash-flow positive. Lowering the risk-free rate - the Fed rate or comparable Treasuries - means that the cost of acquiring capital goes down and makes equities cheaper. 
""You've created explosive upside for where (the) multiple can go,"" Rieder said, referring to any of a number of ratios investors rely on to evaluate stock prices.
The pullback in stocks last week was down to low liquidity conditions and excessive call buying in recent days, which Rieder termed ""pretty extraordinary.""
""Some of that is being unwound pretty quickly,"" he said.
Rieder also sees an attractive opportunity to use options to take advantage of what he considers expensive election-related volatility. He has been selling volatility past the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election to subsidize the purchase of calls that will appreciate in value if the market continues to rise from here. 

""Volatility during election years is always significantly higher. That being said, the markets are paying a lot for it,"" Rieder said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga and two other candidates officially started their campaigns on Tuesday to succeed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as the leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and as premier.
Abe late last month announced he was resigning because of poor health, ending his tenure as Japan's longest-serving prime minister. 
A leadership election is set for Sept. 14 with LDP lawmakers and regional party representatives casting votes. The winner is virtually assured of becoming prime minister because of the LDP's parliamentary majority.
Here is where Suga, a clear frontrunner, stands on some key policies. Former Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba and former Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida are also running. 
ECONOMY 
A longtime lieutenant of Abe, Suga aims to continue the incumbent's hyper-easy monetary policy, stepped-up government spending and structural reforms, dubbed ""Abenomics"". 
""I will keep Abenomics and take it forward,"" Suga, 71, said on Tuesday. 
Announcing his candidacy at a news conference last week, Suga voiced his readiness to have the central bank take additional easing steps to protect jobs, if he were to become prime minister. 
Suga opposes lowering the 10% sales tax rate, which he sees as indispensable to social security reforms. Some lawmakers have proposed lowering the tax to reduce the burden of the coronavirus pandemic on households.
In an interview published in the Nikkei business daily on Saturday, Suga said he would consider compiling another economic stimulus package by the end of the year to ""put the pandemic to an end and shift the economy to a new stage.""
A son of a farmer from northern Japan, Suga counts the revitalisation of the regional economy as one of his key priorities. 
REFORMS 
As a strong proponent of reforms in both the public and private sectors, Suga favours greater consolidation of regional banks and has also reiterated his intention to ask mobile phone carriers to lower fees, which he has advocated during Abe's tenure.
He advocates setting up an agency to promote the government's digital strategies under one roof and said in a recent newspaper interview that he will look into a possible overhaul of the health ministry, which came under fire for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. 
""On becoming the LDP president, I would break down the vertically segmented administrative system, get rid of vested interests ... and do my best to push ahead with regulatory reforms,"" Suga said on Tuesday. 
DIPLOMACY, SECURITY 
Suga regards Japan's alliance with the United States as the mainstay of Tokyo's diplomacy and security, and seeks stable ties with neighbouring countries including China.
Suga told reporters last week that he is willing to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un with no preconditions to help resolve the issue of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea decades ago.
He is for revising the U.S.-drafted pacifist constitution, a much cherished goal of Abe that ultimately eluded the outgoing prime minister. 
Asked about his position on Japan possibly acquiring the capability to strike enemy targets, he said on Tuesday he would first observe ruling party debate, without specifying where he stands on the issue. 
CORONAVIRUS AND BEYOND
Suga aims to boost coronavirus testing capacity and secure enough vaccines for Japan's entire population by the middle of next year. 
He is a strong promoter of tourism as a way to drive local economies and signalled in a recent interview with Reuters the importance of re-opening the economy and also ensuring that the pandemic is contained.
In the interview he also stressed that Japan would do ""whatever it takes"" to ensure it could host the Olympics next year. The event was originally planned for this summer but postponed for a year due to the pandemic. 

On Tuesday, he told a press conference that preventing the spread of the coronavirus will take priority in any decision on holding a snap election.

PARIS (Reuters) - Disruption to schooling stemming from the COVID-19 epidemic will cause a skill loss that could result in a 1.5% drop in global economic output for the rest of this century, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimated.
For the United States, that will represent an economic loss of $15.3 trillion, the OECD said in a report published on Tuesday, with the bill rising higher still if disruption to education extends into the next academic year.
""Learning loss will lead to skill loss, and the skills people have relate to their productivity,"" the report said, explaining the forecast drop in global GDP.
Governments around the world closed schools to curb the spread of COVID-19, in most cases for around 10 weeks, or one third of a year of schooling. 
One impact was to widen the gaps in educational opportunities between the rich and poor. Children with internet access, computers, and supportive families fared better.
""Students from privileged backgrounds ... could find their way past closed school doors to alternative learning opportunities. Those from disadvantaged backgrounds often remained shut out when their schools shut down,"" the report said.
Even as schools in many countries re-open, big challenges remain for education, according to the OECD report. Schools must navigate how to re-open without causing a new spike in infections. 

With economies contracting, there is a risk education budgets will shrink, the report said. And universities will have to reinvent themselves so they stay attractive to students even when they can longer offer the traditional campus experience.

636,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>",Stimulus Stalemate Lingers as Senate Returns to Washington,"(Bloomberg) -- The Senate returns to Washington Tuesday with the Trump administration and Democrats no closer to agreement on a new virus relief package than they were when talks broke off in early August -- despite the pressure of the U.S. election in 56 days.
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will try to break the logjam this week with a scaled-down $500 billion stimulus plan that the White House supports. Although that’s half of what the GOP offered at the end of July, McConnell is struggling to get Republicans fully behind it as newly-energized fiscal hawks in the party balk at adding to the estimated $3.3 trillion fiscal 2020 deficit.
“I hope by the end of the week, we can begin moving forward with that,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday on Fox News. He called the smaller measure “targeted.”
The skinny -- or targeted -- stimulus has already been panned by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats. They haven’t budged from their proposal for a $2.2 trillion relief package that Republicans previously rejected.
In the middle of that, both parties will be negotiating a stopgap spending measure to prevent a government shutdown when the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. Pelosi and Mnuchin have agreed they don’t want the stimulus impasse to hinder work on the stopgap.
Meanwhile, there may be agitation among rank-and-file lawmakers facing voters on Nov. 3 to include some economic relief.
McConnell on Friday said he wanted to get another relief package through Congress but that it will be “exceedingly difficult because of the proximity to the election.”
Friday’s monthly jobs report from the Labor Department, which showed the unemployment rate fell by almost 2 percentage points in August to 8.4%, also eased some of the pressure on Republicans to move closer to the plan proposed by Democrats.
Still, it didn’t fully erase concerns about the economy. Payrolls remain about 11.5 million below the pre-pandemic level, and the number of permanent job losers rose from last month by more than half a million to 3.41 million. A host of companies, from airlines to casinos to the beverage sector, have announced plans to cut workers that were initially furloughed.Ryan Sweet, head of monetary policy research at Moody’s Analytics Inc., said the U.S. needs to maintain job gains, “but without fiscal stimulus that will be hard to do.” Several Federal Reserve officials have hammered that point in recent weeks.
Powell Tells NPR Economy Has Long Road Ahead After Jobs Gain
GOP senators plan to meet Wednesday behind closed doors to discuss whether to try to get a vote on a smaller relief package. That would allow vulnerable Senate Republicans up for re-election to say they tried to provide economic relief, despite Democratic opposition, when they head home to campaign.
The scaled-back plan would provide a $300-per-week unemployment benefits enhancement, $105 billion for schools, a $10 billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service, funding for the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, $45 billion to the Department of Health and Human Services for vaccines and testing needs, and liability protections for employers.
It wouldn’t include another round of $1,200 checks to individuals -- something that President Donald Trump wants -- or any aid to state and local governments, a key demand of Democrats, according to a Senate Republican aide said.
Spending Concerns
Pennsylvania GOP Senator Pat Toomey, a skeptic about the benefits of another massive stimulus program, said it would be good if they can reach a consensus, but he wants something substantially below the $1 trillion originally offered by McConnell.
“I’m not a fan of a lot more spending,” Toomey said.
It’s unclear if McConnell can marshal a 51-vote majority even for the smaller proposal. He’s previously said that as many 20 Senate Republicans are against any additional spending.
Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska told reporters Friday that Republicans have had daily conference calls with Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.
“We’ll see if we’re able to get something put together,” she said of a new stimulus proposal. Asked whether Republicans will all agree, she said, “I don’t speak for my colleagues.”
If McConnell tries to bring the skinny bill up, it will be a mere exercise in party messaging. It would need 60 votes to advance and it almost certainly would be blocked by Senate Democrats, who have 43 votes in the chamber.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has made clear his opposition.
“Republicans may call their proposal ‘skinny,’ but it would be more appropriate to call it ‘emaciated,”’ he wrote in a Thursday letter.
Election Pressure
The looming election will create pressure points for Trump as well as for incumbents in the House and Senate. The White House is pushing for stimulus payments for individuals to go out before the Nov. 3 election.
“Look, nobody wants to give direct payments to American families more than President Donald Trump,” Vice President Mike Pence said on CNBC Friday.
Immediately before their August break, two Senate Republicans trailing their Democratic challengers in polls -- Susan Collins of Maine and Martha McSally of Arizona -- helped introduce a bill that has a higher unemployment benefits enhancement than the one in the scaled-down proposal.
In the House, meanwhile, Democrats from swing districts are poised to increase their pressure on Pelosi to get a deal. The moderate Blue Dog Coalition sent the Speaker a letter on Aug. 21 urging compromise, and vulnerable first-term Iowa Democrat Cindy Axne followed up last week with a letter demanding action on a smaller package.
A key decision for Pelosi and other Democratic leaders is the timetable for a temporary government spending resolution.
Mnuchin said Sunday his expectation is that a stopgap deal would run through the beginning of December, although specifics have not been ironed out.
“The most important thing is to make sure at the end of the month, we don’t shutdown the government and we get something past the election.”
But some Democrats are pushing for a stopgap into early 2021, to avoid the possibility of having to negotiate with a lame-duck president if Trump loses.
“Frankly, shutting down the government in November and December is a far more acceptable risk for them -- if the scenario is they lose the White House and Senate majority in January,” Democratic Representative Gerry Connolly of Virginia said of Republicans.
Connolly said Democrats lost leverage by agreeing to keep the stopgap bill and stimulus talks separate.
Connecticut Democratic Representative Jim Himes said he thinks Trump ultimately will push to get a deal done with Democrats later in the month if he’s still trailing Democrat Joe Biden in polls.
“The president of the United States understands one thing and perhaps one thing only, and that is what is good for him personally,” he said. “And it is good for him personally to get some kind of a deal done.”

637,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>","UberEats, Deliveroo workers drive French surge in new companies","PARIS (Reuters) - Food delivery workers fuelled an unexpected jump in the number of new companies created in France in June and July, French commercial court data showed on Tuesday, though almost all other industries suffered due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Ubiquitous on bikes across Paris and other French cities, the number of self-employed riders delivering food for services like Deliveroo, Just Eat (AS:TKWY) or UberEats shot up when consumers were homebound during a two-month lockdown.
Many registered as companies once crisis restrictions eased, according to data from France's commercial court clerks council CNGTC, which showed the number of new transport businesses jumping 29% in June and July from a year earlier. 
That pushed up the overall number of newly-registered companies by 10% in those two months, although for the third quarter as a whole including May, registrations were down 5.5%, the data compiled by research firm Xerfi I+C showed. 
While providing one bright spot as France braces for one of Europe's worst economic slumps, the deliveries boom has also revived concerns over a ""gig economy"" model at odds with the level of welfare afforded to workers in other sectors.
It also contrasts with a worsening outlook for hotel owners, restaurants, retailers and companies in real estate or construction. The number of new company registrations fell in those sectors in the period. 
Bankruptcy filings and requests for creditor protection were also down on a year earlier, by 42.5%, despite the economic shock dealt by the lockdown. 
""The measures put in place by the government have prevented a wave of insolvencies,"" said CNGTC head Sophie Jonval. The third and fourth quarters would be a greater test of companies' financial health, she added. 
In addition to a 300 billion euro ($354.5 billion) state-backed loan programme, the French government is going to guarantee 3 billion euros in quasi-equity loans to small businesses under its new recovery plan, which can be leveraged to 15 billion in order to shore up balance sheets.

638,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 04:00AM ET</span>",German economy minister sceptical about Russia sanctions,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier has questioned whether imposing sanctions on countries like Russia are effective, as a debate rages over whether to suspend the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany over the poisoning of a Kremlin critic.
Speaking on an ARD talk show, Altmaier condemned the poisoning of Alexei Navalny as a ""cowardly assassination attempt on a Russian citizen in Russia"" and said the circumstances must be cleared up.
He did not rule out imposing sanctions at some point in the future, but added he believed keeping open communication lines can sometimes be more effective.
""We need to clarify what we are trying to achieve with our sanctions. Is it just a matter of looking in the mirror or is it something positive for human rights?"" he said late on Monday evening.
From his experience in politics, sanctions often lead to a ""hardening of politics,"" Altmaier added.
""I don't know of any case where a country like Russia, or a similar country, has been moved by sanctions to change its behaviour in the past.""
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is under mounting pressure from members of her conservative party to suspend the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a huge project to double Russian gas exports to Germany that is more than 90% complete and due to start operating from early 2021.
On Monday, her spokesman said she did not rule out imposing sanctions.
But the head of the German Eastern Business Association told Deutschlandfunk radio on Tuesday it would be almost impossible to halt the project from a legal perspective.

""Legally, I think that is hardly possible. All permits have been granted, the contracts are watertight - not only in Germany, but also in five countries plus under European regulations,"" Michael Harms said.

For Germany the decision should be a “no brainer” to pull out of the project, which was political and destabilizing for eastern Europe, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said in an interview on Monday.
Hours earlier, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman indicated that she was rethinking her sustained support for the controversial Baltic Sea pipeline.
“With the recent developments in Belarus, where Mr. Putin is clearly threatening with intervention, and what he did with Mr. Navalny, this should be a final wake up call for Germany,” Morawiecki told Bloomberg Television. Russia should be condemned and “there should be very strong sanctions and interventions following suit.”

640,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 08, 2020 03:00AM ET</span>",The Year That Crippled Global Trade Still Poses Five Big Risks,"(Bloomberg) --
This year could end today and it would still rival the most challenging periods for the international trading system. But the next 3 1/2 months may bring even more potential disruptions that could secure 2020’s spot as the most turbulent in modern history.
Several key events will occur that have potential to turbo-charge the global trade regime’s trajectory toward dysfunction and chaos. On the flip side, it’s possible the outcomes could help cushion the worst global recession since the financial crisis and set the world on a path to recovery.
“There’s no question that the next three months will be pivotal for the state of global trade,” said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. With protectionism on the rise in ways similar to the lead-up to the Great Depression, “the echoes of the 1930s are pretty clear,” he said.
As summer winds down, here are five key political and economic events affecting trade in the remainder of the year:
1) WTO Aircraft Dispute
A panel of three World Trade Organization arbiters will soon determine whether and how much the European Union can retaliate against the U.S. for its illegal subsidies to Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.
While the EU has asked the WTO for authorization to impose levies on $11.2 billion of U.S. products, those close to the case say the figure is likely to be lower -- perhaps much lower than the WTO’s $7.5 billion award to the U.S. in its parallel dispute against EU subsidies to Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY).
Why the Boeing vs. Airbus Fight Is Coming to a Head: QuickTake
There are hopes the ruling, which could come in a matter of weeks, could spur the U.S. to restart negotiations to settle the 15-year-old dispute. A settlement would be a huge relief to European exporters, who are currently facing stiff U.S. retaliatory tariffs, and for U.S. industries that could soon find themselves on the receiving end of WTO-authorized EU tariffs.
2) The U.S. Presidential Election
Arguably the most important trade development this year is the possibility that Americans deliver President Donald Trump a second term.
If Trump is re-elected in November, it’s likely the U.S. will increase tariffs on foreign trade partners as a means to reshore and diversify America’s supply chains -- particularly for medical goods.
Read More: Trump Vows to Sharply Scale Back U.S. Economic Ties With China
As Trump highlighted at a press conference Monday, a second term would almost certainly see an escalation in America’s geopolitical fight with China, which Trump blames for spreading the Covid-19 pandemic and American economic misery.
“If Trump wins, expect more of the same -- a roller coaster ride of volatility, threats, and tariffs,” said William Reinsch, a trade official in the Clinton administration and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. If Democrat Joe Biden wins, “he has already said, in effect, that trade is going to be on the back burner while he deals with the pandemic and the economy.”
3) WTO Leadership Race
In the midst of all this, members of the WTO will endeavor to select a new leader to help revive the neutered referee for international commerce. The organization is currently operating without a chief following Roberto Azevedo’s early departure on Aug. 31 and the vacuum at the top couldn’t have come at a worse time.
The WTO’s dispute-settlement function is crippled, its negotiating arm is essentially frozen and the organization is beginning to buckle beneath the pressure of the U.S.-China battle for trade supremacy.
Who Will Lead the WTO and Help It Avoid Collapse?: QuickTake
The WTO’s complex and opaque deliberations are led by a “troika” of trade ambassadors who hold “confessionals” with each of the WTO’s 164 members in order to select a consensus winner.
The race itself is fiercely competitive, punctuated by nationalistic aspirations, and subject to spin and political chicanery. If WTO members are unable to select a leader by consensus, a vote requiring a qualified majority could be held as a last resort -- which would be unprecedented in the organization’s 25-year history.
“The WTO is in a difficult spot and would benefit tremendously from a reformer who is willing to push countries for change,” said Clete Willems, partner at Akin Gump and a former Trump administration official.
4) Digital Sales-Tax Fight
The U.S. and European policy makers are sleepwalking toward a damaging trade conflict over foreign taxes on U.S. technology companies like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google.
On one hand, cash-strapped governments in Europe and elsewhere are pursuing new digital sales-tax rules on foreign companies that generate huge revenues in their jurisdictions. But the Trump administration argues such taxes unfairly discriminate against American firms and is threatening retaliatory tariffs that could exacerbate the pain of the global recession.
Why ‘Digital Taxes’ Are the New Trade War Flashpoint: QuickTake
Though nations have sought to resolve the matter at the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the U.S. withdrew from those talks in June. If an agreement is not forthcoming this year America’s top trade official has pledged to impose tariffs on nearly a dozen nations in 2021.
5) Brexit
New and significant trade barriers between the U.K. and European Union are coming at year-end. That’s because the U.K. is leaving the EU’s single market and customs union -- meaning British exporters must endure new customs paperwork that will create border queues and persistent delays.
Read More: Boris Johnson’s Taste for Brexit Danger Could Doom EU Trade Deal
This will happen regardless of whether Britain can come to an agreement with the European trading bloc over the future of their economic relationship. If the U.K. fails to negotiate a tariff- and quota-free accord with the EU, British exports will become subject to WTO negotiated terms that bring costs, controls and red tape that haven’t existed for decades.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy sank deeper into its worst postwar contraction in the second quarter as the coronavirus jolted businesses more than initially thought, underscoring the daunting task the new prime minister faces in averting a steeper recession.
Other data put that challenge in perspective, with household spending and wages falling in July as the impact of the pandemic kept consumption frail even after lockdown measures were lifted in May.
The world's third-largest economy shrank an annualised 28.1% in April-June, more than a preliminary reading of a 27.8% contraction, revised gross domestic product (GDP) data showed on Tuesday, suffering its worst postwar contraction.
The data will put the new prime minister, to be elected in a ruling party leadership race on Sept. 14, under pressure to take bolder economic support measures.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, the frontrunner to become next premier, has signalled his readiness to boost spending if he were to lead the country.
""The risk ahead is that the effect of measures taken so far, such as pay-outs to households, will peter out,"" said Koichi Fujishiro, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""If COVID-19 weighs heavily on wages, the new administration could take additional steps to help households.""
The government has so far unveiled a $2 trillion package of stimulus measures, adding to an enhanced easing programme from the Bank of Japan (BOJ).
Japan recently saw a renewed rise in infections but has been spared the kind of big casualties seen in western countries. Total infections stood at 72,321 as of Monday, with 1,380 deaths versus a global tally of over 27 million cases and more than 888,000 deaths.
The main culprit behind Tuesday's downward GDP revision was a 4.7% drop in capital expenditure, much bigger than a preliminary 1.5% fall, suggesting the pandemic was hitting broader sectors of the economy.
""We can't expect capital expenditure to strengthen much ahead. Companies won't boost spending when the outlook is so uncertain,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
Japan's economy has shown some signs of life after suffering three straight quarters of contraction, with factory output rising in July at the fastest pace on record thanks to rebounding demand for automobiles.
Yet separate data on Tuesday suggested any recovery will likely be modest, as household spending fell a bigger-than-expected 7.6% in July year-on-year, while real wages declined for the fifth straight month, pointing to more pressure on consumer spending.
BROAD IMPACT
The health crisis has ravaged a broad array of sectors, with firms such as automaker Honda Motor Co (T:7267) forecasting a 68% decrease in annual operating profit.
Analysts polled by Reuters in August said they expect the economy to shrink 5.6% in the current fiscal year to next March, and grow just 3.3% the following year.
The fresh batch of data will be among factors the BOJ will scrutinise at its rate review next week, when it is widely expected to keep monetary settings unchanged.
The central bank eased policy twice this year to pump money to cash-strapped small firms, complementing two big government spending packages.
The BOJ is widely expected to hold off on ramping up stimulus for now as steps to spur demand could get people moving more freely into shops and risk spreading the virus. 
The global and domestic business climate has many Japan observers predicting a long and bumpy road to returning the economy to pre-COVID levels.

""It will probably take a long time for the economy to normalise and return to levels before the pandemic,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.

Chinese banks are estimated to have issued 1.22 trillion yuan ($178.48 billion) in net new yuan loans last month, compared with 992.7 billion yuan in July, according to the median estimate in a Reuters survey of 35 economists.
That would be largely in line with the 1.21 trillion yuan tally a year earlier.
Broad M2 money supply growth in August was seen at 10.7%, matching previous month's pace.
Annual outstanding yuan loans were expected to grow 13.0% for August, again the same as for July.
Chinese authorities have urged banks to offer cheaper loans and cut fees to help struggling businesses hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Premier Li Keqiang has said that growth in M2 - a broad gauge of money supply - and total social financing will be significantly higher this year.
Early August data suggested the world's second-biggest economy has largely managed to bounce back from the coronavirus crisis, with exports rising at their quickest pace in over a year even though weakness in imports pointed to soft domestic demand.
China's policymakers reiterated recently a flexible and targeted approach to monetary policy and said fiscal policy would be more proactive, indicating to many analysts that Beijing has shifted from its emergency stimulus mode to more targeted measures. [nL4N2FR1AL]
Analysts with Capital Economics expected the issuance of corporate bonds to have eased slightly in August. But other forms of non-bank financing are likely to have picked up, including government bonds and equity.
They also noted the pick-up in shadow credit in July suggested that regulators may have relaxed their grip on the shadow banking sector. 
In August, the total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity, was expected to have risen to 2.73 trillion yuan from 1.69 trillion yuan in July.
""Credit growth may edge up further in August and September before softening in Q4,"" said economists with UBS, who expected China's macro policy stance to remain supportive in the rest of 2020, but with low incentive to ease further.

The central bank identified 26 sectors affected by the pandemic such as auto, aviation and tourism, which can be offered a resolution subject to criteria including debt-coverage ratio, outstanding liabilities and a company’s net worth before the virus.
“The compliance in regard to meeting the agreed ratios must be monitored as financial covenants on an ongoing basis, and during subsequent credit reviews,” the RBI said in a statement on Monday. “Any such breach not rectified within a reasonable period, in terms of the loan contract, will be considered as financial difficulty.”
Banking shares were little changed at 9.30am in Mumbai in line with the broader Sensex index.
Veteran Banker
India’s central bank had allowed banks to alter the terms of loans for cash-strapped borrowers hit by the fallout of the pandemic, including longer repayment times and an extended freeze on repayments. Under the new measures, lenders don’t have to classify restructured loans as bad debt for up to two years. The RBI also formed a 5-member panel headed by veteran banker K V Kamath to come up with specific financial parameters to resolve large covid-affected accounts.
“Financial parameters like debt servicing ratio and net worth of a company pre-Covid are a reasonable matrix to ensure that only genuine companies, which were affected by the pandemic will be eligible for debt restructuring,” said Siddharth Purohit, an analyst at SMC Global Securities Ltd. “This won’t give an escape clause to companies which were already in trouble before Covid. In that sense the norms are simple, reasonable and will help the companies in real trouble.”
The regulator last month gave lenders the power to restructure certain loans, replacing a six-month moratorium that ended on Aug. 31. Only loans that were performing as of March will be eligible for restructuring.
QuickTake on India’s plan to tackle $140 billion in bad loans
India Ratings, the local arm of Fitch, estimates that 8% of outstanding loans could be restructured. As much as half of India’s loans could end up being classified as non-performing debt, according to Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc, which also expects problem loans to rise to 17-19% by March 2021. The central bank, meanwhile, expects the bad loan ratio to rise to 12.5% by March, up from 8.5% a year earlier, and the highest level since 2000.

BALI, Indonesia/BANGKOK (Reuters) - A spike in coronavirus infections in Indonesia's holiday island of Bali and Thailand's first locally transmitted case in 100 days have dealt further blows to Southeast Asian hopes of reviving vital tourism industries.
Plans to reopen Bali to foreign tourists from September have been postponed indefinitely, while Thailand's proposal for the cautious reopening of Phuket island has come into doubt.
As well as trying to encourage domestic tourism industries, some Southeast Asian countries have been considering ""travel bubbles"" with others as a way to get businesses restarted.
Bali initially appeared to weather the health crisis better than other parts of Indonesia, which has suffered Southeast Asia's biggest death toll by far. But coronavirus cases have spiked after it reopened its borders to domestic tourism at the end of July.
""Increasing domestic tourism is one important factor for increasing cases in Bali,"" said Dr Pandu Riono, an epidemiologist from the University of Indonesia.
While Ketut Suarjaya, the head of Bali's health agency, said domestic tourism was not to blame for the spike in cases, others see Bali's experience as a warning of the dangers of reopening borders too soon.
Epidemiologists and public health experts said the arrival of tourists in Bali not only made infection from other parts of Indonesia more likely, but underscored the country's shortcomings in tackling the pandemic, namely a lack of testing and contract tracing.
Public health experts also said another likely contributing factor was the arrival of the more infectious mutation of the virus, known as D614G.
Bali posted a record 196 coronavirus cases on Friday, the fifth consecutive daily record. Daily cases in the holiday island almost tripled on average over the past six weeks, while the death tally doubled to 116 over that period.
Bali souvenir shop owner Kamil, who goes only by one name as is common in Indonesia, said he still wasn't doing much business but tried not to get too stressed.
""I just leave it to God because we cannot predict the future,"" he said. ""All we can do now is run the business according to health protocols.""
ECONOMIC FALLOUT
Indonesia's economy had its first quarterly contraction in over two decades in the second quarter - with Bali's economy shrinking even more than the rest of the country at nearly 11%.
Thailand, where foreign visitor spending made up over 11% of GDP last year, has been even harder hit by the collapse in tourism despite better managing the pandemic - also contracting the most since the Asian financial crisis in the second quarter.
The country suspended plans for a ""travel bubble"" agreement with select countries in August as new daily coronavirus cases rose in parts of Asia.
Yuthasak Supasorn, governor of the official Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), said the cautious reopening of Phuket to foreign tourists would likely be delayed until after the planned start date of Oct. 1.
Yuthasak told Reuters he hoped it would still start during Europe's winter - Thailand's tourist high season.
Vietnam's local tourism reopening, after initially clearing itself of the virus, also took a knock when a new outbreak was discovered in the resort city of Danang in July, forcing it to go under a strict lockdown that was only lifted on Monday.
Back in Indonesia, Kamil said he remained positive as long as his shop stayed open.

""Maybe there will be a customer,"" he said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico has raised a non-binding limit for gross debt to 70% of gross domestic product (GDP), almost 20 percentage points above last year's level, for the remaining four years of the term of its fiscally conservative president. 
Mexico's debt to GDP ratio is closely watched by ratings agencies, which this year stripped national oil company Petroleos Mexicanos of its investment grade rating and who warn that the nation's sovereign rating could be next.
Ratings agencies have cited the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, interest rate changes and a depreciation of the peso as the main risk factors for further downgrades. 
Charles Seville, head of North American sovereign ratings at Fitch Ratings, said a further downgrade will depend in part on how much the government deviates from its fiscally conservative course.
""There are several triggers, one is if indeed the debt to GDP ratio continues to rise or we believe it is going to continue to rise. And that could result from either policies or the evolution of the virus and the economy from here. So that's pretty important.""
Mexico had a gross debt to GDP ratio of 60.2% updated to June, about 10 percentage points above the level at the close of 2019, official statistics show. In a document issued after the president's state of union address last week, the government revealed the new upper limit of 70%. 
The limit is not legally binding.
The Mexican finance ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said his government's decision to avoid debt-fueled economic stimulus meant the country had healthy finances.
Lopez Obrador also promises an austere 2021 budget - due to be presented to Congress by the finance ministry late on Tuesday.
""Last year, we didn't increase debt and that helped us,"" Lopez Obrador said during a regular news conference, adding that the ratio had increased because of the economic contraction and a weaker peso. 
The central bank predicts the economy will contract by almost 13% because of the pandemic. 

""Because of the pandemic, it was no longer possible to maintain the same level of debt but we'll recover and grow,"" Lopez Obrador said.

Haldane told City A.M. newspaper that the ""recovery isn't being given enough credit"" and the economy ""has bounced back"" in large part because consumers had shown themselves to be ""incredibly resilient and adaptive and so too have businesses.""
Fellow interest-rate setters Michael Saunders, Deputy BoE Governor Dave Ramsden and Gertjan Vlieghe have recently expressed concern that Britain's economy might take longer to recover than the BoE's most recent forecasts.
Saunders said last week he thought Britain's economy was likely to need more stimulus from the BoE.
Britain suffered its most severe economic contraction on record between March and June when it shrank by 20%, a worse performance than other large industrialised nations.
Haldane has consistently sounded more optimistic about the prospect of a relatively quick recovery.
He also told City A.M. that calls to extend the British government's huge job retention scheme would prevent a ""necessary process of adjustment"" from taking place in the labour market as some companies looked set to fail.
Haldane told the newspaper in a podcast interview that the pandemic had already delivered ""lasting structural change to the economy which does mean, regrettably, some businesses will probably not make it through and some jobs may well not be coming back."" 

BoE Governor Andrew Bailey has similarly backed finance minister Rishi Sunak's plan to wind down the job retention scheme by the end of next month.

The agency lifted the country's rating to 'CCC+' from the previous 'SD', or selective default, citing the conclusion of ""complex"" foreign and local-law debt restructurings that would significantly reduce coupon payments in the next few years.
""This important step forward provides the opportunity for the government to articulate a broader plan to tackle various post-pandemic macroeconomic challenges,"" it said.
Argentina has over the last week restructured around $65 billion in foreign bonds and over $40 billion in foreign currency debt issued under local law, a big win for the country that has been mired in recession and default.
The grains producer now has to turn its attentions to negotiating a new deal with the International Monetary Fund to replace a failed $57 billion credit facility from 2018 and to hold talks with the Paris Club groups of lenders.
It is also facing its third straight year of recession with forecasts for a 12% contraction this year, high inflation, draining reserves and rising pressure on the peso currency.
S&P gave Argentina a ""stable"" outlook, though the agency said it could downgrade the country again if any ""unexpected negative political developments undermine prospects for economic recovery and for some reversal of the fiscal deterioration in 2020.""
""This scenario could damage fragile local investor confidence in particular and hamper access to peso-denominated debt markets,"" the ratings agency said.

(Reuters) - From Georgia to Wisconsin to Ohio earlier this year, voters in primary elections were stuck for hours in lines from sharply reduced polling locations. And the surge in absentee ballots due to concerns over the coronavirus pandemic overwhelmed election officials.
Heeding the stark warning ahead of Election Day on Nov. 3, U.S. companies are aiming to facilitate what is expected to be a chaotic 2020 U.S. presidential election. Twitter (N:TWTR) and Apple (O:AAPL) are giving workers paid time off to get to ballot boxes. Starbucks (O:SBUX) and The Gap's (N:GPS) Old Navy are urging staff to volunteer at local polling stations.
Nearly 800 companies including  Nike  (N:NKE), healthcare company  Abbott Laboratories  (N:ABT) and technology company Qualcomm (O:QCOM) are participating in a CEO-led bipartisan activist group called Time to Vote, which encourages companies to give employees at least a few hours off to vote. 
Starbucks Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said last month that people could work out with managers when they can head to polls, adding that the move is partly motivated by concerns about Black voter suppression. Starbucks is also urging its over 200,000 U.S. employees register to vote from its mobile app.
“We know that barriers exist, notably in Black and Brown communities throughout the nation, that lend to systemic racism and require greater voter access and protections,” Johnson said in an internal memo on Aug. 27. “No (employee) will have to choose between working their shift or voting on or before Election Day.”
Rules securing time off for workers to vote vary by state. In New York, workers can be paid for up to two hours to vote, but they may be required to give advance notice. In Alabama, workers get one hour of unpaid time.
“Voting is always important, but the degree of partisan polarization this year seems to be extraordinarily high. This makes the stakes of the election unusually high as well,” said Jonathan Entin, professor of political science at Case Western Reserve University.
Partisan battles over expanding mail-in voting amid the pandemic have threatened to snarl the political process where more than a third of registered voters are expected to do so by mail or vote early in person, according to a survey published in August from Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape project.
President Donald Trump for months has railed against voting by mail citing unfounded fraud concerns and last week encouraged supporters to vote twice, once by mail and again in person, compounding the confusion ahead of Election Day.
Nearly half of voters fear difficulties with voting in the U.S. presidential elections, according to a voter survey by Pew Research.
Companies including  Tiffany & Co  (N:TIF), Levi Strauss (N:LEVI) and Walmart (N:WMT) have offered paid time off or flexible hours to workers.
“If any employee needs extra time to vote or work at the polls, they can simply work with their managers on creating a flexible schedule,” a spokesman for packaged food company Conagra Brands (N:CAG) said.
Some companies, including Kraft Heinz (O:KHC) and  Target  (N:TGT), have also set up websites to guide employees on registering to vote and learning about candidates in partnership with the League of Women Voters and the National Association of Manufacturers.
Several states have warned in recent months that they may not have enough poll workers, with Maryland at one point estimating it was short 14,000 people. In response, companies including Target and The Gap have offered paid time off to volunteer as poll workers. Poll sites are expected to fall short of volunteers as older people who are more at risk to COVID-19 infection have typically staffed sites and are expected to stay home.
The two companies have joined 150 others including Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and Etsy (O:ETSY) to help sign up 350,000 new volunteers through a corporate-led campaign called the Civic Alliance. The group says on its website that its goal is to drive historic voter turnout in 2020.

The median forecast of 16 analysts surveyed was for inflation to reach 4.02%, up from 3.62% in July. That would take the rate to its highest level since May 2019. 
Mexico's central bank, which has cut its benchmark lending rate by 375 basis points since August last year to 4.5%, targets consumer price inflation of 3%, with a one percentage point tolerance band above or below that figure.

652,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>","No Nord Stream 2? No problem for Germany, economists say","By Vera Eckert, Paul Carrel and Tom Käckenhoff
FRANKFURT/BERLIN/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Abandoning the nearly complete Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany could create a legal mess and nudge up energy costs for European households but Germany would cope with any disruption to supplies, economists say.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas at the weekend questioned the project -- thus far supported by Germany -- following the suspected poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman reinforced the shift in tone on Monday, saying she shared the view of Maas, who told newspaper Bild am Sonntag: ""I certainly hope that the Russians will not force us to change our position on Nord Stream 2.""
Their comments cast doubt over the future of a project that is more than 90% complete, scheduled to operate from early 2021 and which would double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany, Europe's largest economy.
Knocking out that additional capacity would put upward pressure on gas prices. But reduced energy demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and slack in the German economy, would give Berlin time to work out alternative additional supply sources.
""Germany could easily afford it,"" Berenberg Bank economist Holger Schmieding said of the possibility of axing the pipeline, describing the impact on economic output as ""negligible"".
""We have time anyway, and now with GDP only to reach pre-pandemic levels in 2022, in a way we have more time to figure out how to grapple with it than we had before,"" he said.
Navalny was airlifted to Germany for hospital treatment after falling ill on a Russian domestic flight last month. The German government says he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent similar to the one used in an attempt to kill a former Russian spy in England two years ago.
Moscow says it has seen no evidence he was poisoned.
Merkel, who had until now been unwavering in her support for Nord Stream 2, wants to agree a response to the affair with Germany's European Union partners and is first awaiting an explanation from Russia.
TRADE-OFFS
Merkel and the EU face a trade-off between the economic benefits of the pipeline and the firm political message that abandoning it would send to Russia, analysts say.
""Merkel's perhaps deliberate opening of the domestic debate underlines that Berlin's support for pragmatic dialogue with Putin is not for free,"" said Carsten Nickel at Teneo, a consultancy. 
Germany could use the threat of an exit from the project to try to get more engagement from Russian President Vladimir Putin on issues such as Ukraine or Belarus, he said.
But with 2,300 km of the 2,460 km twin-pipeline length completed, the commercial momentum behind the project may well carry it through.
A study undertaken in April by Cologne University's energy economics institute (EWI) showed that consumers would benefit from a 5% gas price discount if Nord Stream 2 materialized.
There is strong commercial resistance to axing the project. Oliver Hermes, chairman of the Ost-Ausschuss, which represents German business interests in Russia, said abandoning it would damage Germany's commercial reputation.
""This would place a considerable burden on the image of the EU and Germany as a safe investment location,"" he said.
German gas stocks were filled to 93.2% capacity on Saturday, data from European infrastructure group GIE showed, more than enough to cope with the immediate challenge of heating Germans' homes this winter. 
But sourcing alternative energy supplies in the longer term - potentially from U.S. fracking gas, liquid gas from Russia and Qatar, or additional pipeline gas - would cost ""billions of euros per year, which European consumers in particular would then have to pay,"" Hermes said.
The legal costs of abandoning Nord Stream 2 could also prove a major headache. The five Western partners in the 9.5 billion euro project led by Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) would suffer massive writedowns should it be axed.

Half a dozen people familiar with the industry said pulling the plug would provoke a backlash from among the 120 firms involved in the project. Two of the people, including a specialist energy lawyer, forecast a raft of lawsuits.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union told Britain on Monday that there would be no trade deal if it tried to tinker with the Brexit divorce treaty, raising the prospect of a tumultuous end-of-year finale to the saga.
In yet another twist to the four-year saga since Britain voted to quit the EU, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government was reported to be planning new legislation to override parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement it signed in January.
That could jeopardize the whole treaty and create frictions in British-ruled Northern Ireland, where special arrangements had been made to avoid a hard border with Ireland to the south that could be detrimental to the 1998 peace agreement which ended three decades of conflict in the province.
""I trust the British government to implement the Withdrawal Agreement, an obligation under international law & prerequisite for any future partnership,"" said Ursula von der Leyen, head of the EU executive.
""Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland is essential to protect peace and stability on the island & integrity of the single market."" 
Britain said it would honor the deal and was simply offering clarifications to avoid any future legal difficulties.
But the Financial Times newspaper cited three people as saying the proposed internal market bill was expected to ""eliminate the legal force of parts of the withdrawal agreement"" in areas including state aid and Northern Ireland customs.
EU diplomats were aghast, cautioning that such a step, leaked on the eve of new talks in London, would tarnish Britain's global prestige and heighten chances of a tumultuous final disentangling from the bloc on Dec. 31.
Sterling  fell against the dollar and euro.[nL8N2G418R]
'REASONABLE STEPS'
Britain said it was committed to the divorce deal.
""We are taking limited and reasonable steps to clarify specific elements of the Northern Ireland Protocol in domestic law to remove any ambiguity and to ensure the government is always able to deliver on its commitments,"" a spokesman for Johnson said.
It could not allow the peace process or the internal British market to inadvertently be compromised, he said.
Britain left the EU on Jan. 31 but talks on a new trade deal before the end of a status-quo transition arrangement in December have snagged on state aid rules and fishing. 
London has set a deadline of Oct. 15 to strike a deal.
""If we can't agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on,"" Johnson said on Monday.
Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed on Monday that talks on a Brexit deal needed to make progress this month and reach a conclusion quickly, Johnson's office said.
European diplomats said Britain was playing a game of Brexit chicken by threatening to collapse the process and challenging Brussels to compromise first. Some fear Johnson may view a no-deal exit as useful distraction from the coronavirus crisis.
Some Brexit-supporting members of the ruling Conservatives oppose the withdrawal agreement as threatening British independence even if the two sides secure future trade ties.
'GAMESMANSHIP'?
There was surprise and anger on both sides of the Irish border and in Brussels at the reported plan to undermine the withdrawal pact.
Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney asked: ""Is this political gamesmanship or is there really a piece of legislation that's going to emerge this week, which is contrary to the withdrawal agreement? We'll have to wait and see.""
Without a deal, about $900 billion annual trade between Britain and the EU could be thrown into uncertainty, including rules on everything from car parts and medicines to fruit and data.

EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier acknowledged anxiety but declined to comment on the FT report. ""I remain worried...the negotiations are difficult, because the British want the best of both worlds,"" he told France Inter radio.

LONDON (Reuters) - Economists stuck to their forecasts on Monday that Britain and the European Union would agree some sort of post-Brexit trade deal, taking the view that London is likely toughening its rhetoric in a bid to pressure Brussels into a compromise.
The talks are back in crisis and the pound is bearing the brunt on renewed fears of a disorderly exit from the EU after the British government was reported to be planning legislation to override parts of the Withdrawal Agreement it signed in January. 
""Rhetoric in past few days has been ramped up, but we don't think this materially changes the prospect of a deal being reached before the end of the year"", Chris Graham (NYSE:GHM), Europe Economist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), said.
He added his team was sticking to probabilities of a deal at 50%, no-deal at 30% and an extension of the talks to 20%.
Petr Krpata, Chief EMEA FX and IR Strategist at ING, also stuck to his overall forecast.
""Yes, the latest developments definitely increased the chance of a no-deal Brexit, but still no deal is not our base case,"" he said, giving a 50% to 60% probability to a deal.
Economists at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), Rabobank and Nomura also kept their forecasts that a deal was most likely scenario.
While there is an expectation that Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not go as far as to ""eliminate the legal force of parts of the withdrawal agreement"", a possibility reported by the Financial Times, economists said they had to take that into account. 
""While our base case remains a semi-managed hard exit (60% probability) which involves some modest stop-gap measures to manage the transition from EU to WTO rules for trade, the rising tensions could limit the breadth of any such measures,"" said Kallum Pickering, a senior economist at Berenberg. 
Moving forward however, the perception could quickly deteriorate if London and Brussels keep up their tug of war. 
""It is almost inevitable that the perceived probability of 'no deal' will escalate over the coming weeks"", Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts wrote in a research note this morning in which they maintained their expectations of ""thin"" free trade agreement.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Luxembourg became the first European government to sell a ""sustainability"" bond on Monday, raising 1.5 billion euros ($1.77 billion).
Its choice of a 'sustainability' bond, a blend of 'green' bonds that finance environmentally friendly projects and 'social' bonds that target spending with socially beneficial outcomes, contrasts with that of other European governments.
Like Germany last week, they have sold 'green' bonds in their efforts to fund climate friendly spending and support the development of sustainable finance.
Luxembourg will divide the proceeds equally between green and social projects, a finance ministry spokesperson told Reuters.
With the outbreak of the pandemic, global 'green' bond issuance took a backseat as 'social' bond issuance, especially from development banks, rose sharply.
""We are seeing more interest to go down the social and sustainable route from sovereigns,"" said Trisha Taneja, head of ESG advisory at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which managed the sale together with BCEE, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), BIL and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
Last year Luxembourg launched a 10-step framework to implement the United Nations' 17 sustainable development goals and drafted a climate law to cut greenhouse emissions by 55% until 2030.
""There is no sustainable development if you don't have the social aspects in (the issuance framework) as well,"" the Luxembourg finance ministry spokesperson said.
Still, Luxembourg ranks the lowest among EU countries in making progress to achieve the U.N. goals, according to the 2020 Sustainable Development Report. Significant challenges remain in areas like clean energy and climate action.
At 12.5 billion euros, investors demanded over eight times the amount Luxembourg raised and the bond priced for a yield of -0.123%, lead managers said.
Deutsche's Taneja said Luxembourg's commitment to disclosing alignment with the EU taxonomy on sustainable finance - rules ensuring investments do not prop up pollution - was appreciated by investors.
Luxembourg will also be able to issue standalone green or social bonds via the bond's framework in the future.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy is recovering from the coronavirus shock and will reach its pre-crisis size at the beginning of 2022 at the latest, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told Reuters on Monday but he added more debt was needed to sustain the achieved progress.
The COVID-19 pandemic plunged Europe's largest economy into its deepest recession on record in the first half of the year. Berlin unleashed an unprecedented array of rescue and stimulus measures, financed with record new borrowing of some 218 billion euros, to help companies and consumers get out of the crisis.
""We see that the economic recovery is making headway. That's a good sign,"" Scholz said in the Reuters interview, adding that the economy could also be back to pre-crisis level before 2022 if the recovery was supported in the right way.
Scholz said he was therefore planning to take on new debt to a large extent also next year to sustain the recovery.
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters last week that Scholz is working on a budget for next year that would see Berlin take on net new debt of at least 80 billion euros to fund more measures in the fight against the coronavirus.
""We'll also need a considerable amount of additional borrowing in the next year in order to secure all that we have achieved,"" Scholz said. He declined to give an exact figure.
The step will require another suspension of Germany's constitutionally enshrined debt limits after Berlin already abandoned them this year, though Scholz is determined to stick to the fiscal rules from 2022 onwards.
""Our goal is that from 2022, we will be in a situation where we can pursue a budget policy within the framework of the normal rules of the constitution,"" Scholz said.
""That is precisely the reason why it is so important that we do everything we can this year and next to stabilize the economy. Because our tax revenues also depend on it.""
The comments underline Scholz's determination to move Germany further away from its former image as Europe's austerity champion and cement Berlin's new role as the biggest spender in the euro zone's struggle to recover from the COVID-19 outbreak.

The finance ministry plans to update its tax revenue estimates next week. This will be followed by Scholz's proposal for the federal government's budget in 2021 which the cabinet is expected to pass on Sept. 23.

Moving to electric vehicles from those powered by fossil fuels is central to Denmark's goal of cutting emissions by 70% by 2030 and becoming climate neutral no later than 2050.
However, the Nordic country relies heavily on car and road taxes worth some 50 billion Danish crowns ($7.95 billion) a year, or 2.3% of GDP, to fund its welfare system.
In March, the Danish Council on Climate Change, an independent advisor to the Danish government, said the number of electric cars should rise to at least 1 million by 2030 from less than 20,000 now in order to meet the targets.
""This would create a significant problem for the economy,"" commission head Anders Eldrup told a press briefing.
Increasing the number of electric cars to 1 million through raised subsidies and higher taxes on fossil-fueled cars would result in a total net loss to society of 5.7 billion crowns in 2030, the commission said.
Under the current tax system, proceeds from car and road taxes are already set to drop by 10 billion crowns each year in 2030, it said.
The commission was asked by the government to suggest how to switch from fossil fueled cars to electric cars in the coming decade without jeopardizing the state budget.
The transport sector contributes about 40% of Denmark's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, with less than 1% of cars powered by electricity.
With favorable conditions and early support from the government, Denmark now gets about half of its power from wind turbines and is seen as a pioneer in addressing climate change.

Merkel’s rethinking of her sustained support for the controversial Baltic Sea pipeline underscores the escalating tensions with President Vladimir Putin’s government after German military specialists determined last week that Navalny had been poisoned by novichok, a Russian-developed nerve agent.
The German leader supports statements from Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who over the weekend warned that Berlin could change its backing for the project, Merkel’s chief spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said on Monday. It’s “too early” to determine what the consequences of the chemical attack would be, he added.
“The chancellor also holds the view that it’s wrong to rule something out from the start,” Seibert said at a regular government news conference in Berlin. That marks a shift for Merkel, who said on Aug. 28 that Nord Stream should be completed and remain a separate issue from Navalny.
Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the statement. Earlier, he said that the Kremlin sees no risk that Germany will block Nord Stream. The two leaders haven’t yet spoken about the Navalny case, according to Seibert.
“Any attempts to associate Russia or the Russian leadership with what happened are unacceptable for us, they are absurd,” Peskov said on a conference call. He repeated that the Kremlin is waiting for information about the poisoning from German authorities.
The ruble fell 1% versus the dollar on Monday, the biggest decline among emerging market peers. Shares of Russia’s Gazprom PJSC (OTC:OGZPY) -- which leads the project -- also extended losses, dropping as much as 2% in Moscow trading.
It remains open whether Merkel would pull the plug on the 9.5 billion-euro ($11.2 billion) venture, which is close to completion. Even as her chief spokesman confirmed the shift in sentiment, he offered a standard defense of the pipeline, saying that gas deliveries from the Baltic Sea conduit have been supported by EU gas directives -- and that Nord Stream is only one of several channels for Russian gas, including the Black Sea pipeline TurkStream.
Seibert also noted that gas is considered one of the key energy sources to bridge Germany’s power needs while it phases out coal and nuclear and ramps up renewables.
“The risks are very real,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, head of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, a research group that advises the Kremlin. “It’s clear that Moscow’s behavior won’t change” despite Merkel’s calls for a reaction in the case, he said, adding that “nobody is going to say, sorry, we poisoned Navalny, we won’t do it again.”
Despite the public debate, coalition officials have signaled that there is still little appetite to abandon the project. Critics within Merkel’s Christian Democratic-led bloc have called for measures that fall short of stopping the pipeline, including a moratorium or halting gas flows once it’s completed.
The discussions are even more fraught within Merkel’s coalition partner, the Social Democrats, which have been steadfast in seeking stable ties with Russia. The SPD’s caucus leader, Rolf Muetzenich, said Sunday that invoking specific measures against Moscow “doesn’t help us” -- comments that appeared to rebut Maas, an SPD member.
Merkel last week issued an uncharacteristically sharp rebuke of the Kremlin over the novichok finding and pledged a coordinated response among NATO and EU members.
The political tension caused by Navalny’s poisoning “has led to a very serious discussion in Germany and the EU about problems of our economic cooperation with Russia, including a new critical discussion over the Nord Stream project,” said Michael Harms, head of the German Eastern Business Association. “We need to do everything together to ensure that this trust is not undermined and that it is restored as much as possible”

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson still has reason to pursue a trade agreement with the European Union despite his threat to walk away without one, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
A messy breakup would leave Johnson facing a “triple threat” to his leadership from a stronger Scottish National Party that favors independence, a more popular head of the opposition Labour Party and “a crucial test of competence in the recovery from Covid-19,” Goldman Sachs economist Adrian Paul wrote in a report Monday.
Ending the transition period without a new trade deal in place at the end of the year is becoming more likely. Johnson insists he’s willing to accept that outcome and the economic disruption that comes with it rather than compromise on what he sees as the core principles of Brexit.
Parliament is also preparing legislation that aims to reduce the power of last year’s withdrawal agreement on issues such as state aid, according to a person familiar with the plan.
“This U.K. government might ultimately decide that minimal market access is a price worth paying for maximal regulatory autonomy,” Paul wrote. “From a political perspective, however, the allure of a Brexit deal before the end of a difficult year will be hard to resist.”

Israel and the UAE announced in August they would normalize diplomatic relations in a deal brokered by Washington.
The UAE has since announced it was scrapping an economic boycott on Israel and officials from the two countries have said they were looking at cooperation in defense, energy, medicine, tourism, technology and financial investment.
A number of Israeli and Emirati businesses have signed deals since the normalization accord was announced.‮‮ ‬‬
""Within three to five years trade between Israel and the United Arab Emirates will reach $4 billion,"" Israeli Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen told Israel's Reshet Bet radio station.
A spokesman for Cohen, Israel's former economy minister, said the figure was annual and included defense trade.
Israeli carrier Israir said on Sunday it had reserved slots for commercial flights from Tel Aviv to the UAE, preparing for potential tourism.
The heads of Israel's two biggest banks will travel to the UAE this month, the first such visits since the countries agreed to normalize relations.

661,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 07, 2020 06:41AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday, September 7th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) stock tumbles as reports of its heavy bets on U.S. tech stocks revive fears about its governance and strategy. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is spurned by S&P. Boris Johnson threatens to rip up the U.K.'s Withdrawal Agreement with the EU and put the two on course for a messy end to the Brexit transition period. Chinese exporters had a great month in August, and the ruble weakens as Germany threatens to stop the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline for the first time. Here's what you need to know on Monday, September 7th.
1. Softbank shares tumble after 'Whale' reports
Softbank. (T:9984) shares tumbled 7.2% to their lowest in two months in the wake of a report suggesting that it had been a major player in the wild summer rally in U.S. tech stocks, using options to secure highly leveraged short-term returns.
While most of its trades still appear to be profitable at current levels, the report has revived unease about Softbank’s strategy and governance, threatening the stock’s robust performance since March. It has more than doubled since founder Masayashi Son moved to draw a line under poor investments in WeWork, Uber (NYSE:UBER) and others, and return cash to shareholders.
Having been exposed as the ""Whale"" that has moved the market, Softbank is now a bigger and easier target for others to bet against.
2. Brexit risk is back
Brexit risk is back on the radar after a report that the U.K. government is preparing new legislation that would make the continuation of smooth trade with the EU after the end of this year impossible.
The Financial Times said Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s new plans would revive the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland, scrapping the compromise embedded in last October’s Withdrawal Agreement. The Withdrawal Agreement allowed the U.K. to exit the EU on January without forfeiting any of its access rights to the EU market until the end of 2020.
The EU says that the principles underlying that agreement – including the U.K.’s acceptance of EU rules in a large part of the economy – are a precondition for any future deal on relations between the two. The pound fell 0.8% against the euro but U.K. stocks and bonds were firm.
3. Chinese stocks hit by SMIC report; Europe's gain on rotation hopes 
With U.S. markets closed for the Labor Day holiday, the focus Monday was on Asia and Europe, which largely went their separate ways.
Chinese indexes fell by as much as 2.7% after reports suggesting that the U.S. is looking to impose sanctions on chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International (HK:0981), further tightening restrictions on the Chinese high-technology industry.
That overshadowed numbers showing an extremely strong performance by China’s exporters in August. Exports rose 9.5% on the year, their biggest year-on-year gain since April 2019. Imports, however, fell 2.1% as the country’s refineries and traders dialed down oil purchases after filling their storage tanks at lower prices earlier in the summer.
The export data, and the broader narrative of growth and value stocks coming back to favor in the minds of investors as the tech rally unwinds, pushed European stock markets sharply higher. The Stoxx 600 rose 1.1%, despite the Brexit news and a weak German industrial production report.
4. Musk spurned by S&P
Tesla’s stunning rally this year wasn’t enough to persuade Standard & Poor’s to include it in its benchmark index, the S&P 500.
The committee that governs the index’s composition met on Friday and approved three other new entrants, but held off from the electric carmaker. As is usual, it didn’t explain its selection criteria. Analysts have speculated that the extreme volatility in the shares this year, coupled with the uncertain profitability of its underlying business, could deter S&P from including the stock.
Tesla stock fell 6.3% in after-hours trading on Friday after the announcement. It isn’t trading on Monday due to the Labor Day holiday.
The stock has still more than doubled since June, when speculation on it being included in the index really took off.
5. Germany threatens Nord Stream, and the ruble falls
The Russian ruble weakened and shares in engineering company Saipem fell to their lowest in a year as the furore over poisoned opposition politician Alexey Navalny led the German government to hint for the first time that it would consider abandoning the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project.
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in an interview at the weekend that he ‘hoped’ Germany wouldn’t be forced by the Navalny incident to impose sanctions on the project, which has heavy financial and political backing in Germany, but which is opposed by both the U.S. and many of Germany’s European allies.
Nord Stream 2 is set to carry gas directly from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea,  something that gives Russia more political leverage over transit countries that have carried its gas exports to Europe for the last 40 years – notably Poland and Ukraine. "
662,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",Renault aims to freshen up Dacia's image with model upgrades,"PARIS (Reuters) - French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) unveiled the new lines of two of its best-selling cars on Monday, both models manufactured by its Romanian low-cost brand Dacia, recently upgraded to an independent division within the company.
Under the helm of its new chief executive Luca de Meo, loss-making Renault is trying to recover from the coronavirus pandemic while also patching up a strained relationship with Japanese partner Nissan (T:7201).
The company announced last week a new organization focused on brands rather than geographies, Dacia being one of the four new created divisions alongside the Renault brand, the Alpine sport cars and one dedicated to ""new mobilities"".
The new versions of the Dacia Logan sedan, first launched in 2004, and the city car Sandero, stemming back to 2007, will be presented in detail on Sept. 29.
In an interview with French magazine Le Point published last week, de Meo said Dacia should not depart from its low-cost setting but added the brand should have a ""cooler"" image.

De Meo, who in a previous role at Fiat (MI:FCA) had relaunched the Italian carmaker's signature 500 model, is due to unveil its strategic plan for Renault in January.

663,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2020 03:55AM ET</span>","Graphic: Surging euro, vanishing inflation - Five questions for the ECB","By Dhara Ranasinghe and Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - Thursday's European Central Bank meeting should be anything but dull: the euro is surging, inflation is negative for the first time since 2016 and there is heightened uncertainty about the coronavirus as the number of new cases edges higher.
No major policy moves are expected since the ECB has acted aggressively to shore up an economy tipped to shrink around a tenth in 2020 due to COVID-19.
But pressure to act again soon is rising. Here are five key questions for markets.
1. How dovish will the ECB be?
A negative inflation reading in August points to an explicit dovish bias. Annual euro zone inflation fell to -0.2% from 0.4% in July. Underlying inflation, watched closely by the ECB, tumbled. That suggests the bloc's deepest recession in living memory could become a bigger drag on consumer prices.
Comments last week from ECB board member Isabel Schnabel imply there is no hurry to deliver more stimulus. But weak inflation and a firm euro are fuelling expectations that the ECB will have to expand asset purchases -- possibly in December. 
(Graphic: ECB policy response to the COVID-19 crisis - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklvynjrlpg/ECB0309.PNG) 
2. What about a soaring euro?
Anything ECB chief Christine Lagarde says about the euro's rapid ascent will be watched closely. The currency hit $1.20 for the first time since 2018 last week and has rallied 4% since the July meeting.
On a widely-watched trade-weighted index published by the central bank, the euro is trading near six-year highs, adding to downward pressure on inflation.
ECB chief economist Philip Lane said last week ""the euro-dollar rate does matter"" in a sign that concern about currency strength is growing among rate-setters. 
""The move in the euro has been incredible and the ECB has to respond to this,"" said Jim Caron, a fixed income portfolio manager at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management.
""Do they say something like we're going to intervene? We don't think they'll say that but if they say nothing, the euro's going higher.""
While the ECB has broadly adopted a hands-off approach, it has previously resorted to verbal intervention, such as in 2014. 
(Graphic: Euro during the coronavirus crisis - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegpbobwbvq/Pasted%20image%201599140904172.png)
3. Will the ECB use emergency bond purchases in full?
Euro strength and negative inflation could settle the debate among policymakers about whether the full firepower of the bank's 1.35 trillion euro emergency bond-buying scheme should be deployed. 
Minutes from the July meeting showed some officials were not keen for another increase in the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme. 
Comments from Lane suggest the PEPP, designed to protect the bloc from the coronavirus shock, is also a key tool in boosting inflation towards its near 2% target. Lagarde and Schnabel have said the scheme will be used in full.
Some economists expect the ECB to expand the PEPP by a further 500 billion euros by year-end. 
(Graphic: Will the ECB use the full PEPP envelope? - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklpynjolvg/Pasted%20image%201599141019741.png) 
4. How does the ECB view the economic outlook?
ECB staff projections are due Thursday and the big question is whether new inflation forecasts are below earlier ones. The June forecasts had third-quarter price growth at 0.1% year-on-year and the fourth quarter at 0.0%. 
There are also signs the economic recovery is stuttering after a sharp rebound between May and July. Growth in the dominant service industry almost ground to a halt in August, a survey showed. 
Graphic: Core inflation during crises vs. current ECB projections - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmypmaqwepr/Pasted%20image%201599142128604.png
5. Will the Fed's strategy change impact the ECB?
The Federal Reserve last month unveiled a significant policy shift. It will now target inflation at 2% on average, allowing prices to run hotter to balance periods when they undershoot.
That could have implications for the ECB, which is set to restart its own strategic review. Lagarde has hinted in the past that the ECB would take its cue from the U.S. central bank. 
Danske Bank's chief strategist, Piet Haines Christiansen, expects the ECB to adopt a symmetric inflation target - treating an overshoot with the same vigour as an undershoot - to maintain flexibility.

664,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2020 02:35AM ET</span>",Fed's strategy shift to bind big central banks from Frankfurt to Tokyo,"By Balazs Koranyi and Leika Kihara
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve's landmark shift to a more tolerant stance on inflation will be a drag on the dollar for years and will raise hard questions about the role of central banking, challenging policymakers from Frankfurt to Tokyo. 
On the face of it, the Fed's policy tweak, unveiled on Aug. 27, appears tailored to giving the U.S. economy a shot in the arm. A shift to average inflation targeting lets the Fed overshoot its target after downturns, indicating that rate hikes will come later and the jobs market will be allowed to run hotter, a boon to low-income families. 
But this creates two headaches for global central banks. 
Such a reinterpretation of the Fed's mandate could be seen as a foray into social policy, a vital precedent for others as they reexamine their own roles after years of unconventional moves that already impact wealth and income distribution.
The second, more immediate concern will be the dollar's weakness, which hurts exporters from Europe to Asia. This is bound to feature prominently at the European Central Bank's policy meeting on Thursday, as a strong euro (EUR=) will make it more difficult for exporting nations in the euro zone to climb out of their deepest recession in living memory. 
Countries like Germany and France, or Japan, traditionally generate growth from net exports, which take a hit when their currencies firm. And this firming merely compounds their problem as trade wars between the United States and some of its key trade partners are already weighing on exports.
The dollar <.DXY=> has already weakened by over 10% against a basket of currencies since mid-March to a more than two-year low, prompting ECB chief economist Philip Lane to warn last week that the exchange rate mattered, even if the ECB didn't target it. 
""If there are forces moving the euro/dollar rate around, that feeds into our global and European forecasts and our monetary policy setting,” Lane said. 
Indeed, some economists say that the current exchange rate could already deduct 0.2%-0.4% from euro zone growth and analysts polled by Reuters see more dollar weakness.
Normally this would not be too difficult to counter but the ECB and the Bank of Japan are both close to the limits of ultra easy policy.
Both have cut rates into negative territory and yields are already negative for much of the curve. Both banks also face some domestic opposition to more easing, making further moves politically complicated. 
""If the Fed is going to be late in raising interest rates, that would put upward pressure on the yen against the dollar,"" said Hideo Kumano, a former BOJ official who is currently chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""As long as Fed policy makes it harder for the dollar to rise, the BOJ will have to worry about potential yen rises that needs a policy response including a deepening of negative interest rates,"" he said.
Some economists argue that the ECB should simply shift to a similarly flexible target as part of its own ongoing policy review. But markets price no rate hike at all during Christine Lagarde's eight-year term atop the bank, so a suggestion that policy tightening would be even further pushed out raises credibility issues. 
""Emerging market economies, which are largely dollar funded, will benefit, at least initially,” former ECB board member Benoit Coeure said. ""Europe may need to find new ways to support its economy in the face of permanently lower U.S. rates.""
SOCIAL POLICY?
The Fed's now explicit aim to help low-income families is another complication as it elevates the role of the bank in social policy and could be seen as a sort of reinterpretation of its mandate. 
""Personally, I feel there is room to consider the idea, voiced by some people, that monetary policy should focus more on job and income conditions,"" BOJ Deputy Governor Masazumi Wakatabe said.
The ECB also appears keen to reinterpret its mandate with Lagarde arguing that risks created by climate change are so big, the bank could not ignore them.
But central bankers are unelected bureaucrats and fighting climate change or inequality is a foray into politics, which risks opening their banks to the sort of political attacks that could undermine independence. 
The ECB argues that its mandate already requires it to support the ""general economic policies"" of the European Union, but such an interpretation would still represent a shift given its current focus that is entirely inflation focused. 
Still, some argue that the Fed's shift will prove to be benign.
Lower dollar rates will cut funding costs in emerging markets, accelerating growth and providing a bigger market for exports. And letting U.S. inflation run higher now, will raise both long term rates and inflation expectations, making it easier to normalize policy after years of extraordinary accommodation.

These may prove to be true, but that will not be evident for years to come. And until then, central banks must deal with a weaker dollar.

665,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2020 12:55AM ET</span>",Australia turns to idled factories to pull it out of COVID slump,"By Sam Holmes and Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - In 2017, the last car Australia built rolled out of a General Motors (NYSE:GM)' plant in the city of Adelaide, ending seven decades of local automotive history and the belief that the country's factories could ever compete globally.
Three years later, policymakers are once again looking to manufacturing to generate some growth as they scramble to drive the economy through the coronavirus and out of its deepest slump on record.
While Australians are unlikely to buy millions of locally made cars, refrigerators and toasters as they did in the 20th century, a government push that puts manufacturing at the centre of its longer-term recovery plan has strong industry support and has kindled ventures that would have seemed far-fetched half a year earlier.
Behind the pivot is a realisation that Australia has been too reliant on Asia for the supply of essential goods. A recent worsening in relations with China, Australia's biggest trading partner, has only strengthened that view.
""If you look at it over time, we have been running down our manufacturing and we're at this point of inflexion - we're saying maybe we shouldn't be doing that,"" said Drew Woodhouse, a Sydney-based consultant at Bain & Company who looks at supply chain issues.
For many, the coronavirus has shown that the benefits of globalisation, namely low tariffs and cheap labour, are limited when the world economy grinds to a halt.
That has prompted many in the industry to seriously consider bringing operations onshore, even if it means some costs go up.
What businesses say is needed longer-term are reforms that reduce energy costs, encourage innovation and cut red tape for investment.
Andrew Liveris, former head of U.S. industrial giant Dow Chemicals, returned to his native Australia earlier this year to join Prime Minister Scott Morrison's manufacturing advisory taskforce.
""We have a lot of confusion about how to get investment approved here,"" Liveris told Reuters. ""So we have to adopt a business-friendly environment to attract foreign direct investment to an economy that can punch above its weight in terms of quality research and quality technologies.""
(RE)START YOUR ENGINES
Scarred by critical shortages during World War Two, Australia expanded its factory sector in following years, heavily protected by tariffs.
By the end of the century, however, production had largely drifted offshore as businesses and politicians embraced globalisation's upsides.
In 2019, manufacturing accounted for just 5% of gross domestic product, down from about 25% in 1960, while its share of the labour force has fallen to 7% from 17% in 1984.
Liveris said manufacturing should make up closer to 15% to 20% of GDP.
While some economists see that as an ambitious target, the shift in thinking has galvanised some early movers.
H2X, a startup formed in May, is looking to resurrect local automobile production by making hydrogen cars in Port Kembla, a smelting town about 100km south of Sydney.
Brendan Norman, the company's chief executive who previously worked on hydrogen cars in China, expects a prototype to be ready later this year and production to start in 2022. The operation is looking to employ 100 people by the end of this year, which could ramp up to 5,000 by 2025.
Norman said production could use 80% local content by 2024. That bet is based on a belief that Australia already has most of the skills and materials needed to make items such as supercapacitors and fuel cells, even if the manufacturing scale is not there yet.
""Australia can certainly compete in this because it is high-tech manufacturing and this is something that we feel we should be able to encourage to come back,"" he said.
""If we're producing the bulk of the world's hydrogen, I'd like to think that we can produce the tools that are required to use it properly.""
SCOPE FOR REFORM
H2X's plan relies less on low labour costs that offshore production provides and more on the value of intellectual property, like Germany's high-tech factory sector. 
Visy Industries, a recycling and packaging company, expanded into glass manufacturing in a deal worth almost A$1 billion ($730.80 million).
That move comes as China's recent curbs on waste imports forces Australia to come up with innovative ways of dealing with its garbage.
One of the central proposals of the manufacturing taskforce is to lower energy costs by boosting distribution.
Australian businesses are paying about 50% more for natural gas than its export customers, the country's competition watchdog said.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said last week that policies that foster entrepreneurship and cut red tape will be key in next month's national budget. 
Tony Shepherd, former chairman of infrastructure firm Transfield Services, said Australia needed to use the crisis to better streamline investment policies across the multiple layers of government.
""We couldn't even produce the basic medical supplies and we were worried about toilet paper,"" he said, referring to the panic buying of toilet tissue earlier this year. ""If that isn't enough of a wake up call for politicians to get going, I don't know what is.""

666,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2020 11:20PM ET</span>",Australian banks start asking for loan repayments after six-month virus grace period,"By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's banks said on Monday they have started asking customers to pay back loans after giving them a six month hiatus due to the coronavirus, prompting concerns some borrowers will be forced to sell their homes once government support ends.
The Australian Banking Association (ABA), a lobby group, said its members had started contacting holders of 260,000 mortgages and 105,000 business loans to check if they could resume payments once deferrals expired in September and October.
Australian lenders have deferred A$274 billion ($200 billion) worth of loans, according to a financial regulator, as the economy has fallen into technical recession and the jobless rate has hit its highest levels since the 1990s.
""Those who can resume repayments at the end of their deferral will be required to do so,"" said the ABA in a statement.
Struggling customers may be offered a change to interest-only repayments or a loan extension, while those unable to pay long-term would be offered ""tailored assistance"", the association added.
The country's banking sector is treading a sensitive path as it faces pressure to revert to profit growth while winning back community support after a 2018 public inquiry battered its public standing.
When Australia closed its borders and shut much of its economy in March to slow the virus, banks rushed to offer so-called loan holidays for six months to affected customers. Repayment was paused by another four months on some of those loans, to struggling borrowers.
But the ABA said the grace period had expired for some 450,000 borrowers. Meanwhile, government emergency stimulus payments are set to be pared back from this month.
""We've got to have an overarching goal here from the banks that people aren't forced to foreclose or be chased by debt collectors because of hardship associated with COVID-19,"" said Gerard Brody, CEO of the Consumer Action Law Centre.
Peter Strong, CEO of the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia, urged banks to treat business borrowers on a case by case basis given the country's second most populous state, Victoria, extended a full lockdown over the weekend.

667,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2020 07:35PM ET</span>",UK's Johnson planning to override parts of Brexit withdrawal agreement - FT,"(Reuters) - The British government is planning legislation that will override key parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, risking the collapse of trade negotiations with Brussels, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
Sections of the internal market bill, due to be published on Wednesday, are expected to ""eliminate the legal force of parts of the withdrawal agreement"" in areas including state aid and Northern Ireland customs, the newspaper said, citing three people familiar with the plans.
A source told the FT that the move could ""clearly and consciously"" undermine the agreement on Northern Ireland that Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed last October to avoid a return to a hard border in the region.
The move comes as Britain and the European Union resume talks on a trade deal, with Johnson saying on Sunday that if an agreement is not reached by Oct. 15, both sides should ""accept that and move on"".
If the sticking point of fisheries and state aid cannot be resolved and a deal agreed, Britain would have a trading relationship with the bloc like Australia's, which would be ""a good outcome"", Johnson said.
The planned legislation, as reported by the Financial Times, would ratchet up tension between the two sides by attempting to undo some of the elements of the Withdrawal Agreement signed earlier this year, including those relating to the border between EU-member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.
The move was condemned by parties on both sides of the Irish border.
Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, who played a key role in negotiating the withdrawal agreement and Northern Ireland protocol, said on Twitter that the reported move ""would be a very unwise way to proceed.""
Senior members of Northern Ireland's Sinn Fein and SDLP parties, the region's two largest Irish nationalist groups, also criticised the British government's plan, as reported by the newspaper.

Britain left the EU on Jan. 31 but there has been little progress on a new trade deal after a status-quo transition arrangement ends in December.
Talks, which have stalled over Britain's insistence that it has full autonomy over state aid and fishing, are due to resume in London on Tuesday. 
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian said an agreement on trade needed to be reached urgently and he blamed the stalemate on Britain's attitude.
Johnson will say there is no sense in thinking about timelines beyond Oct. 15.
""If we can't agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on,"" he will say, according to comments released by his office.
If no deal is agreed, Britain would have a trading relationship with the bloc like Australia's, which would be ""a good outcome"", Johnson will say.
""As a government we are preparing, at our borders and at our ports, to be ready for it,"" he will say. ""We will have full control over our laws, our rules, and our fishing waters.""
In that case, Britain would be ready to find sensible accommodation with the bloc on practical issues such as flights, lorry transport or scientific cooperation, according to the excerpts.
UK Brexit negotiator David Frost said on Sunday Britain was not scared of a no-deal exit at the end of the year.
Johnson will say there is still a deal to be had based on a standard free trade agreement if the EU is ready to rethink its current position.
""But we cannot and will not compromise on the fundamentals of what it means to be an independent country to get it,"" he will say.

Investing.com - Stocks on Wall Street closed lower for the second straight session on Friday as another steep decline in Big Tech shares dragged down the market.
 


 
The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3% to 11,313.13. The tech-heavy index was down by as much as 4.6% at its lows of the day. Friday’s downbeat performance came one day after the Nasdaq suffered its worst one-day drop since March.
 


 
The S&P 500 declined 0.8% to 3,426.96, after being down as much as 3.1% earlier in the session.
 


 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average meanwhile closed 159 points lower, or 0.6%, at 28,133.31. At one point, the 30-stock index fell as much as 628 points, or 2.2%.
 


 
For the week, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both snapped their respective five-week winning streaks, falling 3.3% and 2.3%, while the Dow lost 1.8%.
 


 
Shares of major tech companies retreated sharply this week, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) leading losses. Apple is now 12% away from its all-time high reached earlier in the week, while Tesla is almost 17% below its record peak.
 
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), known as the ‘FATMAN’ group of stocks, are also trading well below their recent highs, sparking fears over the tech bubble.

671,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>",California grid operator warns of rotating power outages in record heat wave,"(Reuters) - The California Independent System Operator (ISO) declared a ""Stage 2"" power emergency late on Saturday, warning that rotating power outages were possible amid a record heat wave.
A Stage 2 power emergency means the ISO has taken all mitigating actions but can no longer provide its expected energy requirements.
Temperatures of up to 125 degrees Fahrenheit (49 Celsius) were set to punish California through the Labor Day weekend, raising the risk of wildfires and rolling blackouts.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Friday declared a state of emergency, a proclamation that allows power plants to operate beyond normal limits through the three-day holiday weekend.
The National Weather Service (NWS) forecast a heat wave carrying ""rare, dangerous and very possibly fatal"" temperatures across Southern California for the holiday weekend.
State officials urged Californians to turn off unnecessary appliances and lights to help avoid blackouts from an overwhelmed power grid.
Authorities also asked power generators to delay any maintenance until after the weekend to prevent blackouts like the two nights of rolling outages in mid-August as residents cranked up their air conditioning.
This weekend was expected to be hotter than the one in mid-August that helped trigger the second- and third-largest forest fires in California history. Those fires are still burning.
Death Valley in California's Mojave desert registered one of the hottest air temperatures recorded on the planet of 130F (54C) on Aug. 17, and highs of around 124 were expected there on Sunday, the NWS said.
San Francisco-based power provider PG&E Corp said on Saturday that it may be asked by the grid operator to turn off power due to the ""extreme heat."" It urged customers to conserve power. 
The company said it may have to cut power early on Monday and Tuesday in parts of Northern California as hot, dry winds are expected to threaten the region.
PG&E said its potential power shut-offs may impact parts of 17 counties, which would include about 103,000 customers.

672,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 06, 2020 06:39AM ET</span>",Economic Calendar - Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,"By Noreen Burke
Investing.com -- This week's report on U.S. consumer inflation figures will be closely watched after the Federal Reserve’s recent policy shift to adopt average inflation targeting. The shakeout in stock markets looks set to continue as traders return after the U.S. Labor Day holiday. The European Central Bank will hold its latest policy meeting on Thursday against a background of slowing inflation and a strengthening euro. Brexit talks between the European Union and UK will resume on Tuesday with hopes for a trade deal before the end-2020 deadline diminishing fast. Meanwhile, China's August trade data will give more insight in to the speed of the recovery from the pandemic in the world’s number-two economy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
U.S. inflation seems to have little chance of hitting 2% anytime soon and Friday's inflation figures for August are expected to show core CPI rising 0.2% month-on-month and 1.6% on a year-over-year basis.
The Fed, which is now aiming for an average has said it won't worry about inflation running above its 2% target, which is seen as giving it room to keep interest rates low for as long as it wants.
That's good news for stock markets, property and other sectors that benefit from cheap money.
Market participants will also be watching Thursday’s report on initial jobless claims for fresh insights into the strength of the recovery in the labor market after the August jobs report showed that hiring slowed again last month as financial aid from the government dried up.
Last week’s stock market shakeout looks set to continue as traders return to their desks after the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Monday amid persistent concerns about high valuations and an uneven economic recovery.
Following a steep selloff on Thursday that carried over into Friday, the three major indexes regained some ground late Friday to close well off the lows of the day, though trading remained volatile.
Thursday’s sell-off already reflected investor fears that valuations for mega-cap tech stocks had overheated and these worries were exacerbated on Friday when the Financial Times reported that options trading by Japan’s Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) had inflated these stocks.
The selloff could be a preview for a rocky two months to come as institutional investors return from summer vacations and focus their attention the potential economic pitfalls in the year ahead.
ECB officials will have plenty to discuss at their policy meeting on Thursday after the euro hit $1.20 for the first time since 2018 and euro zone inflation turned negative in August for the first time since 2016. The slide into deflation is a red flag for the central bank, which targets annual inflation of close to, but just below 2%.
Yet it may be premature for the ECB to announce any major new steps on Thursday.
The euro has been boosted by a broadly weaker dollar and improved sentiment towards the European Union’s 750 billion-euro pandemic rescue fund. As such, any impact on inflation may be temporary.
But in the longer term, the ECB may be forced to reevaluate its monetary policy given the Fed’s shift to tolerate higher inflation, which could weigh on the dollar for years to come.
Brexit talks between UK and EU negotiators are due to resume in London on Tuesday, but an imminent breakthrough seems unlikely.
Talks have stalled over Britain’s demands on fishing quotas and its desire to use state aid to build up its tech sector.
Britain left the EU on Jan. 31 but talks have so far made little headway on agreeing a new trade deal for when the transition agreement ends on Dec. 31. There is less than a month to go before the Oct. 2 deadline for a deal which would then have to be ratified at an EU summit.
Separately, data on Friday is expected to show that the UK economy rebounded again July, given that many lockdown measures were eased during the month.
Trade figures out of China on Monday are expected to show exports rose solidly for a second straight month in August, while imports edged back into growth.
Chinese exports have not been as severely affected by the global slowdown as some analysts had feared and are set to be a key driver in the nation’s economic recovery.
Already high tensions between Washington and Beijing are expected to escalate ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. China remains well behind on its pledge to boost purchases of U.S. goods under the Phase 1 trade deal that took effect in February.

Officials in the government are also working on options to reform the program, the website reported, adding that the extension of the program was meant to be an interim measure.
No-one was immediately available to verify the report.
The Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Program offered loans to landlords of entrepreneurs worth half the tenant's rent from April through August, if tenants pay a quarter and the landlord absorbs the remaining quarter.
However, the program requires landlords to apply, which has prompted low uptake and left many tenants powerless to get relief as their landlords refuse to make applications. 
Canada had also rolled out the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) to offer broad support to the millions of Canadians who lost their jobs amid coronavirus shutdowns.
The government put the CERB program in place because the traditional employment insurance (EI) system could not handle the rapid influx of new applicants as millions of people were laid off, or lost work hours, due to COVID-19. 

Many people also did not qualify for traditional EI.

676,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>",Japan's Suga signals ultra-easy monetary policy to continue,"By Leika Kihara and Yuka Obayashi
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, a frontrunner to be the next prime minister, said he would like the central bank to continue its ultra-loose monetary policy as the economy is still struggling with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
In an interview that ran on Saturday in the Nikkei newspaper, Suga also said he would consider compiling another economic stimulus package by the end of this year to ""put the pandemic to an end and shift the economy to a new stage."" 
""I highly approve of his handling of monetary policy,"" Suga said of BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, who undertook bold easing steps that were part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ""Abenomics"" stimulus strategy. 
""I want to carry over (the bold easing steps),"" he was quoted as saying by the paper. 
The remarks reinforce expectations that Suga will continue with many of Abe's pro-growth economic policies as the pandemic adds to the pain of an economy already in deep recession.
Suga told Nikkei he would take steps to revitalise smaller firms by promoting consolidation and boosting competitiveness. 
He also expressed hope of creating a new government agency to promote digitalisation of government services and various industries such as healthcare, as delays on this front have slowed payouts to companies and households hit by COVID-19.
""I know there could be resistance, but we should move forward on this,"" Suga said of his plan to allow clinics to permanently offer medical treatment online.
Japan currently allows online treatment only as a temporary step to accommodate patients having difficulty visiting hospitals due to COVID-19. 
Suga is widely expected to win the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) leadership election on Sept. 14, set after Abe's decision to step down. The winner is virtually assured of becoming premier due to the LDP's parliamentary majority.
Markets have been rife with speculation that Suga, upon becoming prime minister, may call a snap election in coming months to solidify his political grip.

""What people want most from the government is to deal with the pandemic and create a safe environment to live,"" Suga told a television programme, when asked whether he would call an early snap election if he becomes Japan's new leader.

678,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 10:57PM ET</span>",Fast take: The jobs report and the U.S. presidential race,"By Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - An unexpectedly steep drop in the U.S. unemployment rate last month looks to offer fresh ammunition for President Donald Trump as he stumps for votes contending he is the better choice for the U.S. economy in the run-up to the Nov. 3 presidential election. 
But the Labor Department's monthly jobs report also contains tinder for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to make his own case against Trump's economic stewardship, with fewer job gains and widening disparity among racial groups. 
Trump was quick off the draw with his take: ""Great Jobs Numbers!"" he tweeted, adding that the unemployment rate had fallen below 10%, the peak during the Great Recession, sinking ""faster and deeper than thought possible.""
Biden, meanwhile, took Trump's economic stewardship to task in a campaign speech on Friday. ""The economic pain remains unrelenting for millions of working people from every race and background who aren't getting the relief they need.""
Historically, incumbent presidential candidates are hurt by a weak economy, and the coronavirus pandemic touched off the worst quarter in modern U.S. economic history. But a sharp recovery could offset that.
With just one more national employment scorecard due before Election Day, here's a look at some highlights of Friday's report and what they may mean for each political candidate: 
FALLING UNEMPLOYMENT RATE LOOKS GOOD FOR TRUMP:
At 8.4%, the unemployment rate is lower than many top economists had expected it to be even by the end of the year. 
The drop surprised economists, who forecast a slide to 9.8% from July's 10.2%. While still well above the pre-crisis rate of 3.5%, the steep downward trajectory plays into Trump's narrative of a quick return to a strong economy as businesses re-open.

https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ECONOMY-JOBS/jznpnxmjrpl/chart.png
SLOWING JOB GAINS NOT SO GOOD FOR TRUMP
Including the 1.37 million jobs gained in August, U.S. employment has recouped just about half its losses since the crisis began, still leaving the total number of employed short by 11.5 million compared with six months earlier. Moreover, the pace of gains has slowed, particularly in the hard-hit leisure and hospitality sector. 
Just 174,000 leisure and hospitality jobs were created in August, less than 10% of new jobs in the sector created in June.
""If this sector has run out of steam, high levels of joblessness will last longer than initially thought,"" wrote Nick Bunker, chief economist at job search website Indeed.
In fact, private-sector hiring overall at just over 1 million fell well short of the median estimate among economists in a Reuters poll, and the big overall driver was government hiring - mostly for 238,000 short-term jobs for the 2020 U.S. Census.

WIDENING RACIAL GAP COULD BOLSTER BIDEN'S CASE
The strengthening job market benefited white people more than Black people, marking the fourth month of reversal of a pre-crisis trend that had brought Black and white unemployment rates much closer to parity than ever before.
Among Black people the jobless rate dropped to 13% in August, from 14.6% in July; for white people it fell to 7.3% from 9.2% a month earlier. The gap was the biggest in six years, underscoring racial inequalities that have become a flashpoint in the presidential election campaign.
For a graphic on Black vs white unemployment:

WOMEN'S GAINS STALL, DINGING TRUMP
The share of the U.S. population who had a job or were seeking a job - a yardstick of labor market vibrancy - rose in August, but gains were driven almost entirely by men. 
The male labor force participation rate climbed to 67.7% from 67.1%, while the rate for women barely changed, inching up to 56.1% from 56% a month earlier. 
For those in their peak working years, ages 25 to 54, the gender split was even more pronounced, with the participation rate for women declining for a second straight month, while it edged up for men, pushing the gap between them to 13.2 percentage points, the widest in more than a year.
With both political candidates courting the female vote, a stall out in women's labor force gains in August bodes poorly for Trump.

679,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 10:57PM ET</span>",Column: Trump tax deferral poses a bigger threat to Social Security than you might think,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - What happens to Social Security if we eliminate its funding? 
That is the question to ask after Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-congress/trump-vows-to-suspend-us-payroll-tax-after-coronavirus-aid-talks-with-congress-break-down-idUSKCN2532DZ last weekend ordering the deferral through year-end of revenue collected under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act - better known as the payroll tax - that funds Social Security.
FICA is the more appropriate name, because it more accurately describes the purpose of these payroll deductions. ""I think of it as an insurance premium that we pay for Social Security,"" said Bill Arnone, chief executive officer of the National Academy of Social Insurance, a network of research and policy experts on the nation’s social insurance programs. 
Arnone worries about the short-term impact of a payroll tax deferral on the finances of Social Security - and even more about the long-term danger if Trump gets a chance to follow through on a threat he made last weekend - echoed by a top campaign lieutenant - to push for termination altogether of the Social Security tax if he wins a second term.
""The idea that we would not fund Social Security this way in the future opens the door to a fundamentally different approach that changes the program from social insurance to something else,"" Arnone said. ""It would become more like a safety net, and not social insurance.""
Trump stated in the memo that deferring worker FICA obligations is a ""modest, targeted action [that] will put money directly in the pockets of American workers and generate additional incentives for work and employment, right when the money is needed most.""
Social Security and Medicare provide benefits we all earn through a lifetime of contributions - or premiums - that we pay via the FICA. Earned benefit is a core concept of social insurance, alongside the idea that these programs efficiently protect us all against risks - the loss of income in old age in the case of Social Security, or healthcare costs in the case of Medicare.
Social Security is funded primarily by a 12.4% FICA tax split evenly by workers and employers - the program also earns some revenue from interest on trust fund bonds and taxation of benefits. The employer share of the tax was deferred until year end under CARES Act relief legislation signed into law in March. The new presidential memorandum https:// would suspend the employee share from September through December for workers earning less than $4,000 biweekly, pretax.
A FICA deferral will be ineffective as economic policy - it provides tax relief to employed people, not those who have lost jobs and need disaster relief - assistance keeping a roof overhead and food on the table. It is also unclear that employers will want to execute this short-term deferral of tax payments that will be due in 2021 anyway.
A re-elected Trump might have trouble getting a termination of FICA through Congress, and administration officials making the rounds of Sunday morning news shows last weekend tried to walk back that pledge. But here is the scenario that frightens progressive Social Security advocates: if re-elected, Trump could continue to defer contributions under the emergency powers he is leveraging now as the pandemic crisis rolls on.
LEVERAGE FOR REFORM
That could fundamentally alter the balance of power on reform of Social Security in favor of proposals long favored by Republicans, argues Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, a leading progressive advocacy group.
""What Trump has shown is that he believes he has the authority and to decide when FICA contributions are due,"" she said. ""One option for him, if he is re-elected, is to say that the pandemic has us in such bad economic straits that he will defer FICA collections until 2024. That would drain the Social Security trust fund to zero in about two years - at which point he has all the leverage.""
Leverage for what? The Republican Social Security agenda has been spelled out in legislative proposals and bipartisan reform commissions convened over the years. 
The combined Social Security retirement and disability trust funds face a long-term financial shortfall, with program trustees projecting ""exhaustion"" of the funds in 2035. That would leave sufficient FICA revenue to pay roughly 80% of promised benefits. (https://reut.rs/3fRNgXg)
Democrats advocate closing the gap by raising the cap on wages subject to FICA taxes ($137,700 this year) and gradually raising tax rates for employers and workers.
On the Republican side, the big idea is raising the full retirement age (FRA), when you can claim 100% of your earned benefit. The FRA already is rising gradually to 67 under reforms enacted in 1983; Republicans have proposed raising it further to 69 or 70. They also favor means-testing benefits, which would shade the program toward a welfare structure - a benefit you need, rather than one you earn. Under President George W. Bush, they proposed changing Social Security into a system of voluntary personal investment accounts. 
Do Altman’s fears sound far-fetched? Well, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican chair of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, said this week https:// he would support permanent elimination of the FICA tax if it were tied to broader reforms of the program.
Even if that does not come to pass, interrupting the flow of FICA revenue will increase public worry, already sky-high, about the future of Social Security. Most polls show people worry a great deal about whether their benefits will be there in the future. For example, the Pew Research Center has found https://pewrsr.ch/2XQBCpk that 42% of non-retirees doubt they will receive any Social Security benefits when they leave the workforce, and another 42% think benefits will be provided, but at a reduced level.
Defunding Social Security is a surprising proposal to hear in an election year - but that does not mean we should not pay attention.

681,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 10:56PM ET</span>",No cause yet for ECB alarm over euro strength,"By Olga Cotaga
LONDON (Reuters) - How concerned should policymakers be by the euro's rapid rise to 28-month highs? Those tracking the currency's effects on growth, inflation and exports reckon it's still some way off levels that would start to dent economic recovery.
Since mid-May, the currency (EUR=EBS) has risen nearly 10%versus the dollar and futures markets show it has drawn a record number of bullish bets. 
On a trade-weighted basis , the gauge watched by the European Central Bank, the euro is up nearly 5%.
That pace of gains was last seen in mid-2017, a time of optimism about economic growth - in marked contrast to the current appreciation that coincides with the deflationary and recessionary impact of a pandemic.
Graphic: Euro during the coronavirus crisis - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegpbobwbvq/Pasted%20image%201599140904172.png 
As inflation turned negative in August for the first time since 2016, some economists placed the blame on the euro and piled on the pressure for the ECB to act
ECB chief economist Philip Lane delivered the first salvo, saying the exchange rate ""does matter"" for monetary policy, while the Financial Times quoted unnamed ECB sources as saying euro strength was concerning.
Yet it may be premature for the ECB to announce any steps at its Sept. 10 meeting. 
Euro strength stems not solely from U.S. assets' vanishing interest rate advantage over Europe, but from improved sentiment towards Europe's proactive response to COVID-19 that included a 750 billion-euro (670 billion pounds) fund seeded by joint debt sales. 
ECB board member Isabel Schnabel told Reuters she was ""not worrying too much about exchange rate developments,"" as a weak dollar usually lifts global trade and growth, offsetting the euro effect for local firms.
Nomura analyst Jordan Rochester agreed and said the euro was up for ""good reasons"".
""A strong currency due to positive macro fundamentals is not that much of a bad thing for policymakers and its inflation impact is temporary in nature,"" he said. 
A cut to Germany's value-added tax may have hit August prices, which was predicted by the ECB, according to minutes of its July meeting, he added. 
Graphic: ECB to rein in euro? - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgvonlnwpd/Pasted%20image%201599212950972.png
LEVEL TO WATCH IS 10% YEAR-ON-YEAR
The ECB still has no room for complacency. 
In common with other central banks, it may be forced to rethink longer-term monetary policy given the U.S. Federal Reserve's landmark shift to a more tolerant inflation stance, which could weaken the dollar for years.
But as of now, the euro's rise should not inflict major damage. At current levels, the trade-weighted euro would take 0.1-0.2 percentage point off ECB inflation projections in the coming year, ABN Amro strategist Nick Kounis estimated.
This is bad news in a deflationary environment, but ""not the end of the world,"" Kounis said.
Another 3%-4% rise in the trade-weighted rate was, he said, ""where (the ECB) would be thinking not only about what strategy to use to boost inflation but also specific measures to target the euro.""
For many, the level to watch is a year-on-year 10% appreciation. From current levels that would take the euro near $1.30. A 10% gain is also the level analysts say would knock 0.4% off the euro zone's annual economic growth and around 6% of earnings-per-share at regional firms.
Dhaval Joshi, investment strategist at BCA Research cited past ECB claims that a 10% euro rise shaves 0.4-0.5 percentage point from inflation.
""I think the ECB are watching the rate of appreciation of the euro with perhaps 10% year-on-year as a point of concern...another 2.5% appreciation would be a trigger point to act in my view,"" Joshi said. 
A further consideration is that, even after its rally, the euro is not expensive and sits in the middle of its two-decade trading range of $0.80-$1.60.

Adjusted for inflation differentials against its peers such as dollar, sterling and yen, the euro is 5% below its long-term average, Nomura's Rochester says. Graphic: euro positions - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgvdogjnpo/euro%20positions.JPG

682,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 10:56PM ET</span>","Payment holiday parachute might COVID-proof government bonds, top fund says","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The option of a one-time payment holiday during times of intense crisis might enable countries to pandemic-proof their bonds, a prominent debt fund believes.
Economic fallout from COVID-19 has triggered a record number of sovereign defaults in 2020, and managers at Boston-based GMO, heavily involved in sovereign restructurings in recent years, have proposed redesigning bonds so that countries can suspend or even wipe off debt payments for up to a year. 
Credit rating agency S&P has downgraded 51 countries this year, and four - Lebanon, Ecuador, Argentina and Belize - have already defaulted, beating a record set in 2017.
""In the case of Ecuador, it might have provided enough liquidity relief to prevent a default,"" said GMO's Carl Ross, one of the payment holiday plan's two architects and a negotiator in Ecuador's and Argentina's restructurings.
He favours that idea over current approaches such the linking of debt payments to economic fortunes chosen in 2012 by Greece, and the ""hurricane clause"" - offering debt relief if a second catastrophic storm hits - used in Grenada's 2015 restructuring.
""Our proposal is to revert to something much simpler,"" Ross said. ""The whole idea is to prevent countries getting into distress in the first place"".
Sui-Jim Ho, a partner at Cleary Gottlieb - the law firm that helped draft Granada's hurricane clause - said discussion around temporary debt suspensions was gaining traction.
However, he questioned how simple implementing them would be.
""We still need to figure out how the pandemic trigger event should be drafted,"" he said ""...Defined too loosely and it could be triggered too easily. Defined too restrictively and you could end up with too little too late.""
Graphic: Bond prices plunge ahead of defaults https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvllxenvb/Pasted%20image%201598352935580.png
GAME THEORY
Ross said the potential criticism that GMO's proposal could be abused by politicians looking for creative funding options was a low risk.
Bond markets would soon work out governments that tried to play the system, and as the deferral option would only be available once - or perhaps once a decade for long-term bonds - it was also likely to be used sparingly.
""Interactions between bond markets and governments are a 'repeated game' ... We believe this dynamic would be a very effective self-policing mechanism,"" he said.
His idea would need International Monetary Fund or U.S. Treasury support to take off, and a country would also have prove it was workable.
Ross said he suggested it to Ecuador but the process was moving too fast by then, and it wouldn't have prevented Argentina or Lebanon defaulting as their debts had already spiralled out of control. 
Countries hit by multiple crises wouldn't be saved either as having more than one deferral or debt forgiveness option would ramp up their borrowing costs.
Ross and the proposal's co-author, Mustafa Ulukan, estimate that a single one-year deferral option might only add 0.6% to the 8% a country with a low B-grade rating might pay to borrow for 10 years.
The approach could also address 'freeriding' criticism private sector bondholders are now facing for not following G20 governments and allowing the world's poorest countries to suspend debt payments during COVID-19.
Pressure for that to happen is growing but creditors warn the rating agencies would class it as a default, opening up a host of problems. That is something GMO thinks its plan would avoid.
""This (deferral) option, if broadly used, would be extraordinarily valuable in the current global environment,"" Ross said. ""This year and 2021, we have a lot of countries that are going to default.""

683,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 10:55PM ET</span>",Fed's Powell: rates to stay low for 'however long it takes',"(Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday said the U.S. jobs report for August was ""a good one,"" but noted that with gains likely to slow, the central bank is planning to keep its foot on the monetary policy gas pedal for years.
""We do think it will get harder from here — because of those areas of the economy that are so directly affected by the pandemic still,"" Powell told National Public Radio in an interview, referring particularly to sectors like leisure, hospitality, travel and entertainment that depend on large gatherings made unsafe by the virus.
Even as U.S. employers added 1.37 million jobs last month, the total number of jobs regained since the crisis has only been about half the total lost, leaving millions still out of work.
""We think that the economy's going to need low interest rates, which support economic activity, for an extended period of time ... it will be measured in years,"" Powell said. ""However long it takes, we're going to be there.""
The unemployment rate in August fell to 8.4% from 10.2% in July, and is lower now than most Fed officials had expected it would be by the end of the year. 
Fed policymakers release fresh forecasts at their next policy meeting, slated for mid-September. Powell's remarks are the last public comments from any U.S. central banker until then. 
The Fed slashed rates to near zero in March and has rolled out a raft of lending programs to support businesses and households. It is also buying tens of billions of bonds monthly to keep markets functioning smoothly. 
Under a new framework adopted last week, the Fed signaled it would not raise interest rates just because the labor market is improving, and pledged to aim for inflation to rise moderately above 2% to make up for periods of too-low rates, like the current one.
""We're not going to prematurely withdraw the support that we think the economy needs,"" Powell told NPR. ""We ought to do everything we can as a country to keep those people, I won't say make them whole but I would say, to look out for them.""
Negotiations over new pandemic relief spending have been stalled for weeks in Congress as Democrats push for a bigger package and Republicans aim for a targeted bill. 
Indeed, after Friday's jobs report White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the recovery is on a ""self-sustaining"" path. 
To Powell, though, the recovery continues to need help from both the Fed and Congress. 
""The time to start working on fiscal sustainability is not right now when we have so many people in need,"" Powell said. 
Regular people can also do their part, Powell suggested.

""There's actually enormous economic gains to be had nationwide from people wearing masks and keeping their distance,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain named former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott as a trade adviser on Friday, rejecting criticism that his conservative views on gender, same sex marriage and climate change made him unfit to represent the United Kingdom.
Some British lawmakers, including the leader of the opposition Keir Starmer, Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon and a member of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's own party, Caroline Nokes, have said Abbott was not suitable for the job.
The 62-year-old, who led Australia from 2013-2015, supported Britain's exit from the European Union. He joins Daniel Hannan, another Brexit supporter and former member of the European Parliament, in becoming advisers to Britain's Board of Trade. 
""The new Board of Trade will play an important role in helping Britain make the case for free and fair trade across the UK and around the world,"" Secretary of State for International Trade, Liz Truss, said in a statement.
Board members and advisers meet quarterly to make a case for free trade and engage with industry.
Abbott has attracted criticism from British opposition politicians and media outlets over his views on homosexuality, gender, climate change and COVID following reports he had been linked with the job. He has rejected accusations of misogyny.
The opposition Labour Party said Abbott was not experienced in detailed trade negotiations, had a history of offensive statements and questioned why he had been given the role.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has repeatedly refused to bow to what he sees as fleeting media storms, defended Abbott before the appointment was announced on Friday.
""This is a guy who was elected by the people of the great liberal democratic nation of Australia,"" he said.

Anne Boden, another adviser and head of Starling Bank, said she was pleased to have been selected and added that she supported diversity just like Julia Gillard. Gillard, Australia's only female prime minister, attacked Abbott for misogyny in a parliamentary showdown that went viral on social media.

685,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 01:36PM ET</span>",A College Degree Is the Ticket to Still Working From Home,"(Bloomberg) -- A college degree can make a big difference.
About 13 million more Americans were back at workplaces in August than in May as fewer education, manufacturing and transportation employees said they were working from home because of the pandemic. That leaves an even wider gap between those who can shelter from the coronavirus and those who are required to be physically present at work as lockdowns are lifted, according to data released Friday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Among the quarter of American employees still working at home because of the pandemic, a majority were in jobs such as computer science, legal and finance, the data showed. Asian workers were the most likely group to be telecommuting while Hispanic workers were the least likely.
“It’s clear in the data that higher-skilled, higher paid occupations are still working from home in large numbers,” said Adam Ozimek, chief economist at  Upwork  (NASDAQ:UPWK), a jobs listing website. “Some of the management occupations are 50% or higher and you get down to the service occupations and you’re talking single digits.” He said he considers the large number of people staying out of offices to be a positive because it reduces crowding and potential virus exposure. The disease has sickened more than 6 million people in the U.S. and killed about 187,000.
The Covid-19 outbreak has highlighted inequities in the workforce, allowing higher-paid, more educated people — often White or Asian — to isolate more easily than those who hold lower-paying jobs in industries such as retail and manufacturing that require close contact with others. Data has consistently shown Black Americans are twice as likely to die from the virus as White Americans.
Education also figures into where people can do their jobs, which also explains some of the disparities. For workers with a high school degree or less, about 12% were working from home in August. For those with at least some college, 44% were telecommuting, while more than half of employees with advanced degrees were remote, the BLS data showed. Asian and White workers are more likely to have a college education than Black or Hispanic workers, according to the BLS.

“Donald Trump may be the only president in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he took office,” Biden said in a speech in Wilmington, Delaware.
“The report reinforced the worst fears and painful truths,” Biden said, noting that the wealthy are enjoying a recovery while others are not.
Friday’s job report beat estimates as the unemployment rate dropped to 8.4%, almost 2 percentage points lower than expected. But the U.S. still leads the world in coronavirus cases and deaths, as more than 185,000 Americans have died from the virus.
Trump celebrated the report on Twitter on Friday morning.
“Wow, much better than expected!” Trump wrote. “Broke the 10% level faster and deeper than thought possible.”
Trump had planned to run for re-election on a strong economy that was devastated by the coronavirus pandemic. But the report will likely bolster Trump’s argument that he is best positioned to lead an economic recovery. The president has often polled better than Biden on economic issues.
Still, the report had warning signs as the pandemic persists and congressional leaders spar over future economic relief packages. The number of permanent job losses rose by more than half a million and gains in the leisure and hospitality industries that spurred job growth in the past few months cooled significantly.

688,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 11:51AM ET</span>",U.S. labor market slowing as fiscal stimulus boost ebbs,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed further in August as financial assistance from the government ran out, threatening the economy's recovery from the COVID-19 recession.
Government hiring for the 2020 Census accounted for nearly a fifth of the employment gains reported by the Labor Department on Friday. Companies from transportation to manufacturing industries are announcing layoffs or furloughs. The moderation in hiring could pressure the White House and Congress to restart stalled negotiations for another fiscal package, and will likely become political ammunition for both Democrats and Republicans with just two months to go until the presidential election.
Programs to help businesses pay wages have either lapsed or are on the verge of ending. A $600 weekly unemployment supplement expired in July. Economists credited government largesse for the sharp rebound in economic activity after it nearly ground to a halt following the shuttering of businesses in mid-March to control the spread of the coronavirus.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 1.371 million jobs last month after advancing 1.734 million in July. Government employment rose 344,000, with 238,000 temporary workers hired for the population count. Job growth peaked at 4.781 million in June. 
The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month from 10.2% in July, even as more people entered the labor force. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 1.4 million jobs added in August and the unemployment rate sliding to 9.8%.
Friday's report is one of just two monthly labor market scorecards left on the calendar before the Nov. 3 presidential election. President Donald Trump, who is trailing in polls behind former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic Party nominee, is likely to tout the continued job gains as a sign that the economy is improving after suffering its biggest shock in at least 73 years in the second quarter. 
But employment remains 11.5 million below its pre-pandemic level and the jobless rate is 4.9 percentage points higher than it was in February. 
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
LAYOFFS AND FURLOUGHS RISING
Most of the job gains have been workers being recalled from furloughs or temporary layoffs. Though new COVID-19 infections have subsided after a broad resurgence through the summer, many hot spots remain.
United Airlines (O:UAL) said on Wednesday it was preparing to furlough 16,370 workers on Oct. 1. American Airlines (O:AAL) has announced its workforce would shrink by 40,000, including 19,000 involuntary cuts.  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said it was targeting 1,400 U.S. salaried jobs for elimination by year end. Mass transit rail operators are also eyeing furloughs.
A report this week from the Federal Reserve based on information collected from the U.S. central bank's contacts on or before Aug. 24 showed an increase in employment. The Fed, however, noted that ""some districts also reported slowing job growth and increased hiring volatility, particularly in service industries, with rising instances of furloughed workers being laid off permanently as demand remained soft.""
Slowing job growth will likely have a limited impact on gross domestic product in the third quarter, which economists estimate could rebound at an annualized rate of as high as 30% after sinking at a historic 31.7% pace in the April-June quarter. But it will hurt fourth-quarter GDP, with consumer spending taking a hit.
Average hourly earnings increased 0.4% in August after edging up 0.1% in July. That left the annual increase in wage at 4.7%. The average workweek increased by 0.1 hour to 34.6 hours. The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, however, cautioned against reading too much into the longer workweek and higher earnings. Job losses during the pandemic have been concentrated in the low-wage services industries. 
Private payrolls increased by 1.027 million jobs last month, with retail hiring rising 249,000. Professional and business services added 197,000 jobs, with more than half of the increase in temporary help services. 
Employment in leisure and hospitality increased by 174,000 jobs, stepping down from the 621,000 gained in July. Manufacturing employment rose by 29,000. Construction added 16,000 jobs.

Pence told CNBC the agreement reached this week by the Republican administration would keep the government funded when the fiscal year runs out at the end of the month and clear the way to focus on another coronavirus relief bill.
A Democratic aide in the U.S. House of Representatives said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin agreed this week to keep any stopgap funding bill free of controversial items.
The aide said many details of the temporary spending bill had yet to be resolved, including the duration of the funding and a long list of special changes to current law requested by the White House.
President Donald Trump would have to sign off on any deal. During some past funding fights, he has reversed course on legislation he had initially signaled to support. 
Many federal government operations would have to be suspended on Oct. 1 if Congress and the White House failed to reach a deal by then for at least part of the new fiscal year.

There had been talk of merging a funding bill with a further round of pandemic-related economic relief, but Pence's remarks suggested the two issues would be handled separately.

The jobless rate for Blacks dropped by 1.6 percentage points to 13% in August from 14.6% in July, while the rate for whites dropped at a faster rate of 1.9 percentage points to 7.3% from 9.2% a month earlier. The overall U.S. unemployment rate fell more than expected last month to 8.4% from 10.2% in July.
The 5.7 percentage point gap was the widest since December 2014. One year earlier, in August 2019, the spread had been a record-low 2 percentage points. It was 2.5 points in April, when the U.S. economy shed a record 20.8 million jobs as a result of business shutdowns imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19.

The racial gap in U.S. jobless rates has come under closer scrutiny in the months since the pandemic struck as minorities and women suffered an outsized share of job losses, exacerbating long-standing economic inequality. The widening also occurs against a backdrop of protests against police violence against Blacks, which has become a central issue in the U.S. presidential election campaign.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina could resume international commercial flights in October, a transport ministry source said on Friday, indicating a potential light at the end of the tunnel for one of the world's strictest travel bans due to the coronavirus. 
The start of flights next month would give companies the 30 days they need to prepare for the restart of their operations, the source said, cautioning that higher approval was still pending.
""The president has the final decision,"" the person said. 
Transport Minister Mario Meoni said on Thursday that new passenger and airport protocols for international travel had been fine-tuned and approved by the Ministry of Health, a requirement that the government stated previously for lifting a strict travel ban that was due to expire on Sept. 1. 
""In the next few days, we will be able to announce the return of international flights. All of this takes time because scheduling flights is not easy,"" Meoni said at a public event. 
The ministry would also submit a proposal to President Alberto Fernandez for the restart of domestic flights next month, Meoni added.
Argentina surprised the airline industry and passengers in April when it announced a total ban on commercial airline flights until September, one of the strictest bans in the world. The South American nation has largely been in isolation since March 20 due to restrictions to stop the spread of the virus. 
The government has extended lockdown restrictions, including the flight ban, as it struggles to contain the virus. It reported 12,026 new cases on Thursday, a record daily high, and now has counted over 450,000 total infections. 
Airline industry group IATA criticized Argentina's decision to extend the flight ban, saying the country is now the largest market in the region where aviation remains suspended.
""Continued procrastination by the government will further reduce the country's international connectivity,"" said Peter Cerda, IATA's vice president for the Americas.
""From an industry perspective, we would not want the country to become another Venezuela, which over the years has gone from being one of the key aviation markets on the continent to now having very limited international connectivity,"" Cerda said.

There's plenty for the ECB to chew over at its meeting on Thursday. The euro hit $1.20 for the first time since 2018 - not a big deal if that reflects optimism about the future, something that may be reinforced when EU finance ministers meet in coming days to discuss implementing their 750 bln euro recovery fund. 
But on a trade-weighted basis, the euro is near six-year highs, weighing on prices. Inflation turned negative in August for the first time since 2016 - a red flag for an ECB charged with keeping it near 2%.
Aggressive stimulus due to the COVID-19 shock buys time and no major action is expected. Yet the deflation alarm and a firm euro suggest it won't be long before the ECB acts again. Markets will looking for clues on just when that might be.

China's August trade data should be an added bonus for an economy already firing on several cylinders. Pent-up consumption demand, massive foreign flows into yuan bonds and a rising currency already attest to what is easily the world's fastest recovery from the pandemic. 
Nationalism and Beijing's drive for technological self-sufficiency have fuelled a sizzling IPO and stock market boom. Upcoming lending and money supply data is likely to confirm what bond investors are betting on: China won't ease or tighten in a hurry. 
China's July imports dipped 1.4%. But record inflows of copper and China turning a net aluminium importer for the first time since 2009 shows increased momentum.

3/ IT'S ALL ABOUT LABO(U)R
Less focus on inflation, more on labour markets: That was Fed boss Jerome Powell's message at last month's virtual Jackson Hole summit. Essentially that means the Fed, now aiming for an average, won't worry about inflation exceeding the 2% target, which is seen as giving it room to keep interest rates low as long as it wants. 
That's good news for stock markets, property and other sectors that benefit from cheap money. Inflation seems to have little chance of getting to 2% anytime soon, even though inflation expectations have nudged higher of late. 
Friday's August inflation readings are expected to show core CPI up 0.2% month-on-month after July's 0.6% gain. For 12 months through August, it is expected at 1.2% versus 1% last month. The Fed's preferred gauge - core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index excluding food and energy - was up 1.3% in July. At this rate, asset price inflation might pose a bigger headache for the Fed.

Britain's government apparently sees just a 30%-40% chance of a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union. Little optimism, then, before talks resume on Sept 8. Previous rounds ended in impasse, with each side accusing the other of unwillingness to compromise before the transition period expires at the end of 2020.
The squabbling is over several issues, from fishing quotas to Britain's desire to use state aid to build up its tech sector. And less than a month remains before the Oct. 2 deadline for a deal that must then be ratified by a mid-month EU summit. 
The prospect of no-deal is frightening, given the trillion dollars of annual trade at stake. Failure to progress will mean getting dangerously close to the wire. UK stocks are showing nerves, lagging European peers by 10% year-to-date and Britain's economy may contract more than any other developed nation. Sterling has benefited from dollar weakness but its days in the sun might be numbered.

Yet his reputation as a lieutenant rather than leader has investors wondering if determination will be enough to cement public support and prevent more revolving-door premierships.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Securing agreement on the exact conditions on respecting democracy to attach to the disbursement of European Union funds is the biggest challenge to implementing an EU plan to revive the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic, a senior official said on Friday.
European Council President Charles Michel, who chairs EU summits, spoke to Reuters and five other European news agencies after Hungary refused to grant its final approval to the EU recovery plan without guarantees on a linked mechanism on the rule of law. 
""There is a difficulty with this topic, it's not new. But we made a big step on that in July and we must now continue,"" Michel said of a deal between the 27 national EU leaders this summer on the economic recovery stimulus. 
""When there is a problem, we need to find a solution. And we will find a solution,"" he said, without giving details.
Under the deal, the EU's executive would borrow 750 billion euros ($888 billion) on the market to top up a trillion euros worth of spending under the bloc's joint budget in 2021-27 to help revive growth. 
That still requires approval by the European Parliament, as well as many national parliaments across the EU. The package would also link access to EU funds to respecting democratic principles, which Prime Minister Viktor Orban wants to ensure would not hurt him before granting Hungary's final approval. 
Orban, like his eurosceptic allies in Poland, has long been at loggerheads with the EU over undercutting democracy, and stands accused of undermining the independence of the judiciary, media, academics and advocacy groups in Hungary.
The July agreement was left vague on the rule-of-law conditions to avoid a Polish or Hungarian veto, but the European Parliament wants stronger democratic safeguards. 
The question is set to dominate the bloc's political agenda this autumn, with Spain and Italy that have been hit hardest by the pandemic and hope to secure funds quickly.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis said on Friday that the coronavirus pandemic had ""toppled the shaky pillars"" of a world economic model built on the idolatry of money and domination by the rich and powerful.
In a message to participants of the annual European House-Ambrosetti Workshop, which gathers some 200 top managers, economists, and politicians from around the world, he called for new models that would be more inclusive and reduce social inequality.
He also urged ""an ecological retooling"" of the economy to save the environment and reduce wasteful consumption.
""It (the pandemic) has called into question the scale of values that sets money and power over all else,"" he said.
""It has toppled the shaky pillars that supported a certain model of development,"" he said, adding that social and economic uncertainties had made many people open their eyes to inequality and environmental blight.
He said economics should be the expression of a society that ""refuses to sacrifice human dignity to the idols of finance (and) uses financial resources not to dominate but to serve"".
Francis, who has said any eventual COVID-19 vaccine must not be hoarded by rich countries, is believed to be preparing an encyclical letter - the highest form of papal writing - on what he believes the post-pandemic world should look like.
The event, which takes place in the northern lakeside town of Cernobbio each September, is Italy's version of the annual Davos Economic Forum in Switzerland. This year, it is taking place mostly virtually because of the pandemic.

Apart from a host of Italian ministers, participants include French President Emmanuel Macron, 2016 U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and former U.S. national security advisor John Bolton.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia is standing up to China. Watch closely: It may be a harbinger of things to come, as the world's smaller countries respond to the increasingly coercive Asian economic superpower.
For years, the Australian political and business establishment had a paramount goal: protect and expand this natural resource powerhouse's booming exports to fast-growing China. Iron ore, coal, natural gas, wine and more: Until COVID-19 struck, Australia had a 29-year run without a single recession as it sent its signature goods to the world's voracious No. 2 economy. Canberra's diplomacy came to focus on balancing the Chinese trade relationship with the nation's equally important defense alliance with the United States.
But the paradigm through which the government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison now views China has shifted dramatically, people inside his government told Reuters. The relationship is no longer shaped just by trade, but by a stark view emerging widely inside this continent-spanning country – that Beijing poses a threat to Australia's democracy and national sovereignty.
Discussions about China inside Morrison's cabinet now revolve around the need to preserve sovereignty and fend off Chinese efforts to sway Australian politics, two government sources told Reuters.
Recent steps taken by the prime minister appear to reflect this thinking. He has warned the Australian public about a significant increase in cyber attacks, introduced a national security test for foreign investments, and announced a dramatic jump in defense spending focused on the Indo-Pacific region. Morrison didn't name China when announcing these moves, but government officials said they came in response to Beijing's actions.
Australia has also voiced concerns in recent weeks about what it sees as Chinese disinformation campaigns that seek to undermine democracies; suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong over China's imposition of a draconian security law in the city; and filed a declaration with the United Nations rejecting China's maritime claims in the South China Sea.
Of all the actions taken by Australia in recent months, though, it's the government's lobbying of world leaders in April for an inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic that has most enraged Beijing. The world lined up behind the move, with 137 nations co-sponsoring a resolution at the World Health Assembly for an investigation into the pandemic, which first emerged in Wuhan. Beijing also ultimately backed the resolution. An independent panel, headed by former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, will deliver an interim report in November.
Beijing lashed out angrily, imposing trade sanctions on Australia after the pandemic inquiry move. It suspended some beef imports on a technicality and effectively blocked a $439 million trade in barley by slapping tariffs of 80.5% on the Australian import. China has also launched an anti-dumping probe into Australian wine imports.
In August, a Chinese diplomat drew on Roman history to blast Canberra, comparing Australia's call for an inquiry to the betrayal of Julius Caesar by the assassin Brutus.
China's foreign ministry said Beijing had never interfered in Australia or used coercion against it. Responding to questions from Reuters, the ministry also called on Australia to ""abandon the Cold War mentality,"" do more to ""enhance mutual trust"" and not ""provoke trouble on issues involving China's core interests."" A stable relationship, it said, was in the interests of both countries.
Reuters spoke to 19 current and former Australian government officials and two former prime ministers in examining how relations with China have deteriorated. They provided the first comprehensive account of how the government came to adopt its view that Australia must ""speak up,"" as several ministers have said, about Beijing's actions.
This shift in Australia's position on China began in 2017, the interviews show, before the sharp deterioration in relations between Beijing and Washington, which threatens to trigger a new Cold War. The change has been led in part by a coterie of Australian officials, some with security and intelligence backgrounds, who hold deeply skeptical views of the Chinese leadership and its global ambitions.
In one sign of the times, a bipartisan group of anti-China hawks has formed in the Australian parliament, who dub themselves ""the Wolverines.""
Asked about this shift, Morrison couched his moves with diplomatic care. In a written response to questions from Reuters, he said his government's approach to China has been consistent.
""As with any bilateral relationship, Australia's approach is based on our values and principles, and on a clear-eyed assessment of Australia's national interest,"" he wrote. ""We place great store on our relationship with China and we have not sought to put that relationship at risk.""
Australia had been a great beneficiary of China's economic growth, Morrison said, but ""as countries develop they have a responsibility to uphold a stable, prosperous strategic balance in our region.""
Trade with China remains vitally important to Australia. The stakes are high: Australia has a $172 billion trading relationship with China, and a $51 billion surplus.
It's an uneasy balancing act. In response to Australia's push for a pandemic inquiry, Beijing accused Canberra of ""dancing to the tune"" of Washington. In June, after a fresh threat from Beijing on trade, Morrison said Australia wouldn't yield to ""coercion.""
A visit Morrison paid to Beijing in 2017, when he was Treasurer, set the stage for his stance in the current feud. He came away from the trip convinced his country's trade with the world's second largest economy had two-way benefit. He'd heard from Chinese officials, he told a small group of reporters in Beijing at the time, that Australia's exports of iron ore, which the country produces in vast volumes and high quality, put it in a ""unique position.""
This conviction, that China needs Australia's iron ore, is now buttressing his government's position.
""It is a mutually beneficial relationship,"" Morrison said in his comments to Reuters. ""China’s economy is stronger because they have access to high quality energy, resources, agricultural goods and increasingly services from Australia. And our economy is stronger because we have access to high quality manufactured goods from China.""
So far, China hasn't mentioned iron ore as a potential target for reprisal. For good reason: Australia makes up 60% of China's imports of iron ore, crucial for powering an economy Beijing is trying to get back to full capacity after it was shuttered by the virus.
Despite China's ""bluster,"" it needs Australia, says former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, whose relationship with Beijing became increasingly icy during his tenure from 2015 to 2018.
""If China suddenly came across a huge supply of iron ore, at appropriate grades, that they could extract at competitive prices, that was closer to them, they would be all over it - but there's not,"" he told Reuters. ""Chinese companies do not buy Australian commodities, goods or services because they want to do this struggling little island nation a favor - they do it because it's good value, good quality.""
Responding to a question about its iron ore imports from Australia, China's foreign ministry said trade between the two nations was long established and based on market principles of supply and demand. China hopes Australia will ""do more"" that is ""conducive to friendly exchanges and cooperation,"" the ministry said.
It remains to be seen whether Australia's tougher stance provides a broader model for other mid-sized powers reliant on exports to China, however. Australia's iron ore would be hard for China to replace; other nations may lack such leverage.
One former Australian leader, while supporting a firm position on China, questions the government's handling of the relationship.
Former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said China is difficult to deal with and respects strength, but he is critical of the Morrison government's ""rolling crises"" with Beijing. Being ""hairy chested on China"" has become a competition for advancement in Morrison's Liberal Party, Rudd told Reuters.
""China is never going to impose any economic measures against Australia which damage its own interests,"" said Rudd, a fluent Mandarin speaker and former diplomat in the Beijing embassy. But, he adds, Australia has vulnerabilities: Australian exports beyond iron ore that aren't essential to China could be targeted by Beijing, quickly adding up to an expensive toll.
""The atmosphere in Australia does not lend itself to a reasoned discussion on the China relationship, because you are automatically defined as either a hawk or a panda hugger,"" Rudd said in an interview.
SOURED SENTIMENT
When the pandemic hit, Australia had already decided it was dealing with a more authoritarian and assertive Chinese government under Xi Jinping, and in the long-term needed to reduce its trade reliance on Beijing, diplomats and government officials told Reuters.
The pandemic brought tensions into the open like never before, however. In previous bouts of friction, too, Beijing took punitive economic measures against Australia. But those penalties, such as holding up coal shipments or wine at its ports, were cloaked as customs technicalities.
This time, China's ambassador to Canberra, Cheng Jingye, was unequivocal, threatening in an April 27 newspaper interview that in response to Australia's call for an inquiry, the Chinese public could boycott Australian wine, beef and tourism.
Beijing then cautioned its students against choosing Australian universities, threatening a $27.5 billion market for educating foreign students. Morrison fired back with his strongest language on China since becoming prime minister.
""We are an open-trading nation, mate, but I'm never going to trade our values in response to coercion from wherever it comes,"" he told Sydney radio station 2GB in June.
Public sentiment toward China has soured. An annual poll by the Lowy Institute, a foreign policy research group, found that trust in China among Australians had plummeted to 23%, compared with 52% in 2018. The survey, released in June, found that 94% of respondents supported reducing economic reliance on China.
The government's approach of working with other nations in the region to deal with China enjoys bipartisan support. ""In our relationship with China, as with any country, we must always assert our values and our interests – including transparency and sovereignty,"" the opposition Labor Party's foreign affairs spokeswoman, Senator Penny Wong, told Reuters.
The United States is Australia's major security ally. But with the election of Donald Trump on an ""America First"" platform, the officials who have pushed a tougher line on China have also called for Australia to begin seeking wider alliances with so-called middle powers – countries like Japan, India and Indonesia.
""America under Trump is being seen as erratic, less reliable, and he has the habit of turning on allies from time to time,"" said Turnbull, who endured a tense call with Trump after the president took office in 2017. Trump grew irate when Turnbull asked if Trump planned to honor an agreement with predecessor Barack Obama to accept 1,250 refugees held in Australian detention centers on Pacific islands.
The U.S. Embassy in Canberra declined to comment.
THE ERA OF WIN-WIN
Australia established diplomatic ties with Communist China in 1972, seven years before the United States fully recognized the People's Republic of China.
Trade links with Beijing grew as Australia shipped iron ore, coal and liquefied natural gas to China, fueling the Chinese boom.
The economic relationship peaked with the signing of a free trade agreement at the end of 2015 that lowered Chinese tariffs on agriculture, dairy and wine, and promised to open the door for Australian banking and other professional services to China's restricted market.
But Australia was jolted within months of the signing when Beijing refused to recognise a 2016 international court ruling that China had no historical claim over disputed islands in the South China Sea. The Turnbull government joined Washington in rebuking China.
Canberra was also becoming concerned by growing Chinese attempts at influence in Australia, particularly through political donations from Chinese businessmen to local politicians that had come to light. In December 2017, Turnbull introduced foreign interference laws to parliament. Among the activities the law aimed to curb were the Chinese Communist Party's covert influence over Chinese students on university campuses, interference by Beijing in local Chinese-language media, and attempts by China to shape decisions by Australian politicians, from local councils to federal members of parliament.
A report on these and other Chinese activities prepared by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the country's national security agency, had ""galvanized us to take action,"" Turnbull said at the time.
Beijing reacted furiously to the foreign interference legislation and responded by freezing diplomatic visits. This included an end to annual leaders' visits.
After the 2017 report by ASIO, defense and security agencies took over running China policy, along with key advisers in then-Prime Minister Turnbull's office, three former diplomats said. The foreign ministry, which preferred a lower-key approach, was sidelined.
Cyber intrusions were becoming a major concern. Alastair MacGibbon, Turnbull's special adviser on cyber security and former head of the Australian Cyber Security Centre, told Reuters that China was probing companies to gather intelligence about resources or investment areas to benefit its state-owned enterprises.
""China has very significant capability, and was making strategic grabs of what competitors, friends and foes were doing,"" said MacGibbon, who is now the chief strategy officer at CyberCX, a private cyber security firm.
China's foreign ministry said cyber attacks are hard to trace and Australia needed to show evidence of Beijing's involvement. ""In the absence of evidence, it is very irresponsible to unilaterally hype up cyber attack issues against other countries,"" the ministry said.
RISE OF THE CHINA HAWKS
In August 2018, Australia became the first country to effectively ban Chinese tech giant Huawei from its next-generation 5G telecom network on national security grounds.
Turnbull, who co-founded Australia's first major internet service provider, explained the logic behind the move. ""If Huawei were to provide your 5G network, or a large portion, does that give Huawei the capability to disrupt large parts of your economy? The answer is yes,"" Turnbull told Reuters. ""Do you want to give a foreign state whose attitude to you may not always be benign the capability to inflict harm? The answer is no.""
Mike Burgess, then the head of the nation's technology intelligence agency, the Australian Signals Directorate, had advised Turnbull that the technology risk posed by Huawei couldn't be mitigated, Turnbull said. Burgess previously had worked at the defense intelligence base Pine Gap, a top secret U.S. satellite tracking and missile launch detection station in the Australian desert. Burgess declined to comment.
Australian security officials raised their concerns about Huawei with Washington, which followed Canberra's lead, imposing a ban on the Chinese firm in May last year. Officials also traveled to Britain to explain Australia's position. The British were focused on Russian interference, MacGibbon said, but the Australian officials argued they also needed to understand the risk from China.
Having initially decided Huawei would be allowed a limited role in its 5G network, the UK government reversed course in July, announcing it would ban the company from the country's 5G network by ordering telecom firms to remove its equipment by 2027.

Huawei Australia said it did not engage in any efforts to interfere in the country's telecommunication networks and was taken by surprise when Turnbull moved against the company. ""Up until that point we were in the process of competing for 5G business with all Australian network operators,"" Jeremy Mitchell, Huawei Australia's chief corporate affairs officer, told Reuters.
China's foreign ministry said the Australian government banned Huawei ""under the pretext of national security without any factual basis.""
One of the officials engaged with London over Huawei was Andrew Shearer, who moved from the Office of National Intelligence to be Morrison's cabinet secretary last year. He has become a powerful voice on China policy in the prime minister's inner circle and has urged closer engagement with Japan and India, government sources told Reuters. In June, Australia sealed a strategic partnership with India that granted the two countries access to each other's military bases and allowed for Australia to provide India with rare earths, metals that are crucial to defense and space programs.
Shearer worked in Washington at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), an influential defense and security think tank, between 2016 and 2018. It was a time when attitudes towards Beijing were hardening among U.S. Republicans and Democrats, said CSIS senior vice president for Asia, Michael Green. Appearing before the U.S. House Committee on Armed Services in 2017, Shearer told members China was intent on undermining the liberal world order and the institutions that underpinned it.
Shearer worked on issues including China's ""gray zone"" interference in the East and South China Seas - aggressive moves that stopped short of war, such as erecting and fortifying artificial islands. ""We were looking for ways to harness alliances and partnerships to deter Beijing from escalating further,"" said Green, who formerly served on the U.S. National Security Council.
That thinking was evident in Morrison's recent announcement that Australia will boost defense spending by 40% over the next decade. Morrison said his defense strategy would bolster Australia's ability to respond to ""operations in the 'gray zone' - falling below the threshold of traditional armed conflict.""
Shearer declined to comment for this story.
Richard Maude, a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, led the government's 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper, a major rethink of a world where China and the United States were more likely to clash.
""Working with other middle powers, in our own region and globally, makes a lot of sense for Australia in the current environment. It helps show China we are not alone in our concerns,"" said Maude, a former intelligence agency director-general, who left the department of foreign affairs last year. ""It is also a helpful rebuttal of China's narrative that Australia simply does what the United States asks of us.""
The sharpest public criticism of China has come from a bipartisan group of parliamentarians who call themselves the Wolverines, inspired by a group of teenagers who resist a Soviet invasion in the 1980s movie Red Dawn. The group, none of whom are in the cabinet, coalesced in 2019.
The most prominent Wolverine is former special forces soldier and Liberal Party lawmaker Andrew Hastie, who chairs parliament's intelligence oversight committee. In August last year, Hastie compared the West's approach to an authoritarian China to the failure of France to stop the advance of Nazi Germany.
China's foreign ministry said that some Australian politicians and think tanks had for some time been ""spreading rumors to discredit China and severely poisoning the atmosphere of bilateral relations.""
Australia has pushed back against Chinese diplomats who object to public criticism of Beijing. Chinese envoys have been told by their Australian counterparts that domestic political debate and the media are beyond the control of the government in a democratic political system.
'AN AWAKENING'
When China threatened economic retaliation over Australia's call for a coronavirus investigation in April, the phones started ringing in Trade Minister Simon Birmingham's office as industry heads called to express concern. But publicly, Australian business leaders stayed largely quiet.
Iron ore miners have also been largely restrained, as they continued to ship Australia's most valuable resource, extracted from the red, dry dirt of the Western Australian Pilbara region, to Chinese steel makers. In June, Australian iron ore shipments hit a record AU$9.9 billion ($7.2 billion), pushing annual exports past AU$100 billion ($73.2 billion) for the first time, as the only rival supplier, Brazil's Vale, suffered COVID-19 shutdowns.
""China needs our commodities - we do have some of the best iron ore in the world. It does mean Australia comes from a position of strength,"" Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia chief executive Paul Everingham told Reuters. At the same time, he added, the iron ore industry is uncomfortable with the newly ""adversarial climate.""
In the wake of the 2018 diplomatic freeze, the national security agency and the ministry of foreign affairs held briefings for executives in industries exposed to China. The executives have been told that complaining would provide ammunition to Beijing for propaganda against the Australian government, said an agriculture industry source. Companies were advised instead to work with Australian officials to comply with the minutiae of Chinese red tape and expose Beijing's trade retaliation for what it was.
The government also told industry it was seeking alternative markets for Australian goods, had negotiated access to Indonesia, and was in talks with Britain, Europe and India.
The muted response from the business community is in contrast to 2018, when chief executives complained loudly that the Turnbull government's dispute with China risked damaging trade, and implored him to fly to Beijing to fix it.
""So much of the Australian business community, faced with criticism or a difference of opinion between Australia and China, will side with China,"" Turnbull recalls of the situation he faced as prime minister. But, he adds, ""there has been an awakening.""

698,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 07:51AM ET</span>","California lets more businesses open, but for some it's too late","By Sharon Bernstein
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The day California finally allowed hair salons to reopen after months of pandemic restrictions should have been a happy one for the sisters who own Hourglass Salon + Boutique in Sacramento. Instead, they spent it hauling out boxes and figuring out how to tell customers they were closing. 
“Our hearts are shattered,” Erin Banville and Melissa Burgoon wrote to clients.
The popular business faced thousands of dollars in rent payments, and the state’s order allowing hair salons to serve customers indoors came days too late.
Nationwide, half of small businesses said sales were down by 25% or more in August from pre-pandemic levels, according to a survey of 20,000 companies by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB).
Twenty-one percent said they would not be able to stay afloat for more than six months, and another 19% said they would not make it if current conditions lasted for another year. Five percent said they would not be able to make it another two months.
Hardest hit are retail, travel, hospitality, and business and personal services companies, said Holly Wade, the NFIB's director of research. The problems go beyond states' temporary closure orders or business restrictions. Consumers have changed their habits, ordering retail goods and food online, working from home and fearing to patronize many businesses in person out of health concerns, she said.
With so many people working from home, small businesses that cleaned office buildings have had little or no work for months, Wade said, while restaurants have had to downsize and retool to offer food to go.
""It's been an incredibly challenging situation for many of our small businesses,"" said Marni Sanders, chief executive of the Yuba Sutter Chamber of Commerce, which serves an area north of Sacramento. ""They were not equipped for something like this. They didn't have reserves, they were essentially living from paycheck to paycheck.""
Jeff Rossman, who owns two restaurants in San Diego, was breaking even earlier in the pandemic after retooling to handle mostly orders to go, requiring fewer employees, and participating in a state program to feed seniors. But reopening for indoor dining with restrictions on capacity would still be too expensive.
""It's going to be touch and go for a while, and I think you're going to see a lot of restaurants closing,"" Rossman said. 
Denise Duncan, the owner of AT Industrial Products, which makes equipment to clean up combustible dust from metals used in manufacturing, said orders have dropped by half due to the double-whammy of a cyclical turndown and plummeting demand as the pandemic impacts clients' production and needs.
""I might have 90 days before I gotta figure out how to shut it down and move on,"" she said.
Like other small business owners, Duncan is hoping Congress expands the Paycheck Protection Program, which helped many small businesses keep up with payroll expenses during the pandemic's early days.
To be sure, some sectors of the economy are booming. Construction and home improvement companies are busy upgrading homes and gardens as people focus on their live-work spaces and low interest rates spur home sales.
A Reuters analysis showed that demand is up for grocery items as people work from home and cook more. But demand for products and services used by office-workers is down, from business clothing to takeout coffee.
Christopher Thornberg, director of the Center for Economic Forecasting at the University of California, Riverside, said the pandemic and accompanying business and social restrictions accelerated changes already pressuring some businesses, particularly brick-and-mortar stores.
But many businesses will ultimately recover, he said. Women still want to get their hair done, so the salon industry will come back.
Such optimism offered little solace to Banville and Burgoon as they shut down Hourglass, packing hair products into boxes and pulling out the jewelry, blouses and dresses that Burgoon sold from a boutique tucked into the salon's waiting room.
A day after California said it would allow salons to reopen for indoor services, Banville started seeing clients in a room she rented in a group working space. Burgoon was looking for a job she could do as a mom with two young children.

""We were thriving,"" Banville said of the salon, where stylists were often booked months in advance. ""This is a decision that was made for us.""

699,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>","Bank of Canada to revisit inflation-targeting, shadowing Fed: Reuters Poll","By Mumal Rathore
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada will remain in a holding pattern and likely follow the U.S. Federal Reserve's path of reviewing its current inflation-targeting framework to protect the economy from the fallout of the coronavirus, a Reuters poll showed.
Just before the Fed's landmark decision to change its approach towards inflation rate targeting, BoC Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri said the ongoing pandemic would test public confidence in the central bank's 2% inflation rate target due for a revision in December 2021 . 
Over 30 economists in a Reuters poll predicted the BoC, which next meets on Sept. 9, would keep interest rates unchanged at 0.25% until at least the end of 0222.
But 13 out of 19 economists said the BoC would review its inflation framework before the 2021 deadline, with most seeing the central bank moving towards targeting an inflation average, like the Fed has done.
""If the BoC does not follow the Fed towards greater flexibility, a relatively tighter policy stance could become counterproductive to maintaining inflation and economic stability,"" said Beata Caranci, chief economist at TD. 
""We suspect that road won't be crossed and the BoC will evolve its policy mandate. It may choose not to follow the same direct objective (as the Fed) but the end result of lower for longer will be the likely outcome.""
Inflation was expected to average 0.7% and 1.6% this year and next, according to the poll of economists. They forecast core inflation, which the BoC looks at closely when deciding on rates, would remain well below 2% throughout the forecast horizon.
That outlook comes even as the government and central bank have delivered billions of dollars in stimulus to help shield the economy from the coronavirus fallout. Over 130,000 people have been infected in Canada.
But not all economists polled expected the central bank would change its inflation-targeting framework.
""The BoC's behaviour – as reflected in measures of inflation expectations – has been more akin to treating 2% as the ceiling even after prolonged periods of undershooting,"" said Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank.
""Perhaps (it would) consider heightened emphasis upon how 2% is an average target within the symmetrical 1-3% range."" 
The central bank should maintain its existing monetary policy and slowly exit from its quantitative easing programme, a smaller sample of economists said.
""Evolution is fundamental to achieving economic and financial stability. The economy and its structure are not static over time, nor should there be an expectation of the same from policy leaders,"" added TD's Caranci.

MADRID/GDANSK (Reuters) - Fearful of catching the coronavirus while also feeling the pinch from recession, Spaniards are increasingly shunning public transport and turning to cheap old cars, industry data shows, in a trend that risks more toxic emissions.
Sales of vehicles older than 20 years jumped 31% year-on-year in July and August to nearly 44,000 cars, according to data from the Institute of Automotive Studies.
The average price of those purchases was around 1,400 euros ($1,655.36), vehicle sales portal Sumauto said, with some cars going for as little as 500 euros.
As sales for old cars jumped, sales of new units rose a modest 1.1% year-on-year in July and fell 10% in August. 
At the same time, public transport traffic plunged 40% during the summer compared with the same period last year, Sumauto added, quoting the association of public transportation operators.
With the economy set to shrink at least 9% in 2020 and unemployment ticking up in August after a brief recovery in July, many Spaniards are looking to save money.
But more use of old cars could be negative for the environment and respiratory health. 
""Old cars, even when they were new, contaminated more as environmental rules were much less strict 15 or 20 years ago,"" said Adrian Fernandez, a transport expert at Greenpeace Spain. After many years on the road these cars are now even more polluting, he added.
""It's a step backwards on air quality. This means negative consequences for respiratory ailments, of which COVID-19 is one.""
Spain has recorded 488,513 cases of the virus, more than any country in Western Europe, and is suffering a second wave.
On Thursday the Health Ministry reported 3,607 new cases, down from a peak of around 10,000 last Friday. It also reported another 13 deaths, pushing total fatalities up to 29,234.

701,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Hungary central bank sees slower recovery, stimulus near its limits: sources","BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic will likely be slower than previously expected, two central bank sources told Reuters, adding that the bank was nearing its limits with tools to stimulate the economy.
The sources said earlier hopes for a V-shaped recovery were dashed after second-quarter data showed the economy contracted by an annual 13.6% , the worst in central Europe and nearly double the pace the bank had flagged in June.
The National Bank of Hungary (NBH) cut its base rate by a combined 30 basis points to 0.6%  in June and July, and maintained its forecast for economic growth in 2020 of 0.3% to 2% - whereas economists in a Reuters poll projected a contraction of 4% to 5%.
The bank's optimistic forecast and hopes for a quick recovery rested on two key assumptions, that government investments would soften the blow to the economy and that a second wave of the pandemic can be avoided, the sources said.
They said the bank was now revising its GDP forecast.
""We had assumed that investments, especially government investments would kick in, but the second quarter turned out really miserably,"" one of the sources said. ""My gut feeling is that there could be a 5% to 7% downturn this year, but the new forecast is only being drawn up.""
The sources said a recovery shaped like a ' Nike  (NYSE:NKE) swoosh' now looked a more realistic scenario. Asked about the remarks, the central bank's press office declined to comment beyond the latest Monetary Council policy statement.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday that Hungary must take steps to kick-start the economy.
Orban's government spent hundreds of billions of forints this year on a job saving programme and medical equipment needed during the pandemic and has flagged further possible measures that could push the budget deficit to 7% to 9% of GDP.
Hungary registered 459 new coronavirus cases on Friday, its highest daily tally since the outbreak of the pandemic, which has led to 621 deaths in the country. 
The bank has launched a 1 trillion forint ($3.3 billion) quantitative easing programme, a 1.5 trillion forint scheme to provide small businesses with cheap loans and a 450 billion forint corporate bond programme to help larger businesses.
""Based on our current knowledge, we are pretty much at the limit,"" the second source said when asked about the bank's room for manoeuvre. ""The QE programme is ongoing, while there is still abundant financing available in the cheap loans scheme.""
Based on the latest tally, companies have received 467 billion forints of financing under the scheme, with many opting to refinance earlier, more expensive loans.
""The central bank has room to increase the size of these lending programmes but what good is it if even the current amount is not exhausted? Demand is rising very cautiously and banks are more conservative,"" one of the sources said.
The central bank has ruled out further cuts in its base rate and one source said any rate easing was now an ""absolute taboo.""
The bank's wiggle room is also limited by high inflation, seen stuck at the top of the bank's 2% to 4% target range in August , and renewed falls in the forint (EURHUF=D3) since Hungary's worse-than-expected second-quarter GDP data.
""Next year is still bound to be difficult and we cannot know what the second wave brings and how long it will last,"" one source said.

702,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 06:47AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday, September 4th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Global markets steady after Thursday's sell-off but the froth continues to come off overheated tech names. The U.S. is expected to have added 1.4 million jobs in August, but a bunch of those are one-off hires for the 2020 census. The U.S. government won't shut down in October, and oil prices bounce after a brief panic about global oversupply. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, September 4th.
1. Global markets stabilize after rout
Global markets steadied after the worst sell off in months on Wall Street on Thursday, as participants came around to the view that the incident was more specific to overheated tech stocks than to global developments.
While markets in the Asia-Pacific region all ended lower, losses of around 1% were nowhere near as severe as those seen in the U.S. on Thursday. European bourses, which had already participated in the downward move on Thursday, rebounded strongly, with bank stocks in particular lifted by the announcement of talks to create the biggest lender in Spain.
The dollar and other traditional havens, meanwhile, failed to gain much traction, with the dollar index settling into a range well below 93 and gold futures up only 0.4% at $1,945 a troy ounce.
2. Jobs report puts fresh light on recovery
The U.S. will publish its official labor market report for the month through mid-August, after a barrage of conflicting signals from other high-frequency data from the labor market this week.
Expectations for the key nonfarm payroll growth range from below 750,000 to over 2 million, indicating the high degree of uncertainty among analysts. The average forecast, according to analysts polled by Investing.com, is around 1.40 million, which would represent a slowdown from July’s 1.76 million but still solid progress, given that the reporting period coincided with a surge in Covid-19 cases across the South and West that put a brake on economic reopening.
However, the number is likely to be inflated by government hiring for the 2020 Census. Private hiring, as measured by ADP’s monthly survey, fell well short of expectations on Wednesday. Jobless claims data released on Thursday, meanwhile, showed over 29 million Americans still claiming benefits as of the middle of August.
3. Stocks set to open mostly higher but froth tech stocks still under pressure
U.S. stock markets are set to open to open modestly higher, stabilizing after Thursday’s sharp sell off.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow 30 futures contract was up 130 points or 0.5% while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 0.3%.
Nasdaq 100 futures were, however, down another 0.4%, reflecting the extent to which yesterday’s rout was essentially a correction of a rally in a handful of tech stocks rather than a wholesale change in sentiment about the economic outlook.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, whose 8% fall broke records yesterday for the biggest ever one-day loss in market capitalization, was down another 0.1% in premarket, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was down 1.2%, extending its 9% on Thursday. Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock was down 1.4%, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock was down 0.2%.
Elsewhere, a survey by consultancy Smart Insider, cited by the Financial Times, showed that U.S. large-cap company executives sold $6.7 billion of their own stock last month, while the number of sellers topped 1,000, reaching its highest level since August 2018.
4. No government shutdown in October
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed not to close down the government in October, at the start of the new fiscal year, according to the Associated Press.
The news again points to at least a modicum of cooperation between the two sides as they continue to argue over the scale and shape of a new round of stimulus measures (the necessity of which will be on show in today’s labor market report).
Senate Republicans are due to hold a vote on their proposed $500 billion package next week, according to Bloomberg. That’s still a long way from the latest $2.2 billion package by Pelosi.
5. Oil rebounds after oversupply fright; rig count eyed
Crude oil prices rebounded smartly as a brief bout of panic about looming oversupply subsided.
By 6:35 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 1.0% at $41.75 a barrel, rebounding from what was only a half-hearted test of the $40 level that has been the bottom of its range for the last three months. Brent futures, the international benchmark, were up 0.7% at $44.38 a barrel, while gasoline futures were back over $1.20 a gallon.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House has asked U.S. government agencies for extensive details of any funding that seeks to counter China's global influence and business practices, or supports Beijing, amid growing tensions between Washington and Beijing.
According to an Aug. 27 White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) document seen by Reuters, the OMB directed U.S. agencies to submit ""cross-cutting data on federal funding that aids or supports China, or that directly or indirectly counters China's unfair competition and malign activities and influence globally.""
China denies it engages in unfair competitive practices.
The document, titled ""Strategic Competition with China Crosscut,"" does not say how the information will be used other than that it will ""inform policymakers"" of the myriad ways U.S. government spending involves China. 
The United States and China have grown antagonistic toward each other with disagreements that stretch from a two-year-old trade war, to the Trump administration blaming Beijing for a lack of transparency about the spread of COVID-19.
The sweeping budget data request will be used to help policymakers and notes all funding should ""reflect strategic priorities"" when responding to China.
Some U.S. programs and spending under review dates back a decade or more. The document directs federal agencies to respond by Sept. 21.
A spokesman for OMB confirmed the agency effort, telling Reuters that ""to ensure that the United States remains strong and in a position of strength against rival nations like China, OMB has asked federal agencies for all funding meant to counter China, or which could aid China.""
The memo includes instructions on how to submit both classified and unclassified U.S. spending details and seeks details of all U.S. government funding directed for spending inside China.
The White House document asks for data for all U.S. government funding used to ""counter malign Chinese influence or behavior incongruent with American interests.""
It cites as examples ""funding for programming to counter the One Belt One Road (OBOR) or Belt and Road Initiative (BRI); funding for military operations, equipment and infrastructure, the primary purpose of which is to deter aggressive Chinese behavior.""
It also seeks details of ""secondary"" U.S. efforts on China like ""marginal contributions which were necessary to maintain a U.S. lead over China in terms of voting power within key international organizations"" and funding for other U.S. efforts.
The document also seeks data on U.S. government funding for programs whose primary purpose is to counter Chinese technological prowess in key sectors like 5G and wireless communications, semiconductors, artificial intelligence and machine learning, quantum computing, cyber and system security, advanced manufacturing and robotics, autonomous and electric vehicles, biotechnology, advanced energy, and space technologies.
The White House sought details of spending on technical assistance from U.S. government experts, bilateral funding for the U.S.-China Clean Energy Research center and any other U.S. bilateral economic assistance programs. 
It also seeks data on ""HHS (Health and Human Services) funding for CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), NIH (National Institutes of Health) and other programming in China.""
The request also seeks details on any spending that ""would overall contribute to Chinese GDP or technical capacities, including to Chinese government or military entities, State-owned commercial or industrial entities and entities functionally directed by"" Chinese government leadership as well as grants or credit provided by U.S. supported international organizations.
Agencies must submit data on 2019 and 2020 budgets enacted into law, the 2021 Trump budget proposal and 2022 agency budget requests.
The budget review is just the latest effort that could lead to more actions against China. 

Last week the United States blacklisted 24 Chinese companies and targeted individuals it said were part of construction and military actions in the South China Sea, the first such U.S. sanctions move against Beijing over the disputed strategic waterway.

704,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>","US, Taiwan seek 'like-minded' democracies in supply chain shift from China","TAIPEI (Reuters) - The United States and Taiwan said on Friday they were seeking ""like-minded"" democracies to join a shift in global supply chains during the coronavirus pandemic, as Washington looks to accelerate a move away from economic reliance on China.
The Trump administration is taking action on multiple fronts to rebalance U.S. economic ties with China, including executive orders aimed at ensuring domestic production of key products and using ""Buy America"" requirements and incentives to persuade U.S. firms to bolster domestic supply chains.
China has decried this as a politicised attempt at ""de-coupling"" the world's two largest economies that will never succeed.
De facto U.S. ambassador in Taiwan Brent Christensen, speaking in front of his Japanese, European Union and Canadian counterparts, Taiwan's foreign minister and the visiting Czech Senate speaker, said everyone in the room was connected by their shared values, like freedom of the press and religion.
""These are the shared values that will inform how we reinvent the supply chains of the future,"" Christensen said.
""Helping economies, sectors and companies build out secure supply chains will require a coordinated effort from all of us.""
Taiwan has also been keen to encourage its companies home from China - which claims Taiwan as its own territory - or to move factories elsewhere.
Foreign Minister Joseph Wu took an indirect swipe at China, saying the pandemic had caused counties to wonder what would happen if their key industries were controlled by ""another country that does not honour the values of rule of law, freedom, democracy and transparency"".
""Going forward, we will work with like-minded partners to establish reciprocal industrial ties that lead to joint prosperity, instead of coercion, exploitation and expansionism,"" Wu said.
""I see tremendous potential for closer cooperation between Taiwan and like minded democracies, from Europe, Asia and North America.""

To China's anger, the Trump administration has stepped up its support for Taiwan, even though like most countries it does not maintain formal diplomatic ties with the island.

""I consider it quite likely that additional monetary easing will be appropriate in order to achieve a sustained return of inflation to the 2% target,"" Saunders said.
Growth was likely to disappoint relative to the BoE's forecasts published last month, Saunders said.
He said an ongoing recovery was the result of a ""benign window"" - the combination of huge government spending and the relaxation of lockdown measures.
""This window may now be closing,"" Saunders said, adding that a downside scenario for the economy would be ""very costly"".
On Wednesday, BoE Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden and another rate setter, Gertjan Vlieghe, also warned the economy could suffer more damage from the coronavirus crisis than spelt out by the central bank last month.
Many economists expect the BoE to announce a latest ramping-up of its bond-buying programme in November.

A government memo, first reported by Bloomberg News on Thursday, warned there are “critical gaps” in its Brexit plans, while logistics experts have highlighted the threat of chaos at ports and shortages of key products if a critical IT system isn’t finished in time.
“We’ve kept the supply chains going, and I’m absolutely confident we will do that again in the future,” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 4 on Friday. “There will always be concerns about what if this happens, what if that happens. Our job is to work with people like the hauliers to make sure that we’ve got the best systems in place.”
Pressure is growing on the government as the end of the transition period draws closer. From Jan. 1, full customs controls will be imposed on goods traveling from the U.K. to the EU whether or not the two sides reach a trade deal this year.
With the key government app -- which trucks heading for the EU will have to use -- still under development, the logistics industry is seeking urgent talks with Shapps, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove to press its concerns.
The opposition Labour Party also criticized the government’s preparations, saying businesses still lack details about how to prepare for Brexit more than four years after the referendum.
“This is the latest example of Tory incompetence and raises real concerns about the risk of border chaos in four months’ time,” Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Rachel Reeves said in a statement. “The government should be working at maximum pace to deliver the oven-ready deal they said they had negotiated.”
The Conservatives have also drawn criticism over their handling of building Brexit lorry parks, facilities which will be used to hold trucks attempting to cross into the EU without the rights customs paperwork. This week, Johnson’s government gave itself sweeping powers to start construction in 29 different council areas across England without needing local approval.
“Worryingly, instead of addressing the concerns of businesses, the government is looking to build lorry parks across the country without consulting local communities,” Reeves said. “The government must urgently come forward with a plan to put workable solutions in place.”"

Hungary registered 459 new COVID-19 infections on Friday, its highest ever daily tally.
But Orban told state radio that unlike in March, when all schools closed under a national lockdown, the government will keep classes open and decide on any closures on a case-by-case basis.
""We await the second wave fully armed,"" Orban said. ""We must not just keep the economy operational - we need to be able to boost the recovery.""
Gross domestic product data have shown a year-on-year contraction of 8.2%-13.6% in countries across central Europe. Hungary was the worst hit with its second-quarter GDP falling 13.6%.
Orban said the government would meet later in the day to discuss rules in order to ""allow the greatest possible freedom with all the important restrictions"".
Hungary has closed its borders to foreigners since Sept. 1 to curb a rise in coronavirus cases. Returning Hungarian citizens can leave a 14-day quarantine only if they provide two negative COVID tests.
Subsequently, Hungary decided to exempt tourists visiting from three neighbouring states, provided they test negative for COVID-19 before arriving, prompting a rebuke from the European Commission.
As of Friday, Hungary had reported 7,382 coronavirus cases with 621 deaths. The number of new cases has surged this week just as Hungary started a new school year.
According to a presentation of epidemology experts working for the government, the virus was spreading mainly among young people, with the average age of infected at 32 1/2 years at the end of August. 

The experts proposed banning bigger events, providing free testing, fast contact detection and making masks mandatory in closed spaces.

Britain left the EU on Jan. 31 but talks have so far made little headway on agreeing a new trade deal by the time a status-quo transition arrangement ends in December.
Britain’s desire to use state aid to build up its technology sector means that Johnson's top ministers are unwilling to budge in negotiations on state aid, The Times said.
""Inside No 10, they now think there is only a 30 to 40 per cent chance that there will be an agreement,"" James Forsyth, political editor of The Spectator, wrote in a column. ""The sticking point isn’t fish — I’m told that there is a 'deal to be done' there — but state aid.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy likely shrank more than previously estimated in the second quarter as capital expenditure took a hit from the coronavirus pandemic, a Reuters poll showed, highlighting the challenge policymakers face in averting a deeper recession.
Separate data is expected to show household spending was hit by a bigger annual drop in July than in June, a sign the COVID-19 pandemic is keeping consumers cautious about shopping.
The slew of data due out next week underscores the daunting task the new prime minister, to be elected in a ruling party leadership race later this month, faces in seeking to contain the pandemic while avoiding restrictions on business activity.
""Unless a fundamental solution to the pandemic is found, we'll likely face a trade-off between steps to prevent the spread of the virus and efforts to revive the economy,"" said Shunsuke Kobayashi, chief economist at Mizuho Securities.
""The focus will be on an extra budget likely to be compiled during the autumn Diet session. But the impact on growth will be short-lived as long as we face the trade-off,"" he said.
Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to have shrank an annualised 28.6% in April-June, more than a preliminary reading of a record 27.8% contraction, according to the poll on 19 economists.
The main culprit behind the revision is an expected 3.1% drop in capital expenditure, a bigger fall than a preliminary 1.5% decline, the poll showed.
The Cabinet Office will announce the revised GDP data at 8:50 a.m. on Sept. 8 Japan time (2350 GMT on Sept 7).
Household spending in July likely fell 3.7% from a year earlier, more than a 1.2% drop in June, hit by bad weather and social distancing policies to contain the pandemic.
Core machinery orders, a leading gauge of capital expenditure, likely rebounded, rising 1.9% in July after a 7.6% decline in June, offering some hope of a pick-up in corporate spending appetite, the poll showed.
The household spending data is due out 8:30 a.m. on Sept. 8 Japan time (2330 GMT Sept 7), and the machinery orders data at 8:50 a.m. on Sept. 10 Japan time (2350 GMT Sept. 9).

The move comes after Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $3.9 billion to Malaysia to settle a probe into its alleged role in the scandal involving the fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), which counts former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak as one of its co-founders.
The U.S. Department of Justice estimates $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped raise.
The units - based in London, Hong Kong and Singapore - had pleaded not guilty in February and the bank has consistently denied wrongdoing.
""Goldman Sachs International Ltd, Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC and Goldman Sachs (Singapore) are therefore discharged amounting to an acquittal from all four charges made against them,"" Bernama quoted High Court judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan as saying as he granted prosecutors the request.
Lawyers for Goldman Sachs and the prosecution could not be immediately reached for comment. 
As part of its deal with Malaysia, Goldman has paid $2.5 billion in cash and guaranteed the return of $1.4 billion in 1MDB assets seized around the world. 
At least six countries including Switzerland and Singapore have opened money laundering and graft probes into 1MDB in a scandal that implicated Najib and high-level officials of the fund. 

In July, Najib was found guilty of corruption and sentenced to 12 years in prison in the first of several trials he faces over 1MDB. Najib has maintained that he is innocent.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's parliament will consider recommendations to overhaul how the country's central bank operates, raising market fears that Bank Indonesia will lose independence and its policymaking would be at risk from political interference.
WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED?
A panel of internal experts issued recommendations this week to revise the 1999 central bank act to parliament's legislation committee, known as Baleg.
Recommendations include expanding Bank Indonesia's (BI) mandate to cover economic growth and employment, on top of managing the value of the rupiah.
The panel has also recommended that cabinet ministers be given voting rights at monthly monetary policy reviews. 
It also suggested the formation of a Monetary Council to supervise BI. The finance minister and a minister in the economics sector would have seats on the supervisory council. A similar arrangement was in place before the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s.
BI could also be permitted to purchase government bonds in the primary market, zero-interest bonds under certain conditions or provide temporary financing for the government. The central bank has only recently resorted to some of these purchases, in response to the pandemic.
Currently, BI has a six-member board of governors, who are recommended by the president and elected by parliament. They can come from any background, but five existing members are career central bankers and one has a long career as economist.
WHY ARE LAWMAKERS CONSIDERING CHANGES?
Talks about revising the 1999 law have gained traction amid tough negotiations between the government and BI on a $40 billion financing deal for a COVID-19 package.
Achmad Baidowi, deputy chair of Baleg, told Reuters the government and parliament members decided in July to make revising the law a priority for this year. 
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
Baleg will now form a bill to go before parliament that should be completed in the current sitting period that ends Oct. 9 and, if approved, proposed to the government, Baidowi said.
The final bill may not include all of the panel's recommendations, he said.
Jakarta-based lawyer Arisakti Prihatwono said the government could decide to reject the bill, but otherwise it typically takes over a year to work on legislation, though priority bills can be accelerated.
HOW HAS THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONDED?
President Joko Widodo has pledged BI would remain independent, while finance minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati has so far declined to comment because she said her ministry had not yet been consulted on the proposals.
BI also declined to comment.
However, senior government and central bank sources told Reuters some officials back expanding BI's role to support economic growth.
WHAT DO FOREIGN INVESTORS THINK?
Analysts are worried in case BI's independence is threatened or it has too much room to print money.
""The inclusion of additional and more varied panelists (on the monetary policy committee) is not unusual and could lend itself to rigorous and consensus-based policy decisions and add a layer of oversight,"" said Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service Senior Analyst Anushka Shah.
Shah, however, warned that if the government's representation in the policy-making committee became too dominant it would put risk at BI risk of political interference or delay an exit from pandemic-led debt monetisation. 

But some economists also perceive BI has had a too limited role in supporting the economy during the pandemic.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said most state and territory leaders have recommitted to opening up the economy by December, but failed to secure an immediate agreement to lift border restrictions that are crippling the economic recovery.
The nation has fragmented along state lines, with many leaders barring travel from the two most-populous states of New South Wales and Victoria due to community transmission of Covid-19. That’s complicating efforts to steer the economy out of its first recession in almost 30 years.
Morrison is pressing for the states to agree on a definition of Covid “hot spots” -- to enable borders to reopen but allow more targeted controls on inter-state travel. Seven out of the eight state and territory leaders recommitted to open up the economy by Christmas, something that was originally envisaged by the end of July. The state of Western Australia, the powerhouse of the nation’s resources industry, was the holdout.
“In the absence of a vaccine, we may have to live this way for years,” Morrison told reporters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The AFL-CIO is planning to file labor complaints against Mexico this month under the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement's labor enforcement mechanism, the U.S. union's president said on Thursday.
Richard Trumka, speaking during a virtual event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, said one of the cases would come under the ""Facility-Specific Rapid Response Labor Mechanism"" that could halt exports from individual factories found in violation of labor rights provisions.
He said the AFL-CIO is working with the U.S. Trade Representative's office on the complaints and is gathering information about the arrest and detention of Mexican labor attorney and activist Susana Prieto in the northern industrial state of Tamaulipas and harassment of other labor organizers. 
Prieto, who last year helped organize unprecedented strikes at several dozen manufacturing plants, was arrested in the border city of Matamoros in June and charged with threats, inciting a riot, coercion and crimes against public servants.
She denied the charges and was released on July 1, the day the USMCA took effect. But a judge banned her from entering Tamaulipas, home to dozens of factories in the U.S.-Mexico supply chain.
Trumka said the ban for Prieto, along with harassment of other labor organizers in the same state, shows that complying with USMCA labor standards ""is not going to be easy.""
""We have tremendous concerns with Mexico's ability to enforce their laws,"" Trumka said.
He did not provide details on the specific claims to be made in the cases, which would likely be the first under the agreement's new mechanism.
""We think when we do the rapid response (case) and if we're able to block products from coming in, it will get their attention real fast and they will understand that they will have to change and comply with the law,"" Trumka said.
A USTR spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment on Trumka's remarks.
Trumka also said he was concerned that U.S. Labor Department has been slow to disburse funds agreed upon in the USMCA deal to help Mexico strengthen its labor enforcement capacity.

The tougher labor enforcement standards were demanded by Democrats in the U.S. Congress in late 2019 to secure approval of the trade deal, which replaced the 26-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement.

Most respondents in a Bloomberg survey expect an increase in the 1.35 trillion-euro ($1.6 trillion) pandemic bond-buying program by December, with a median prediction of 350 billion euros. The Governing Council is seen keeping policy steady when it meets virtually next Thursday, but some analysts expect President Christine Lagarde to hint at the possibility of more action in the future.
While the initial rebound from the coronavirus recession has been strong, a range of issues are clouding the outlook. Infections have been rising in the wake of summer travel and loosened restrictions, and indicators suggest the economy is starting to run out of steam.
In another worrying signal for policy makers, euro-area inflation turned negative last month for the first time in four years, with the core rate hitting a record low. The ECB is set to publish new forecasts next week that will help determine how much stimulus the economy still needs.
“Data have been good enough to not warrant any new policy action in September but uncertainty about the virus, growth and the inflation path remains,” said Bas van Geffen, a quantitative analyst at Rabobank. “The ECB will reconfirm that it remains ready to adjust policy as and when necessary.”
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“The Governing Council may indicate next week that downside risks have intensified, signaling monetary policy could be loosened further before the end of the year.”
-- David Powell and Maeva Cousin. Read the ECB PREVIEW.
Most economists surveyed expect the pandemic purchase program to be extended by six months to the end of 2021. Respondents also said the ECB will make available about 210 billion euros more through March via its various bank-lending programs.
Interest rates are seen remaining unchanged until at least the end of 2022. The deposit rate currently is at -0.5%.
Many of those predictions might be at risk if the euro continues to appreciate. The common currency climbed above $1.20 this week for the first time in two years after jumping 12% since the start of coronavirus lockdowns in March. It’s since pared some of those gains after ECB chief economist Philip Lane said the exchange rate matters for monetary policy.
A stronger euro puts downward pressure on prices by cutting the cost of imports. The speed of the single currency’s rise should be the chief concern, according to economists, though they added that it’s largely driven by forces outside the central bank’s control.
The Federal Reserve’s commitment to keep interest rates at rock-bottom, as well as the European Union’s historic agreement on a joint fiscal response to the crisis, are seen as some of the reasons for the euro’s strength against the greenback.
“Up to now, the euro’s appreciation doesn’t change the inflation outlook considerably,” said Kristian Toedtmann, an economist at DekaBank in Frankfurt. “But with its rhetoric, the ECB should guard against an upward trend of the exchange rate.”
In the longer-term, economists expect European policy makers to follow the Fed in adopting a strategy that allows for temporarily overshooting its inflation target of around 2%. The majority of respondents said the ECB will probably change the current target of “below, but close to, 2%” to one that aims to reach this value as an average over time.

718,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 06:10PM ET</span>",Fed policymakers signal comfort with higher inflation,"By Ann Saphir and Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - In the week since the Federal Reserve made a landmark shift in its approach to monetary policy, details are emerging on what it could look like in practice, with two Fed policymakers on Thursday saying they'd be comfortable with leaving interest rates near zero even if inflation rises to levels not seen on a sustained basis in some 30 years. 
Remarks from a number of Fed policymakers in recent days suggest that a shift to a more accommodative stance in pursuit of higher inflation isn't imminent and that most feel the next move to support the economy needs to come from Congress. 
""Partisan politics threatens to endanger additional fiscal relief,"" the president of the Chicago Fed, Charles Evans, told the Lakeshore Chamber of Commerce in Hammond, Indiana, in one of the sharpest rebukes yet from a Fed policymaker to lawmakers who have been at loggerheads for months over the size of a new relief package. ""A lack of action or an inadequate one presents a very significant downside risk to the economy today,"" Evans said.
But once the coronavirus is under better control and unemployment has come down somewhat, he said, the Fed may need to shift its accommodative policies into higher gear. 
That push, he said Thursday, could take the form of promising to keep interest rates pinned near zero until inflation reaches 2.5%, well above current low levels and modestly above the U.S. central bank's inflation target of 2%.
""I'd be comfortable with inflation going up to 2.5% as long as we were trying to average off very low inflation rates,"" Evans told reporters on a call.
The U.S. central bank announced last week that it was revising its approach for setting monetary policy to focus more on addressing shortfalls in employment and less on inflation.
Evans was the architect of an approach the Fed adopted in 2012 in which it vowed not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 6.5% as long as inflation was projected to rise to no more than 2.5%. 
""I think the way that we did it in 2012 is not unattractive, (but) our environment is somewhat different now because we are saying we want to average 2%,"" Evans said.
In a similar vein, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he would not be concerned with inflation going to about 2.4%. 
""As long as we see the trajectory moving in ways that suggest that we are not spiraling too far away from our target, I'm comfortable just letting the economy run and letting it play out,"" Bostic said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Thursday.
While the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, the core PCE index, measured above 2.4% a few times in 2006 and 2007, the last time it did so for a sustained period was in the early 1990s.

Fed policymakers are in complete agreement that the Fed should not raise rates preemptively as unemployment falls ""unless you see inflation,"" Bostic said.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) said on Thursday that it will delay until early next year changes to its privacy policy that could reduce ad sales by  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and other companies targeting users on iPhones and iPads.
The delay could benefit Facebook, which last week said the changes to the iOS 14 operating system would render one of its mobile advertising tools ""so ineffective on iOS 14 that it may not make sense to offer it.""
Apple announced new privacy rules in June that were slated to take effect with the launch of its iOS 14 operating system this fall. Among them is a new requirement that advertisers who employ an Apple-provided tracking identifier, or other tools that have a similar function, must now show a pop-up notification asking for tracking permission.
Facebook said last week it would quit using the tool that requires a prompt in its own apps but did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
Apple said Thursday that developers will still have the option to use the prompt when iOS 14 arrives.
“When enabled, a system prompt will give users the ability to allow or reject that tracking on an app-by-app basis,"" Apple said in a statement. ""We want to give developers the time they need to make the necessary changes, and as a result, the requirement to use this tracking permission will go into effect early next year.” 
Digital advertising firms will have space in the notification to explain why they are seeking tracking permissions, but they expect most users will decline to grant that permission. Apple said Thursday that it will not begin enforcing use of the prompt until early next year.
Other iOS 14 privacy features, such as new notifications that will show which apps have recently accessed features such as GPS location or the device's microphone, remain on track. 
Advertisers are instead gearing up to use a new advertising system that Apple has created and claims is more private because it does not provide detailed information about individual users. Advertisers have said that system is likely to generate less revenue.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Former Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla has dropped her bid to head the Washington-based Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and criticized a process seen favoring U.S. President Donald Trump's pick to lead the institution.
""To continue with our national aspiration would be equivalent to endorsing a process that I do not consider convenient either for the IDB or for the Hemisphere under the present conditions,"" said Chinchilla on Thursday.
Chinchilla's jibe appeared directed at the United States, which has broken with decades of tradition to nominate its own candidate, Trump adviser Mauricio Claver-Carone, known for his hard-line stance on Venezuela and Cuba.
Claver-Carone, the favorite to win the top spot, would become the first person from outside Latin America to lead the Washington-based bank, a smaller cousin of the International Monetary Fund.
The IDB, founded in 1959, is currently led by Colombia's Alberto Moreno, who is set to step down in September.
The U.S. ""decision is also an extremely worrying signal for the governance that a financial institution like the IDB should have,"" Chinchilla said in a letter to the government of Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado.
Several countries, including Argentina, Mexico, Costa Rica and Chile, and European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell have called for a delay on the vote, citing concerns about having an IDB leader from outside the region.
But Claver-Carone has pushed back against the regional opposition to his candidacy, saying 17 countries had given him public support.

""The more the process advanced, the more difficult it became for me to justify why I was participating in it,"" said Chinchilla.

""I'd be comfortable with inflation going up to 2.5% as long as we were trying to average off very low inflation rates,"" Evans told reporters on a call. Evans was the architect of an approach the Fed adopted in 2012 in which it vowed not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 6.5% as long as inflation was projected to rise to no more than 2.5%. 
""I think the way that we did it in 2012 is not unattractive, (but) our environment is somewhat different now because we are saying we want to average 2%,"" Evans said.

(Reuters) - The head of the Chicago Federal Reserve on Thursday called on Congress to deliver more fiscal aid and signaled U.S. monetary policy would be eased further and interest rates kept at ultra-low levels for years to help the economy recover its pre-pandemic strength. 
Even with further government stimulus, and assuming progress in controlling the coronavirus, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans predicted U.S. output won't return to pre-crisis levels until late 2022. At that point, he forecast, unemployment will still be between 5% and 5.5%. He added that inflation will likely remain below the Fed's 2% goal for some time.
""Given my outlook, I expect this means highly accommodative monetary policy will be appropriate for some time to come,"" Evans said in remarks to the Lakeshore Chamber of Commerce in Hammond, Indiana. 
But monetary policy, he said, takes ""second-chair"" to fiscal policy in the current downturn, which he pointed out resulted from planned shutdowns of economic activity in order to contain the spread of the virus. While some parts of the economy have been able to return to near normal, others have not, and even businesses that have enjoyed strong sales may be hurt now that much of the first round of fiscal relief has expired, he said.
If partisan politics blocks lawmakers from agreeing on a new fiscal package, he said, that ""presents a very significant downside risk to the economy today.""
A new Fed policy framework adopted last week promises to tackle ""shortfalls"" in employment and aim for above-2% inflation to make up for periods below that level, effectively ruling out any rate hikes under Evans' forecast until well beyond 2022. 
""It is important that our future monetary policy actions are true to the principles laid out in the new consensus statement,"" he said. 
Indeed, Evans signaled he would like to ease policy further to bolster the pandemic-hit economy, which is showing some signs of improvement though overall remains weak. 
One way to do so, even with rates already pinned near zero, would be to promise to keep them there, using massive bond purchases if needed, until inflation or unemployment reach specific targets.
""I think that articulating outcome-based forward guidance for the rate path and asset purchases could be beneficial in the not-too-distant future,"" he said.
The Fed is scheduled to hold its next policy meeting in mid-September.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's understanding of the relationship between employment and inflation has shifted and determining when to raise interest rates will depend more on the trajectory of inflation than the exact level, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on Thursday. 
Bostic said he would not be concerned with inflation going above the Fed's goal of 2%, reaching up to about 2.4%, if prices remain stable. ""As long as we see the trajectory moving in ways that suggest that we are not spiraling too far away from our target, I'm comfortable just letting the economy run and letting it play out,"" Bostic said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. 
The U.S. central bank announced last week that it was revising its approach for setting monetary policy to focus more on addressing shortfalls in employment and less on inflation. Bostic said policymakers noted that the relationship between inflation and employment was weaker from 2012 to 2018 than it had been in previous decades. 
Now, Fed officials are more comfortable with leaving rates low until there are signs of higher inflation or of financial instability, he said. ""I think we're going to be willing to be more stimulative than perhaps we have been historically,"" Bostic said. 
Asked about whether the Fed's low rate policy was inadvertently boosting asset prices, Bostic said he thinks policymakers should be concerned about asset bubbles
However, he noted that the U.S. economic recovery has been uneven and that restaurants, hotels and entertainment businesses are struggling. Tightening monetary policy too soon could hurt workers in those industries, he said. 

""I think it would be a mistake for us to take off some of the relief and support because those places will have a much harder time getting back on their feet,"" he said.

The National Federation of Independent Business said Thursday that a net 21% of small firms in August were planning to create new jobs, up 3 percentage points from the prior month and the fourth straight increase. Some 33%, the most since March, said they had open positions they were unable to immediately fill.
“The small business labor market is recovering and moving in the right direction,” William Dunkelberg, chief economist at the NFIB, said in a statement. “However, there is still uncertainty and many small businesses are counting on additional financial assistance.”
The poll offers some hope in a labor market where employment more broadly remains well below pre-crisis levels. Even so, lawmakers have been at a standstill in negotiations over legislation to provide further fiscal relief to the unemployed and small business, and the reduction in aid could restrain any job gains.
A net 18% of firms in the NFIB survey said they raised compensation in August, up 3 percentage points from a month earlier, yet well below the 36% share before the onset of Covid-19 and economic shutdowns.
The Labor Department on Friday is projected to report a 1.35 million increase in total payrolls in August and an unemployment rate of 9.8%, according to the median estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists.

(Reuters) - The U.S. economic recovery continued to hunt for traction over the past week with high frequency data on employment and retail traffic moving at a stodgy pace, pointing to a long trip back to normal.
Data released Friday on the August unemployment rate will show just how U.S. labor market repair has proceeded since a surprisingly strong jump in jobs in May and June, followed by more muted job growth in July.
Initial claims for unemployment benefits fell to 881,000 last week, a drop of 130,000 from the week before. However nearly 30 million Americans were claiming some form of unemployment benefit in mid-August and, excluding statistical changes to account for seasonal patterns, the number of initial claims has risen for three weeks, noted Indeed https://www.hiringlab.org/2020/08/31/job-postings-through-august-28 Hiring Lab economist AnnElizabeth Konkel.
""Nearly six months into the pandemic, this is an alarming trend,"" she wrote in an analysis. 
Data provided by time management firm Homebase https://joinhomebase.com/data showed employment falling slightly at a sample of small businesses through the week ending Aug. 30. Company data since January show the limits of labor market repair so far, with small businesses across cities stuck in a range with around 80% of the workers they had on average in the first two months of the year.
Shifts worked at a broader set of industries continued to expand only slowly, according to data provided by Kronos https://www.kronos.com/about-us/newsroom/update-us-workforce-activity - a result consistent with disappointing results from payroll provider ADP this week pointing to slower-than-expected job growth in August.
Graphic: Employment in real time - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/REOPENING/gjnvwxamxpw/chart.png
JOB POSTINGS UP, HEALTH METRICS IMPROVE
Adjusting for the seasonal return of school staff, Kronos data showed the growth in shifts at retail stores, manufacturing plants, health facilities and elsewhere grew just half a percent for the week ending Aug. 30, still 10% short of pre-pandemic levels. While that was pulled down by closures related to Hurricane Laura, it was the sixth consecutive week of shift growth below 1% and ""much slower than what we’ve experienced at any other point in the recovery,"" said Dave Gilbertson, vice president of strategy and operations at Kronos.
By many measures the recovery does continue to chug forward through a persistent pandemic, based on a variety of high frequency data series economists and policymakers have turned to for insight on the health crisis. 
New job postings aggregated from online and company websites by Chmura http://www.chmuraecon.com/blog Economics are now just below their March 1 level, a sign companies still see reasons to bring employees back.
New York Fed data tracking overall gross domestic product continued a steady rise, while an Oxford http://blog.oxfordeconomics.com/topic/recovery-tracker Economics recovery index including health, economic and social statistics increased for the fourth straight week. It was edging near where it was in mid-March when the economic impact of the pandemic was just being felt.
But the details are telling. The index's health and mobility metrics both improved - the daily growth in cases has eased in recent weeks and people are moving about more.

August ended with roughly 1.45 million new cases in the month, down from July's record increase of around 1.95 million, according to a Reuters tally https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-USA/0100B5K8423/index.html.
But people are driving, still not flying, noted Oxford chief U.S. economist Gregory Daco, and ""disappointingly, demand and employment have stalled ... Stronger restaurant activity was offset by weaker retail, recreation and hotel demand along with reduced credit card spending."" 
Data from restaurant reservation site OpenTable has shown a rise in activity at restaurants in recent weeks. But it remains just over half what it was as of the first of March, two weeks before a declaration of national emergency and orders in many states and cities for businesses to close temporarily.
Combined, the data point to a vexing problem for the economy going forward. Even as states lift restrictions on commerce, stores try to reopen and health measures improve, consumers may not be so fast to resume their old ways, and firms may adapt to scaled-down demand by bringing fewer workers back.
Overall spending for example was higher in July than it was a year ago, and data on visits to retail locations from cellphone tracking firms Unacast https://www.unacast.com/covid19/covid-19-retail-impact-scoreboard and Safegraph https://www.safegraph.com/dashboard/covid19-commerce-patterns have steadily improved. Through last weekend Safegraph in particular showed retail foot traffic near where it was on March 1. 
But the expiration of government unemployment insurance benefits alone has sapped roughly $18 billion a week in income from consumers, many of them in low- to middle-income households that are more likely to spend the dollars they receive.

Here are details of the plan:
SHIFT TO GREENER ENERGIES
The government has earmarked 30 billion euros to finance a transition towards more environmentally friendly policies, including:
* 11 billion euros steered towards the transport sector, including 4.7 billion euros for the railways to increase freight traffic and add more regional lines. Nearly 2 billion of that will go to cover losses during a coronavirus lockdown at state rail company SNCF. Bike lanes in towns and cities are another priority.
* 6 billion euros for the renovation of public buildings and private homes
* 2 billion euros over two years for the hydrogen industry, seen as a next-generation energy alternative to fossil fuels. The aim is to invest 7.2 billion by the end of the decade.
* 2 billion euros for incentives to buy electric cars and 2 billion euros for research and development of more environmentally friendly airplanes.
* 1.2 billion euros to help farmers move into more environmentally friendly agriculture. 
BOLSTERING FRENCH COMPETITIVENESS
The plan ring-fences 35 billion euros to make the economy more competitive. It includes:
* 20 billion euros of business tax cuts over two years
* 1 billion euros of direct aid for industrial projects, including 600 million euros to help firms repatriate business
* 11 billion euros to top up an existing long-term investment programme over two years.
SOCIAL COHESION, JOBS
The plan earmarks 35 billion euros for ""social cohesion"", including 15.3 billion to create 160,000 new jobs and protect workers whose positions are under threat, as well as more vocational training and apprenticeships. 
* Nearly half of the support for jobs (6.7 billion) will go towards helping the 750,000 youngsters entering the labour market amid the slump. It includes backing for companies hiring young people and apprentices, and the creation of 200,000 vocational-oriented training places. 
* 6.6 billion euros for a long-term reduced work programme. 
* 1 billion euros to train redundancy-threatened employees in new skillsets
* 1 billion euros for training in sectors the government wants to promote, such as clean energy.

PARIS (Reuters) - France will spend 100 billion euros to help pull its economy out of one of Europe's worst coronavirus-induced slumps, under a recovery plan that revives pro-business reforms championed by President Emmanuel Macron with a greener tinge.
The $118 billion stimulus equates to 4% of gross domestic product, meaning France is ploughing more public cash into its economy as a percentage of GDP than any other big European country, an official said ahead of its formal launch later on Thursday.
France's recession, marked by a 13.8% second quarter GDP contraction that coincided with a COVID-19 lockdown and expected to generate an 11% drop in 2020 as a whole, has also been one of the region's deepest.
Focused mainly on boosting companies and running over two years, the stimulus package earmarks 35 billion euros to make the economy more competitive and 30 billion to promote greener energy policies.
The rest will go on supporting jobs, training and broader social initiatives.
""This recovery plan aims to keep our economy from collapsing and unemployment exploding,"" Prime Minister Jean Castex said on RTL radio.
He said the government aimed to create at least 160,000 jobs next year under the plan.
Macron is banking on the plan returning the euro zone's second biggest economy to pre-crisis levels of activity by 2022 - re-election year should he decide to run again - after what is expected to be its worst post-war recession.
However, it does little to directly support the traditional the engine of French growth, consumer demand. By contrast, neighbouring Germany launched a 130 billion euro stimulus in June with a cut in value added sales tax.
Instead, France is betting that, by supporting jobs, the plan will give consumers the confidence to start spending the 100 billion euros in extra savings that they built up during the two-month lockdown.
With already flagged cuts in business taxes worth 10 billion euros in both 2021 and 2022, its timeline would restore Macron's record on the economy while putting back on track a pro-business agenda that has foundered under a pushback by powerful unions and, latterly, the coronavirus crisis.
GREENING THE ECONOMY
The new public funds are focused on the industrial, construction and transport sectors, all which suffered during one of Europe's strictest lockdowns.
Much of the new investment seeks to accelerate a transition away from fossil fuels, which Macron has made a priority since his ruling party suffered losses to environmentalists in municipal elections this year.
""It's good but this can't be limited to two years, we need to keep it up for 10 years,"" said lawmaker Mathieu Orphelin, who left Macron's party last year to set up a more environmentally focused party. 
Rather than grand new projects, much of the new investment will go into the transport sector and the aging rail network specifically, while about 6 billion euros is slated for making public buildings and homes better insulated.
The hydrogen industry - used to store and transport energy created by wind turbines and solar panels - will get 2 billion euros over two years, a sector that Germany is also betting heavily on with plans to invest 9 billion euros by 2030.

732,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>","Investors snap up corporate debt, pushing some real yields below zero","By Karen Brettell and Kate Duguid
(Reuters) - More U.S. corporate bonds are paying negative inflation-adjusted yields, as expectations that interest rates will stay near historic lows send investors seeking higher payouts in riskier assets.
The ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA U.S. corporate index for bonds maturing within five to seven years <.MERC3A0>, for example, is paying negative real yields for the first time since 2013.
And bonds issued by Apple Inc (O:AAPL) in August, maturing in 10 years <037833DY3=>, yielded only 1.16% as of Wednesday, compared with expected inflation of 1.72% per year over that time period.
Driving the moves are investors shifting into lower-rated debt expecting that the Federal Reserve will keep yields on short- and intermediate-term Treasuries at rock-bottom levels for years as it grapples with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Bond yields move inversely to price. 
That outlook was reinforced last week, when Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed would allow periods of higher inflation before raising rates.
While the returns on shorter-dated corporate debt are at all-time lows - as measured by the ICE BofA one-three year U.S. corporate index <.MERC1A0> - they still beat what investors can expect on Treasuries with similar maturities.
“When the Fed lowers its interest rates it really just kind of forces investors to take on risk,"" said Eric Souza, senior portfolio manager at SVB Asset Management. ""Investment grade credit and asset-backed securities is where you may start to pick up that positive net yield.” 
Fed programs, including unprecedented Treasury and corporate bond purchases, and its commitment to holding rates near zero is seen as effectively providing a backstop for shorter-dated debt. But the low yields are also making it harder for investors to generate income.
The move into corporate debt is ""exactly what the Fed had planned when they were pushing investors out the maturity and credit spectrum,” said Vishal Khanduja, director of investment grade fixed-Income portfolio management and trading at  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV) in Boston. “Go on, take more risk, because we are going to control the yield curve and the credit curve from here.""
Bond yields have also been weighed down by companies increasing their cash cushions and holding back from investing in higher-risk projects until the economy picks up.
“On the real economy side, the opportunities for investing in high returns are not really there,” said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income in Newark. “As a result, that liquid cash goes into the market where at least you can adjust if the world changes.”
The Fed's commitment to letting inflation run higher before raising rates, meanwhile, has helped hold up inflation expectations, even if market participants remain doubtful that the U.S. central bank will hit its 2% target anytime soon, having missed this goal for decades.

“Longer term though I still think the market’s anticipating a rather sluggish recovery and therefore somewhat benign inflationary pressures,” Gary Pollack, managing director fixed-income at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management in New York.

LONDON (Reuters) - British trade minister Liz Truss has reversed an earlier decision to remove meetings she held with an influential free-market think tank from the public record, a letter written to the opposition Labour Party showed on Thursday.
Two meetings and a dinner with the Institute of Economic Affairs were removed from government-published transparency data in August after the department said they were held in a personal capacity, not in her role as trade minister.
That prompted sharp criticism from Labour, who accused her of trying to hide the meetings and wrote to Truss seeking to determine whether she had broken the ministerial code of conduct which covers the disclosure of meetings.
On Thursday, one of Truss's junior ministers replied to Labour to say that the meetings would now be reinstated on the public record, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters.
""The Secretary of State (Truss) was not immediately aware of these changes made at the end of August, and has now carefully considered the appropriate Cabinet Office guidelines,"" Graham (NYSE:GHM) Stuart wrote in the letter.
""Sometimes it is not entirely clear-cut whether an event is 'political’ or is independent of a Minister's official responsibilities. However, in the interests of full transparency, she has asked that these entries are to be reinstated as per the original departmental publication.""
The Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) is widely regarded as one of Britain's most influential right-leaning think tanks. It promotes free-markets and has argued strongly for a clean break from the European Union since the 2016 Brexit referendum.
The department originally said the meeting had been included due to an administrative error.
Labour's trade policy chief Emily Thornberry said Truss had been caught out, and that there were further questions to be answered about the meetings, including who she met and what was discussed. 
""Behind this shambolic farce, there is a serious issue,"" Thornberry told Reuters. 

""The Cabinet Office rules exist to stop secret lobbying, dodgy dealing, and favours for cronies. Those rules are an important part of our democracy, and not for the first time, Liz Truss has been caught out apparently trying to get around them.""

2 Macron launches big stimulus plan 
French stocks hit their highest level in nearly two months as President Emmanuel Macron’s government formally unveiled a 100 billion-euro ($118 billion) stimulus package.
The package, which will be 40% financed by the proposed EU Recovery Fund, aims to cut business taxes by over 20 billion euros over 10 years, one of the central policies that Macron was elected on in 2017 but has been unable to push through so far.
By 6:15 AM ET, the benchmark CAC 40 was up 1.6% on the day, having earlier risen as much as 2.0%.
3 Stocks set to pause for breath; Tesla's under pressure again 
U.S. stock markets are set to open slightly lower, adopting a more cautious tone ahead of the weekly jobless data after setting yet another new high on Wednesday,
By 6:15 AM ET, the Dow 30 futures contract was down 46 points, or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 0.4% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 0.9%.
Stocks likely to be in focus on Thursday include cyber-security firm Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), which was down 7.4% in premarket trading on profit-taking after a quarterly update that failed to live up to stretched expectations.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is also under pressure, down 6.5% after U.K. investment fund Baillie Gifford, one of its longest-standing institutional investors, was forced to divest some of its position due to portfolio concentration concerns.
4. Dollar extends rebound as eurozone momentum slips
The dollar continued its comeback against the euro after the latest round of purchasing manager indexes suggested a sharp loss of economic momentum in August.
IHS Markit’s composite PMI for the euro zone fell to 51.9 from 54.9 in July, as a second wave of coronavirus infection stymied attempts to keep the summer tourist season alive. The U.K., which went into lockdown later than the rest of Europe, managed to eke out another gain in its composite PMI, but IHS warned of increasing numbers of companies preparing to lay off staff as the government’s furlough scheme approaches its end. Eurozone retail sales also fell in July, Eurostat reported.
The EUR/USD was down 0.2% at $1.1833, after the Financial Times reported that a number of ECB officials were starting to be concerned at its rise. An interview by ECB board member Isabel Schnabel with Reuters contradicted this view, however.
5 Oil slumps as oversupply fears re-emerge
Oil prices extended their declines on growing concerns that the market is falling into oversupply.
The market has worked for the last couple of months on the assumption that output restraint from OPEC and its friends, combined with a rebound in global fuel demand, would rapidly eat into stockpiles accumulated in the first half.
However, U.S. government data released on Wednesday indicated a disturbing drop in U.S. gasoline demand, while other government numbers also show jet fuel consumption levelling off at less than half of its levels from a year ago.
Reuters energy columnist John Kemp noted that the contango in dated Brent, the very front end of the physical market, was now at its steepest since June 1.
U.S. crude futures were down 2.1% at $40.65 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 1.8% at $43.65 a barrel.

Britain has prioritised striking a trade deal with the United States as it seeks to carve out new business relationships around the world following its exit from the European Union, and with it all EU-negotiated trade deals.
""I can announce today that the next round (of talks) will start next Tuesday, the 8th of September,"" Hands told parliament.
The prospect of a U.S. deal is clouded by a November presidential election and the possibility that a new administration with new priorities might take over. 
However, Hands sought to downplay that risk.
""In terms of the U.S., clearly ... we talk with all parts of the U.S. political system. We make sure that senators, members of Congress, governors from both parties right the way across the United States ... buy into a future UK-U.S. free trade agreement.""
Britain's top five targets for post-Brexit trade deals are the U.S., Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the EU. 
Ministers said that a deal with Japan was expected to be finalised in the next few weeks, having already missed an end of August target.
The department also said the next round of trade talks with Australia will begin on Sept. 21.

738,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>",U.S. Job Gains Seen Hanging On in August With Tougher Road Ahead,"(Bloomberg) -- The battered U.S. labor market probably saw a fourth month of improvement in August, but chances of further outsize gains are diminishing without the widespread stimulus payments and small-business aid that have sustained incomes and spending.
Economists project Friday’s jobs report will show the unemployment rate dropped below 10% for the first time since March, with employers adding 1.35 million people to payrolls, a figure boosted by the Census Bureau’s hiring of about 240,000 temporary workers to help conduct a decennial count that’s been delayed by the pandemic.
August’s gains likely reflect additional rehiring from businesses that have reopened as the pandemic’s surge eased, while the expiration of supplemental unemployment benefits in July may have motivated some Americans to look for jobs.
At the same time, the improvement marks a further moderation from prior months and would still leave payrolls more than 11 million short of pre-pandemic levels, with the jobless rate almost three times as high and weekly figures showing as many as 27 million Americans claiming jobless benefits. In fact, people looking for work may be increasingly discouraged by a distressed market, limiting job gains, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) economist Alexander Lin.
Moreover, the cuts to stimulus are seen as having a broader effect of limiting spending that supports jobs and the economy. About one in 20 small firms say they expect to permanently shut down in the next six months, according to the latest Small Business Pulse Survey by the Census Bureau.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“The August employment report could deliver the last positive payrolls print before job losses strike again. ... For reported net hiring to keep rising, the recovery in the labor market must be robust enough to overcome seasonal factors calling for strong gains over the coming months. The seasonal impact starts kicking in as early as August.”
-- Yelena Shulyatyeva and Eliza Winger
Lawmakers are at an impasse over stimulus negotiations, and that could mean further job losses as businesses close for good, with payrolls at risk of shrinking as soon as September. It could make Donald Trump’s road to re-election even tougher, with the president already trailing challenger Joe Biden in polls.
“The longer we go along without some sort of stimulus the higher the risk that we get a slowdown in terms of any job gains and could actually even go into reverse,” said Justin Weidner, an economist at Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB). “It’s completely possible that that happens in September.”
A slew of layoff announcements by major companies including MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) International, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co. and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc. also implies weakness in the coming months. In recent weeks, global corporations have announced more than 200,000 job cuts or buyouts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, suggesting that furloughs implemented early in the pandemic are becoming permanent.
Payroll-services provider Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ:ADP). said Wednesday that private U.S. firms added 428,000 jobs in August, less than half of what economists had forecast.
Any gains in August are likely to be partially offset by declines in education jobs as many schools remain virtual, which means fewer bus drivers, cafeteria workers and teachers are needed, according to Bloomberg Economics. Some parents may leave the workforce altogether to manage child care.
Also, the Census jobs added in August are temporary, with data collection scheduled to end on Sept. 30, meaning that October will show a decline in government employment.
“It will be important to focus on private payrolls to make sure Census workers aren’t obscuring the underlying trends,” said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at jobs website Glassdoor.
One bright spot for the labor market might be construction, as low borrowing costs and demand for more space prop up the housing market.
“We’ve seen some pretty strong data out of the housing sector and we think that will lead to pretty steady hiring in August,” said Lydia Boussour, senior economist at Oxford Economics.
Ultimately, the labor-market trend depends on whether America can get a better grip on Covid-19 infections that still number in the hundreds of thousands each week, even if the pace has eased from July.
If furloughed workers get rehired as businesses reopen, that will prop up payroll gains, but those reopenings depend on control of the coronavirus, Glassdoor’s Zhao said.
“The virus still controls the trajectory of the economic recovery,” Zhao said. “If things worsen in the fall as schools reopen, then it’s entirely possible that we can see a worsening of economic conditions in the fall and in the winter.”

Altmaier, speaking to the trade committee of the European Parliament, said a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and former European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker in July 2018 had largely prevented an escalation of tensions, but not solved all problems.
The two parties have a long-running dispute over subsidies for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and its European rival Airbus. The World Trade Organization gave the United States the right last year to hit the EU with tariffs on $7.5 billion of EU products and is set to determine EU retaliation rights in the coming weeks.
Altmaier said both sides had an interest in resolving their differences over these subsidies, adding the European Union had put forward proposals for doing so.
""I am, as before, confident that it will be possible to avoid a great escalation. If our partner does not want this, then we will naturally protect European interests,"" he said.
Altmaier referred to talks he had had with former trade commissioner Phil Hogan, who sorted out a mini trade deal with the United States to remove duties on U.S. lobsters before his resignation over a trip to Ireland.
""We will continue these talks with all the necessary seriousness. There are the first positive signals and we hope that we can strengthen them,"" Altmaier said. 

The EU is still subject to U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminium, but Washington has not so far carried through a threat to impose tariffs on EU cars. The two sides are also in dispute over EU plans to tax digital services companies.

The Food and Agriculture Organization's food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 96.1 points last month versus 94.3 in July.
The Rome-based FAO also said in a statement that worldwide cereal harvests remained on course to hit an annual record in 2020.
The agency's cereal price index rose 1.9% in August from the month before and 7% above its value a year earlier. 
Among the major cereals, sorghum, barley and rice prices rose the most, FAO said. Maize also climbed strongly, pushed up by concerns over U.S. production prospects following recent crop damage in Iowa.
The vegetable oil price index climbed 5.9% month-on-month, returning to around the levels registered when the coronavirus crisis hit the world at the start of the year. 
Palm oil was buoyed by expected output slowdowns in major producing countries, which, combined with firm global import demand, were expected to result in lower inventory levels. 
Average sugar prices rose 6.7% from July, reflecting forecasts of a reduction in production due to unfavourable weather conditions in the European Union and Thailand. Strong import demand in China also helped push prices higher. 
By contrast, the dairy index was little changed on the month, with falls in cheese and whole milk powder offset by stronger butter and skim milk quotations.
The meat index was also largely steady, with bovine and poultry prices in retreat while pig meat prices rose after four consecutive months of declines, as Chinese imports jumped.
FAO revised down its forecast for the 2020 cereal season by 25 million tonnes, largely due to expectations of a lower maize production in the United States. 
However, despite this reduction, the agency still expected a record harvest this year of almost 2.765 billion tonnes, up 3% on 2019 levels. 
""Record maize harvests are forecast for Argentina and Brazil, while global sorghum production is expected to grow by 6% from the previous year. Worldwide rice production in 2020 is also expected to reach a new record of 509 million tonnes,"" FAO said.

The forecast for world cereal utilisation in 2020/21 hit 2.746 billion tonnes, up 2% on the 2019/20 level. The estimate for world cereal stocks by the close of seasons in 2021 was 895.5 million tonnes, down 33.4 million tonnes since July.

IHS Markit's final services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 52.5 from its 13-month high of 55.6 in July.
That was higher than a flash reading of 50.8 and it marked the second month in a row that the services index was above the 50 mark dividing growth from contraction.
The final composite PMI covering both the services and manufacturing sectors eased to 54.4 from 55.3 the previous month. That was higher than the flash figure of 53.7.
IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said the survey data showed that the economic progress in August was only gradual and predominantly driven by domestic demand, which itself was weakened by job losses during the pandemic.
""However, the picture on the employment front is starting to look a little more encouraging, with some signs of hiring in the service sector accompanied by an easing rate of retrenchment across manufacturing,"" Smith added.
He also pointed to the government's latest decision to expand the Kurzarbeit shorter-hours work scheme until the end of next year, which is expected to further stabilise the labour market and with it domestic demand.
The German economy contracted by a record 9.7% in the second quarter as consumer spending, company investment and exports all collapsed at the height of the pandemic.

The government on Tuesday forecast the economy would shrink 5.8% in 2020, less than its previous outlook of a 6.3% downturn althouth still the biggest contraction since World War Two.

The Treasury said its latest five-yearly review was designed to ensure the UK's terrorism reinsurance market worked effectively and in the public interest.
It will consider whether the level of risk sharing between the state and private firms is appropriate and whether its rules should be updated, given ongoing growth of the terrorism reinsurrance market, the ministry said.
The reinsurance fund, set up in 1993, acts as a backstop to insurers paying out claims on property damage and business interruption.
It is financed by the insurance industry with government backing, and pay outs depend on the British government deeming an attack to be terror-related.

The country’s potential growth rate could fall to about 3.5% in 2030 if it decouples with the U.S., Bloomberg Economists Tom Orlik and Bjorn van Roye wrote in a note. That’s down from the current forecast of 4.5%, which assumes relations remain broadly unchanged.
Read the research: Xi’s Nightmare - U.S. Rift May Crush GDP to 1.6%
Such a decoupling -- defined as ending the flow of trade and technology that boosts growth potential -- would have a much larger impact on China than on the U.S. as China gains more from cross-border exchanges of ideas and innovations. The U.S. potential growth rate would be 1.4% in 2030 instead of the current forecast of 1.6%, the research estimates.
In this scenario, China’s productivity growth will slow due to the stop in technology transfer, and capital spending could also be weaker. However, the results won’t be catastrophic as the country has substantially narrowed its technology gap with advanced economies over the last 20 years, the study published Thursday argued.
“If China moved to increase domestic funding for research and development, and expanded its ties with other advanced economies, it could hope to offset a significant amount of the drag,” the economists wrote.
China already looks to be preparing for less connection with the global economy. President Xi Jinping’s new strategy positions the domestic economy as the main driver of growth, seeking to insulate the nation from a slowing global economy and rising hostility. While the details still need to be fleshed out, it’s clear China wants more self-reliance in advanced manufacturing and technology innovation.
China would face even more disastrous consequences if the U.S. can coordinate its key allies, such as Japan, South Korea, Germany and France, to also decouple. In that case, China’s growth potential could fall to 1.6% in 2030, and it’d be harder for Beijing to offset with countervailing policies, according to the forecasts.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan must take bolder monetary easing steps to fight the heightening risk of deflation, board member Goushi Kataoka said on Thursday, warning of a darkening outlook for consumption and capital expenditure from the pandemic.
The BOJ must buy government bonds aggressively and make clear it is ready to cut interest rates further to ease the burden on households and firms, said Kataoka, among the most dovish in outlook of the policymakers in the nine-member board.
The central bank should also strengthen its commitment to combat deflation by setting specific conditions under which it will ramp up stimulus, Kataoka said.
""By taking action to show our determination we won't tolerate deflation, we can improve the credibility of our price target,"" he said in a speech to business leaders in Okinawa, southern Japan.
Kataoka has been a lone dissenter to the BOJ's decisions to maintain its interest rate targets, arguing that rate cuts are needed to pre-empt rising deflationary pressure.
The coronavirus pandemic has deepened Japan's recession and heightens challenges for the new prime minister, who is set to succeed incumbent Shinzo Abe later this month after Abe's abrupt decision to step down.
Kataoka said the hit to demand from COVID-19 was weighing on consumption and inflation, making it hard to expect price growth to accelerate toward the BOJ's 2% target.
""The job market is worsening due to the pandemic, which will drag on consumption,"" he said, adding that capital expenditure was also starting to fall.

""If the pandemic's impact is prolonged and hurts companies' medium- to long-term growth expectations, they may be forced to slash future demand projections and adjust capital spending plans,"" Kataoka said.

""I will miss Thomas as both a colleague and a friend,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement released by the central bank. ""He was a world-class economist, committed to public service and universally respected for his significant contributions to the theory and practice of monetary policy. His expertise, intellect, and good judgment were peerless.""
In a career that began with a research job at the Kansas City Fed and included research stints at the European Central Bank and Germany's Bundesbank, Laubach contributed to groundbreaking research on concepts like the natural rate of interest which neither encourages or discourages economic activity.
His method for estimating the natural rate, developed with current New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB), is now considered a benchmark often referred to in deliberations over monetary policy.
He was appointed to run the Fed's monetary affairs division in 2015 by then Chair Janet Yellen.
In that role he led the staff work behind the new strategy the Fed introduced last week to try to encourage higher employment - an effort that included a deep research agenda to guide debate among policymakers about how the economy had changed and how the central bank should respond to those changes.

The European Central Bank must withdraw emergency support when the economy has recovered from its pandemic shock, Governing Council member Jens Weidmann said in a speech that underscores his reputation as one of the institution’s most-hawkish policy makers.
It has always been important that the 1.35 trillion-euro ($1.6 trillion) emergency bond-buying program is “limited in duration and clearly linked to the crisis,” said Weidmann, the head of Germany’s Bundesbank.
His comments, a week before the ECB’s next policy meeting, feed into a debate over how quickly the central bank will ultimately need to pare back its extraordinary support. While he was cautious on the pace of the recovery so far, his tone differs from that of ECB chief economist Philip Lane who has stressed that the Governing Council will do more if needed.
“After the crisis, the emergency monetary-policy measures must be scaled back again,” Weidmann said during a virtual event on Wednesday evening. And “if the price outlook so requires, then monetary policy as a whole must be normalized,” he said, as risks and side effects “can increase over time.”
In Lane’s view, the ECB won’t be done with stimulus even when the economy has put the worst of its crisis behind. He argued that the next step after countering the immediate shock lies in fueling inflation.
In the wake of the pandemic, the ECB has made unprecedented bond purchases and loan offers to banks to stabilize financial markets and keep credit flowing to the region’s companies. While that’s prevented an even deeper slump, the economic hardship is far from over.
Weidmann warned that strong growth over the summer months in his native Germany “should not stir up false hopes.” Instead, “the recovery of our economy will drag on.”
Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel, who like Weidmann is from Germany, has said she sees no reason to change policy at this point given the economy is evolving in line with expectations.
“There could be surprises, both on the upside and the downside, which may mean that we have to reconsider our monetary-policy stance,” she said in an interview published Monday. “But at the moment, that’s not on the cards.”

749,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 04:40PM ET</span>","U.S. recovery, slow and uneven, is hampered by 'uncertainty': Fed survey","By Jonnelle Marte and Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - U.S. business activity and employment ticked up through late August, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday, but economic growth was generally sluggish as COVID-19 hotspots hampered reopening efforts that fueled an early-summer rebound. 
The Fed, in its ""Beige Book"" report, highlighted the uneven rebound underway in the U.S. economy, with some areas such as residential real estate surging with the help of low interest rates, but other sectors, such as commercial construction and agriculture, struggling to rebound. 
""Economic activity increased among most Districts, but gains were generally modest and activity remained well below levels prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the Fed said in the report, which is based on anecdotal information collected from business contacts across the country.  
Manufacturing rose in most districts and consumer spending continued to rise, helped by strong car sales and some gains in retail and tourism. 
The Fed's survey was conducted in its 12 districts from July through Aug. 24. 
The report showed economic progress was not spread equally across the nation, with the New York Fed district reporting economic activity had stalled, the Chicago Fed district reporting it had increased strongly, the Atlanta Fed district seeing mixed signals, and the San Francisco Fed saying activity expanded slightly.
That dovetails with what a variety of new high-frequency indicators have been indicating for weeks: After an initial early surge off the bottom in May and June, the U.S. recovery has entered a much lumpier stage as COVID-19 hotspots force regional retrenchments. 
Nationally, the number of new coronavirus infections is down to about 41,000 a day, from 77,000 in July, but some states are still struggling to contain the virus. Households and businesses also received less federal support in August, which marked the end of a $600 weekly supplement to unemployment benefits and the expiration of the Paycheck Protection Program, which offered forgivable loans to small businesses. 
CHILD CARE AND SCHOOL UNCERTAINTY
As the summer has progressed, businesses appear to have found it increasingly challenging to find workers and to meet the needs of existing employees facing child care shortages and widespread uncertainty about whether schools would reopen for in-person instruction.
For instance, a survey of firms in the Philadelphia Fed district in July found a shortage of child care was a larger impediment for hiring than were either fear of the virus or enhanced unemployment benefits. A similar survey conducted by the bank in May had found child care issues ranked third.
In the St. Louis district, an employment agency said ""it was 'not uncommon' for those it matched to jobs to quit within 48 hours,"" the report said.
Companies are taking different approaches to paying workers during the crisis. While some firms looked into rolling back hazard pay for jobs with high exposure to the coronavirus, others decided not to do so to boost staff morale and help recruitment. 
Overall, the report found wages were flat to slightly higher in most of the Fed districts, with greater pressure showing among lower-paying positions. 
Uncertainty weighed heavily, but firms in many regions saw at least some improvement coming, the report showed. In the Chicago Fed district, most firms forecast growth ahead but did not expect a recovery until at least the second half of 2021. 
In the Fed's St. Louis district, about half of contacts expected sales to return to pre-crisis levels, while a third thought it would take more than 12 months. In the Dallas district, expectations for future activity fell, even as uncertainty rose sharply.

Restaurants across several districts, including New York, Philadelphia, Richmond and Massachusetts, took advantage of warmer weather to expand outdoor dining options and some worried about how their businesses would fare as temperatures dropped. Outdoor dining accounted for more than one-third of restaurant sales in Massachusetts, where less than one-fifth of restaurants had outdoor dining options before the crisis, according to the report.

Even so, the shortfall is smaller than the non-partisan agency’s April projection of $3.7 trillion. In 2019, the gap was $984 billion. The updated budget estimate, issued Wednesday and which incorporates legislation enacted through Aug. 4, also showed the U.S. deficit will total $1.8 trillion in fiscal 2021.
The projected deficit for this year would equate to 16% of gross domestic product, up from 4.6% in 2019 and the largest since World War II. U.S. government outlays this fiscal year will jump to $6.6 trillion, the CBO estimated as lawmakers scrambled to put in place fiscal backstops to preserve jobs and companies after state-ordered shutdowns of non-essential businesses.
The resulting economic recession is also being reflected on the other side of the nation’s fiscal ledger. Revenue is projected to fall to $3.3 trillion this year from almost $3.5 trillion in 2019.
A rapidly expanding government deficit means more U.S. borrowing, and the CBO projects debt held by the public will increase to $33.5 trillion at the end of 2030, or 109% of GDP. It will exceed GDP starting in the next fiscal year.

“Economic activity increased among most districts, but gains were generally modest and activity remained well below levels prior to the Covid-19 pandemic,” the central bank said in its Beige Book survey released Wednesday. “Continued uncertainty and volatility related to the pandemic, and its negative effect on consumer and business activity, was a theme echoed across the country.”
Gains in the labor market were uneven, the report showed.
“Some districts also reported slowing job growth and increased hiring volatility, particularly in service industries, with rising instances of furloughed workers being laid off permanently as demand remained soft,” it said.
The report, compiled by the Minneapolis Fed, was based on anecdotal information collected from the central bank’s 12 regional branches through Aug. 24.
Businesses and households across the U.S. continue to struggle through the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, which has severely reduced demand, disrupted supply chains and pushed unemployment as high as 14.7% in April. The labor market has since shown a strong comeback, but joblessness was still above 10% in July.
ADP Research Institute data released earlier on Wednesday estimated private sector payrolls increased 428,000 in August, falling well short of the 1 million-plus expected by economists.

753,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>",Some U.S. cities turn against first planned small-scale nuclear plant,"By Timothy Gardner and Nichola Groom
(Reuters) - The first U.S. small-scale nuclear power project, grappling with cost overruns and delays, faces another challenge: the defection of cities that had committed to buying its power. The more than 30 members of the public power consortium Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) have until Sept. 30 to decide whether to stick with the project and devote more funds to NuScale Power LLC's first-of-a-kind reactor.
But two cities, Logan and Lehi, Utah have walked away from the project, and a third is now considering dropping its support because of risks and a lack of backers, according to officials.
Allen Johnson, the power department director for Bountiful, Utah, said chances are greater than 50-50 it will withdraw.
“You’ve got to have enough people to support it and some of the players I thought would be interested are not,” he said.
The defections are bad news for U.S. efforts to develop modular nuclear energy, which is regarded by some as a critical carbon-free technology that power grids will need to supplement intermittent sources like wind and solar.
Combined, cities have so far committed to buying just under 200 megawatts of the plant’s planned 720 megawatts of power.
The U.S. Department of Energy has pumped more the $280 million into the project since 2013, and is expected to commit another $1.4 billion over the next nine years. The department did not respond to requests for comment.
UAMPS spokesman LaVarr Webb said ""the project is very much alive"" noting that just two of 35 cities have officially left.
The consortium earlier this year pushed back the project's commercial operation date to 2030 from 2026, Webb said, to provide more time for public input and opportunities for cities to reconsider their participation at various phases.
CITIES RETHINK COSTS
NuScale, based in Portland, Oregon, is majority owned by construction and engineering firm  Fluor Corp  (NYSE:FLR).
The project would include 12 60-megawatt modules at the Energy Department’s Idaho National Laboratory (NYSE:LH).
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission last week approved NuScale's design, the first such green light for a modular reactor.
Small modular reactors are meant to be cheaper and quicker to build than traditional reactors because they can be manufactured in factories. But critics say economies of scale are lost with the smaller plants.
The NuScale project's projected cost of $6.1 billion has risen from $3.6 billion in 2017, Mark Montgomery, head of the municipal utility in Logan told officials there last month ahead of their vote to abandon the project.
Lehi withdrew from the project due to a lack of interest from other entities and increased costs, according to the Aug. 25 resolution approved by its city council.
""These cities should not be acting as venture capital investors,"" said Rusty Cannon, vice president of the Utah Taxpayers Association, which has been pushing cities to leave.
Previous cost estimates did not account for financing and decommissioning, as well as higher labor, construction and materials costs over ten years, UAMPS spokesman Webb said, explaining the change.
NuScale said the project delay had been requested by UAMPS. It did not comment specifically on the city defections.
A Wednesday report written by M.V. Ramana a professor of disarmament and human security at the University of British Columbia said Fluor had cut its own investment in the project and excluded NuScale expenses from its financial forecasts because it was expecting additional funding from third party investors.
Financial analyst Jamie Cook of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said last year that Fluor could improve earnings by reducing underperforming assets, including NuScale.
In a statement to Reuters, Fluor said it had seen new investor interest since the NRC's design approval and added that the investment community ""has struggled with"" its NuScale relationship because it is unusual for a construction and engineering firm to invest in research and development.

""When you're making policy, you have to look ahead but you also have to make sure you're not missing some of the risks on either side,"" Mester said during a question and answer session of a webinar organized by the NABE Foundation.

The U.S. central bank last week announced a sweeping overhaul of its monetary policy strategy, adapting it in an environment where interest rates are expected to stay low. The shift puts more focus on shortfalls in employment and allows for slightly higher inflation.
""The new statement language clarifies that in the absence of inflationary pressures or risks to financial stability, strong employment is not a concern and monetary policy will not react to it,"" Mester said in remarks prepared for a webinar.
The strategy makes it clear that since inflation has been running below the central bank's 2% target, Fed officials will now ""likely set policy with the intention to move inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time,"" Mester said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden and another interest-rate setter, Gertjan Vlieghe, warned of risks that Britain's economy could suffer more damage from the coronavirus crisis than spelt out by the central bank last month.
Ramsden told lawmakers on Wednesday that the BoE had estimated the level of Britain's economic output would permanently be about 1.5 percentage points lower than it would have been without the pandemic. 
""For me all the risks are really that that number will be greater than 1.5%,"" Ramsden said.
He reiterated that the BoE had ""headroom to do materially more QE if we need to"", referring to a possible fresh expansion of the central bank's bond-buying programme which already stands at 745 billion pounds ($991.37 billion).
Vlieghe said there was ""a material risk"" that it could take several years for Britain's economy to return to full capacity after its coronavirus shock.
The BoE said in August it expected Britain's economy to recover its pre-COVID-19 size by the end of next year.
Britain's economy shrank by more than 20% in the April-June period, worse than any other big industrialised nation. That was partly because the country locked down later than many of its European peers.
Vlieghe said some sectors might not recover their pre-pandemic size, leading to a reorientation of the economy.
""Based on these considerations, there is a material risk in my view that it could take several years for the economy to return to full capacity and inflation to return sustainably to target, even with monetary policy at its current settings,"" he said in an annual report to parliament.
Governor Andrew Bailey said inflation might not turn negative as forecast by the BoE last month, citing evidence that many businesses had not passed a value-added tax cut on to customers as much as had been expected.
""So that will tend to cause short-run inflation to be higher than we thought it would be, and it probably won't now go negative.""
Asked for his views on the recovery in the economy after its lockdown, Bailey said the bounce back in consumption had been very fast while investment had been weak.
He also said a geographic breakdown of spending data showed that London had seen the weakest revival of credit card spending since the lockdown.
The capital has been particularly hard hit by the reluctance of many workers and their employers to get back to their usual places of work. Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week repeated his calls for people to return to their workplaces.

The U.S. central bank announced a new strategy last week to target an average rate of inflation over time. The approach makes it clear that temporarily higher inflation is ""desirable"" to reach the average inflation target, and it clarifies that the Fed is focused on shortfalls in employment, Williams said in remarks prepared for the Bretton Woods Committee Webinar.

SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A selloff in the Thai baht, underperforming stocks and pressure on the bond market reflect growing concern from global investors over political instability and the growth outlook in Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy, analysts and fund managers say.
Thailand suffered its deepest economic contraction in two decades last quarter and a long haul to recovery looms as the COVID-19 pandemic has hammered its mainstay tourism industry.
At the same time, the government is facing a student protest movement which is gathering momentum and disruption to its policy agenda by the surprise resignation of Finance Minister Predee Daochai on Tuesday, after less than a month in the job. 
""I think no other country has these two or three problems going on at the same time, as if the COVID-19 situation isn't bad enough,"" said OCBC Bank economist Howie Lee.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has said Predee's exit, for health reasons, would not affect economic plans, but he did not outline a timetable for appointing a new minister.
The baht  fell and has dropped about 0.6% on the dollar since Tuesday on the news, its steepest two-day slide in about two weeks. It now sits where it traded in June despite a slide in the greenback over the past few months. [EMRG/FRX]
Thailand's benchmark stock index (SETI) is down 17% for the year, having suffered foreign outflows in every month till August - lagging a 5% gain in Asian markets (MIAPJ0000PUS). 
""The only foreigners left in Thai equities really are the passive investors, the ETFs and the funds which track the index. The active managers are gone,"" said Jeep Chatikavanij, founder of the Ton Poh Fund which manages $150 million.
A global selloff in longer-dated government bonds has also hit Thailand slightly harder than elsewhere, as investors struggle to digest the big debt sales that are paying for governments' spending.
Widening corporate credit spreads, as investors demand a greater premium for lending to Thai firms, also shows creeping default risk, said BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY)' head of ASEAN Economics, Arup Raha.

KABUL (Reuters) - An Afghan company has unveiled a range of small trucks and passenger vans which it hopes will appeal to a local market still dominated by second-hand Japanese models imported via Dubai.
The firm, Amin Noor, presented the vehicles at a ceremony in the capital Kabul, a reminder that in a country beset by militant violence and political instability there are companies working hard to tap a small but growing middle class.
Beyond the security challenges, firms also face the added hurdle of power cuts that are a regular occurrence across Afghanistan.
""The overall cost is much cheaper than those products we import to Afghanistan,"" Economy Minister Mustafa Mastoor told Reuters at the ceremony, where white vans, trucks and cars were decorated in red ribbon.
Some were electric and powered by rechargeable batteries, others by diesel.
""We are confident that the Afghan market will welcome these type of products, not only from Amin Noor company but all other investors if they come and invest in quality products.""
There are 11 different models in total, priced between $1,200 and $2,500. Amin Noor has produced 200 vehicles to date.
For company manager Ahmad Zia Ahmadyar, the next phase for Amin Noor - which produces vehicles at its factory in Balkh province in the north of Afghanistan - was to reduce the number of parts that needed importing.
""After three years, we were able to produce up to 80% of the parts of these vehicles ourselves,"" he said.
""Our goal is to produce the parts of these vehicles that we still import from abroad, such as the engine, tires, and window glass ... in the next five or 10 years.""

BUENOS AIRES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Argentina has gained breathing room after restructuring almost the entirety of $65 billion in foreign bonds, though it now faces a huge challenge to revive growth and repair government finances before the oxygen runs out.
The South American grains producer said on Monday it had restructured 99% of eligible bonds in its debt deal after almost all bondholders got on board, a major win for Argentina, which is mired in recession and default.
The country has also converted $8 billion in local dollar debt through voluntary swaps and is near the finish line to restructure over $40 billion in local-law dollar borrowings. 
""Taken together, these deals will give the government some much-need respite as it tackles the devastating fallout from the coronavirus crisis,"" Nikhil Sanghani at Capital Economics said in a note after the deal.
He added, however, that Argentina's dollar debt remained high and the risk of another default would rise over time, especially with weak reserves, downward pressure on the peso and stubborn inflation.
""The bottom line is that Argentina's public debt is no longer a near-term concern. But it is likely to rear its ugly head within a few years,"" Sanghani said.
First on the agenda will be the local-law dollar debt swap, sorting out provincial debt restructurings and turning attention to negotiating a new deal with the International Monetary Fund to replace a failed $57 billion facility from 2018.
The government is also set this month to lay out its budget for 2021, which will give some idea of its plan to revive an economy likely to contract around 12.5% this year, the third straight year of recession.
""It is up to Argentina, to the current administration to come up with a program that reignites growth for their country, and that's going to be challenging,"" said Eric Baurmeister, a senior portfolio manager at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management and head of its emerging markets debt team.
SHUT OUT OF MARKETS
Without a clear economic program, Baurmeister said, yields on the country's new sovereign bonds, set to be issued on Sept. 4, will be elevated, given the perception of risk.
""The yields will be high, they'll be effectively shut out of the external markets for a very long period of time,"" he added.
Investors are looking at the new bonds' exit yield when they start trading, which people said would be between 10%-12%.
Argentine bonds, which crashed last year, have climbed over recent days in thin trading, with most of those involved in the restructuring at between 40-50 cents on the dollar. The offer had an average valuation of 54.8 cents at a 10% exit yield.
The deal also opens the door for Argentina to escape from its ninth sovereign default after it missed a bond payment in May, though ratings agencies said they were watching to see what happened with the local restructuring.
""We're waiting on the results of both debt exchanges, external and local, to assess if Argentina has cured its default and what its exit rating will be,"" said Todd Martinez, director of Latin America sovereigns at Fitch Ratings.
Lisa Schineller from S&P said the agency could move on the question of default and ratings once the new bonds were issued and the local law debt resolved.
""Upon settlement, we could raise the issuer's credit ratings and assign new credit ratings to bonds,"" she said, adding that those tended to be B- or CCC category.

""We would have to look at the new profile, the new policy stance. The perception that there were greater risks would keep it more in a CCC category,"" she added.

LONDON(Reuters) - Detailed analysis is needed before the European Union can decide on long-term access for the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) to clear euro denominated derivatives for customers in the bloc, a European Central Bank official said on Wednesday.
The LSE dominates euro derivatives clearing and EU policymakers have called for the activity to be relocated to the bloc given that Britain will no longer have to comply with EU rules after Dec. 31 when a post-Brexit transition period ends.
The EU's executive, the European Commission, has said it will grant Britain ""time limited"" clearing access from January to allow the bloc to build up its own euro clearing capacity and avoid disrupting markets.
Klaus Loeber, a senior supervisor at the ECB, was being quizzed by members of the European Parliament on Wednesday about his appointment as chair of a new EU clearing committee that will advise the European Commission and directly supervise foreign clearing houses serving the bloc.
There was a need to look closely at longer term implications by taking into account the ability of EU firms to access global markets without undue costs and the role of sovereignty in EU markets, Loeber said.
""This requires analysis, very concretely of specific products, services, to see where there is a significant interest on the side of the EU to have a more direct influence.""
The LSE has already moved clearing of euro repurchase agreement or repo contracts from London to its Paris subsidiary, but the clearing of over 90% of euro interest rate swaps remains in London.
The EU has found itself in the ""slightly unusual position"" of having a major financial centre close by that is outside the euro zone and, from January, outside the direct influence of EU law, Loeber said.

""What is key for me is that there is clear analysis for the stability implications, both in regards to relocation and non-relocation, and to balance this with a clear strategy and a clearly communicated strategy,"" Loeber said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets face possibly significant corrections after rebounding beyond their coronavirus-hit economic fundamentals, the European Union's securities watchdog said on Wednesday.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said there has been a ""potential decoupling"" of financial market gains and an economy hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, raising questions about the sustainability of the current market rebound.
ESMA said its latest ""trends, risks and vulnerabilities"" report continued to see very high risks in markets.
Stock markets surged by 40% in the euro area since a trough in mid-March when economies went into lockdown to fight the pandemic and economies went into recession. The IMF expects a drop of more than 10% in euro zone GDP this year, with only a mild recovery in 2021.
There is a ""prolonged period of risk to institutional and retail investors of further - possibly significant - market corrections"", the EU watchdog said.
""The impact on EU corporates and their credit quality, and on credit institutions, are of particular concern.""
ESMA's report also looked at whether new EU rules that require brokers to itemise charges for research on stock picks and executing trades, known as unbundling, will improve transparency for clients.
Critics have said it would lead to a dearth of research on smaller, less high profile stocks, but ESMA said in its report on Wednesday that its analysis ""does not find material evidence of harmful effects from the unbundling rules"".

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan (BOJ) may need to pay more attention to job and household income in guiding monetary policy, deputy governor Masazumi Wakatabe said, as the coronavirus pandemic pushes the economy deeper into recession.
In an online briefing on Wednesday, Wakatabe said there were many lessons to learn from the U.S. Federal Reserve's new policy strategy that focuses more on creating jobs and boosting household income.
""Personally, I feel there is room to consider the idea, voiced by some people, that monetary policy should focus more on job and income conditions,"" he said.
""The BOJ doesn't need to directly set them as targets. But it can take job and income conditions more into account in debating policy.""
The BOJ is mandated by law to achieve price and financial system stability, but does not have a target on jobs growth.
A few academics have called on the BOJ to target jobs or nominal gross domestic product (GDP) to strengthen its commitment to maintain ultra-easy policy longer.
Wakatabe said overseas examples will be ""very useful"" for the BOJ in enhancing its policy framework as many nations face the same damaging effect on jobs and consumption from COVID-19.
He declined to comment on Japan's political situation but said the BOJ's current monetary policy was ""most appropriate"" for now, regardless of who becomes the new prime minister.
Japan is facing a leadership race this month after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's decision to step down. Yoshihide Suga, the government's top spokesman, is emerging as the front-runner to succeed Abe, heightening expectations that many of the premier's stimulus policies will be maintained.
Wakatabe said the BOJ must focus on avoiding deflation, and warned that temporary external shocks, such as the current pandemic, could lead to persistent stagnation.
""In order to address both upside and downside risks to prices, the BOJ must continue to strongly commit itself to achieving its (2%) price target,"" he said.

Analysts expect Japan's core consumer prices, which were flat in July from a year earlier, to slide in coming months due to soft demand, reviving fears of a return to deflation.

Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday showed the country's A$2 trillion ($1.47 trillion) economy shrank 7% in the three months to end-June from a 0.3% decline in the March quarter.
The country joins the United States, Japan, UK and Germany in technical recession, defined as two straight quarters of decline, in Australia's first such downturn since 1991.
""This crisis is like no other,"" Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra.
""Today's national accounts confirm the devastating impact on the Australian economy from COVID-19. Our record run of 28 consecutive years of economic growth has now officially come to an end.""
In a clear signal that the fiscal stimulus will keep flowing Frydenberg added, ""our commitment to the Australian people is that we have your back. We will be with you through this crisis and...all the way out of this crisis.""
The June quarter decline was also the largest in quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) since records began in 1959.
The contraction, which was deeper than median forecasts of 5.9%, comes as Australia's second most-populous state of Victoria remains in a lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus while international borders are shut too.
Frydenberg said the Victoria's lockdowns would weigh ""heavily"" on September quarter GDP.
More than a million people have lost their jobs since March when Australia shut down entire sectors of the economy, hitting private sector demand and investments.
The government did step up with more than A$300 billion of stimulus, though Wednesday's gloomy data underlines the need for more stimulus as the recovery is expected to be uneven and bumpy.
On an annual basis, GDP declined by 6.3%.
""Looking ahead, it is clear that the path back from the COVID-19 recession will be protracted,"" said Sarah Hunter, chief economist for BIS Oxford Economics.
""Growth in the September quarter will be weighed down by the lockdown in Victoria, and beyond this continued health concerns, ongoing restrictions and the dialling back of income support will all weigh on the economy,"" Hunter added.
""We expect it to take until early 2022 for activity to return to pre-pandemic levels.""
On its part, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) slashed interest rates to a record 0.25% in an emergency meeting in March and on Tuesday expanded its cheap funding facility for the country's lenders to keep low-cost credit flowing in the economy.

It has promised to provide additional support if needed.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The growing likelihood that Yoshihide Suga will succeed Shinzo Abe as Japan's new premier may be a mixed blessing for the country's central bank.
As Abe's key lieutenant and the government's top spokesman, Suga is a safe pair of hands and has a thorough knowledge of the Bank of Japan's policy framework, but he also knows how to pressure the bank into action.
With Suga solidifying support within the country's ruling party ahead of a leadership election later this month, Tokyo stocks have rallied on expectations Abe's pro-growth policies will be maintained.
The central bank, locked in a battle to cushion the blow from the coronavirus pandemic, sees little need for policy change regardless of who becomes next prime minister, sources familiar with its thinking say.
Suga, in particular, could maintain the status quo if he takes the helm, given the key role he played in pushing through ""Abenomics"", which sought to spur growth with bold monetary easing, fiscal spending and structural reforms.
""He has a deep understanding of the BOJ's policies, so the likelihood of policy continuity will heighten,"" one of the sources said.
""A Suga administration would maintain most of Abe's policies,"" including its stance on monetary policy, said a second source.
For BOJ policymakers, Suga is a familiar face who is unlikely to bully the central bank with explicit demands for radical measures, the sources say.
However, armed with a strong grip on Tokyo's bureaucracy and a deep knowledge of Abe's economic policies, Suga may prove to be a tough negotiator for the BOJ if conditions worsen, as it struggles to battle economic headwinds with a dwindling toolkit.
""The BOJ comes under little pressure when markets are calm. That changes when markets turn volatile,"" said a third source.
Sharing Abe's sensitivity to financial market upheavals, especially sharp rises in the yen, Suga in 2016 created a framework for joint BOJ, finance ministry and banking regulator meetings at times of volatility, helping Tokyo signal to investors its alarm over market moves.
People with direct knowledge of the matter say Suga was among those who urged the BOJ to act when an unwelcome spike in the yen hit Japan's export-oriented economy in early 2016. The central bank adopted negative interest rates in January of that year.
A government focus on keeping sharp yen rises in check will also be sustained under the new administration if Finance Minister Taro Aso - who as a former premier holds bitter memories of battling a yen spike that crushed the economy - retains his post, said John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management.
""There is little reason to expect Suga would disagree with such (aversion to sharp yen rises), and perhaps might even push for more yen-weakening policies,"" he said.
'HAND IN HAND'
Abe's administration has praised the BOJ for moving in lockstep with the government by easing monetary policy twice so far this year to cushion the pandemic's blow on the economy.
Many BOJ officials feel they have done enough for now given the rising cost and diminishing returns of further easing, and are cautious of ramping up stimulus too hastily, particularly by cutting already ultra-low interest rates, the sources say.
But Suga isn't buying arguments against rate cuts, such as the negative effects of low rates on bank profits.
In an interview with Reuters last week, he countered the view that prolonged ultra-low rates were to blame for the plight of regional banks, calling instead for more consolidation among the lenders to streamline operations.
He also stressed the need for the BOJ to work hand in hand with the government, signaling his hope that the central bank will continue to assist government efforts to support growth.
""We're always acting closely and pre-emptively with the BOJ,"" Suga said, when asked whether the BOJ should ease further if the government were to compile another stimulus package.

""It's very important that the two sides act together.""

""Sadly, this phone call made clear that Democrats and the White House continue to have serious differences understanding the gravity of the situation that America's working families are facing,"" Pelosi said in a statement.
No negotiations on another round of coronavirus aid have taken place since early August, when talks collapsed as congressional Democrats and the Republican Trump administration could not bridge a gap of more than $1 trillion between their proposed relief packages for small businesses, state and local governments, school districts and healthcare providers.
""In our conversation, I reiterated the hope that Republicans will come to the table and work with Democrats to save the lives and livelihoods of the American people,"" Pelosi said.
In mid-May, House Democrats approved a fifth coronavirus-response bill this year totaling more than $3 trillion. Months later, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell responded with a $1 trillion bill that the Senate has not voted upon.
Mnuchin said on Monday he hoped McConnell would unveil a new bill next week. Some Republicans oppose new aid out of concern over a massive and growing budget deficit predicted to approach $4 trillion this year.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said on Friday that Trump was willing to sign a $1.3 trillion coronavirus relief bill, up from an initial proposal of $1 trillion.

Pelosi had reduced Democrats' initial $3 trillion demand to $2.2 trillion but was insisting on the need for new funds for state and local governments, schools and coronavirus testing and tracing of infections.

The world’s largest consumer of agricultural products suspended imports from CBH Grain Pty in Western Australia because harmful weeds were found in the cargoes, according to a statement from Chinese customs. Australia has been notified of the decision, it said.
The move is the latest in a flurry of Chinese actions against Australian exports, coming just a day after China announced an anti-subsidy investigation into the country’s wines, which itself was less than two weeks after it said it began an anti-dumping probe into the same product.
Ties between the trading partners have become increasingly frayed. In addition to banning Huawei Technologies Co. from participating in Australia’s 5G network, Australia’s push for an independent inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak has sparked a Chinese backlash.
China halted some beef imports earlier this year, with a fifth meatworks banned from shipping product there just last week.
CBH, Australia’s largest barley exporter, will work with the government to challenge the suspension and has not found any evidence to support the claims, a spokesperson said.
“CBH confirms that all grain shipments to China have met all government phytosanitary export requirements and is therefore very disappointed to hear of the suspension.”
Australian Finance Minister Mathias Cormann told reporters Wednesday that CBH had a reputation for providing “high quality grain products.”
Once the government knows more details of the ban, it would work with the company to make the appropriate representations to China, Cormann said. The government respects the fact that China has quarantine inspection arrangements, he added.
Australia’s barley shipments to the Asian nation have already been slashed after China imposed tariffs of more than 80% on imports of the grain earlier this year following anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations. Australian growers have reduced barley planting in favor of wheat following the tariffs.
China has been buying hefty amounts of U.S. corn, partly as a way to replace the Australian barley supplies. Now, barley from Australia is among the cheapest in the world after the tariffs were imposed.
The Chinese ambassador to Canberra said in April that Chinese consumers might choose to boycott the nation’s exports because of strained relations.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A strike by Chile truckers is hitting exports of salmon, fruit, meat and wine from the South American food producer to the United States, Europe and Asia, trade groups told Reuters on Tuesday.
The week-long standoff has created port backlogs, raising the risk of food price spikes and fuel shortages in some regions. A port official said almost no export shipments were leaving as scheduled.
“There is practically no Chilean cargo that can leave or with the loads that should be leaving,"" said Carlos Mondaca, a spokesman for San Antonio port, one of the country's two largest. 
Chile's fruit exporters association (ASOEX) said it had six ships due to set sail this week for the United States, Europe and Hong Kong with kiwi, apples, pears and citrus but it was struggling to get the produce to the port. 
Industry group Salmon Chile said it was struggling to obtain products needed for its processing plants and send fresh fish to the capital Santiago. The blockades could soon start to affect exports from sea and airports, President Arturo Clement told trade publication Salmon Expert.
The operators of San Antonio port also said 290,000 tonnes of grains were sitting in eight ships waiting to be unloaded onto trucks but none were available.
The strike began last Thursday when the Confederation of Chilean Cargo Transport (CNTC), one of three truckers' confederations mobilized over a spike in attacks on truckers in south-central Araucania region and the slow track of security reforms through Congress.
The region has long been convulsed by a simmering conflict between the indigenous Mapuche and the Chilean state.
On Monday, talks between the truckers and the government broke down, with government threatening to invoke a state security law to penalise those blocking roads.
Early on Tuesday morning, a 55-year-old trucker taking part in the strike was run over and killed by a lorry carrying medication in the southern Maule region, according to police.
A video circulated on social media apparently showing striking truck drivers enjoying a nighttime party and dancing with two women wearing lingerie on a highway hard shoulder also sparked further fury among Chileans divided over whether the strike methods are justified.
Jaime Bellolio, a government spokesman, on Tuesday said the truckers must stand down rather than threatening critical supply chains as the country struggles to restart its economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

Chile’s largest salmon markets are the United States, Japan and Brazil. The $16 billion Chilean fruit industry is one of the southern hemisphere's largest.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador defended his handling of the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic on Tuesday, arguing in a major speech that the economy has fared better than some of its peers.
The pandemic lockdown threw Mexico's economy, Latin America's second largest, into the deepest slump since the Great Depression, shrinking 17% in the second quarter.
""The economy's contraction, despite the global disaster, was 10.4% during the first half of the year. But despite the collapse the damage was smaller than in Italy, Spain, France and the United Kingdom,"" Lopez Obrador said in his state of the union address from the ornate national palace.
Lopez Obrador has resisted pressure to borrow to support the economy or bail out companies on the brink of collapse, while picking fights with some businesses.
""We have faced the pandemic and we are going to get out of the economic crisis without taking on additional external debt and without allocating public money to immoral bailouts,"" he said.
In contrast, Brazil's economy contracted 9.7% in the second quarter as its government launched a spending program to cushion the pandemic's impact.
Lopez Obrador has forecast that Mexico's economy will follow a V-shaped trajectory, meaning a sharp slump followed by an equally sharp recovery.
Mexico's central bank has warned the economy could contract by almost 13% this year.
Some Mexicans feel let down by the government. In front of the National Palace in the capital various labor groups protested the government's lack of support for workers during the pandemic.
Flora Aco, an activist from the feminist group Bread and Roses, said the government should have offered a ""quarantine salary"" to millions who work in Mexico's informal economy and were put out of work by widespread lockdowns.

""They were left in complete instability,"" said Aco, one of several hundred protesters by the National Palace.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday issued a joint $2.5 million award to two external analysts who flagged financial reporting abuses by Orthofix (NASDAQ:OFIX) Medical Inc, the agency and the lawyers for the analysts said in separate statements.
The case is unusual because company whistleblowers are typically more likely to be insiders and legal questions have been raised in the past as to whether outsiders using public information can qualify for an award under the SEC's landmark whistleblower program introduced following the 2007-09 financial crisis. 
""Detailed analysis by outsiders of companies can have a significant impact on the enforcement of the federal securities laws,"" Chief of the Office of the Whistleblower Jane Norberg said in a statement.
In 2017, the Texas-based medical device maker, formerly known as Orthofix International NV, paid $8.25 million to settle https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2017-18.html SEC accounting fraud charges. Between 2011 and 2013, the company materially inflated its earnings by distributing more products than its customers needed, known as ""channel stuffing,"" among other inappropriate accounting practices, the SEC said in 2017.
On Tuesday, the agency said it had issued the bounty but declined to name the company or individuals concerned. 
Jordan Thomas, an attorney for the whistleblowers with law firm Labaton Sucharow, said the SEC reward resulted from the Orthofix International 2017 case.
In 2012, Orthofix International first caught the attention of the analysts, who declined to be identified. They regularly swapped notes on company numbers they thought looked odd and subsequently tipped off the regulator about irregularities in Orthofix International's filings, Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/article/sec-fraud-whistleblowers/rpt-not-an-inside-job-how-two-analysts-became-sec-whistleblowers-idUSL1N1HW19B in 2017.

781,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>","U.S. economy needs more Fed stimulus 'in coming months,' Brainard says","By Howard Schneider and Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve ""in coming months"" will need to roll out new efforts to help the economy overcome the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and live up to the U.S. central bank's new promise of stronger job growth and higher inflation, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said on Tuesday.
""With the recovery likely to face COVID-19-related headwinds for some time, in coming months, it will be important for monetary policy to pivot from stabilization to accommodation,"" Brainard said, and do what's appropriate to hit the new goals of ""maximum employment and average inflation of 2% over time.""
That decision ""will be guided"" by the new strategy which trades risks of higher inflation with efforts to promote further job growth, she said during a webcast discussion organized by the Brookings Institution.
Brainard, among the architects of the new long-term strategy the central bank adopted last week, is the first Fed official to tie that new approach directly to the need for further monetary stimulus, likely in the form of more aggressive bond-buying or more ambitious promises about returning the country to low unemployment.
The change in strategy is being billed by Fed officials as a ""milestone"" shift that puts its emphasis squarely on encouraging more employment and, in the process, helping low-income and minority communities benefit more from periods of growth.
The Fed has been pushed in recent years to take closer account of persistent economic disparities between Blacks and whites for example. In its prior approach, unemployment rates below a certain level were seen as raising the risk of inflation and requiring interest rate hikes that slowed growth just as minority communities were beginning to benefit.
With some Democratic officials calling for a more extensive focus by the U.S. central bank on things like the Black unemployment rate, Brainard said she felt the new framework is responsive to those concerns about inequality.
The new approach ""will enable the labor market to heal for a much more sustained period ... That is the single most important factor to bring some of these structurally challenged groups back into the labor force,"" she said.
But some analysts have argued the Fed's new framework is incomplete without more details on what it intends to do to implement it, and during a panel discussion on Tuesday former Fed chiefs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen agreed.
""I need to see some action,"" Bernanke said, grading the new framework as ""incomplete"" and ""aspirational.""
'UNWARRANTED LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY'
In recent days, as the new framework was announced, Fed officials largely steered clear of promising further action, but Brainard appeared to agree that the central bank now needs to follow through. 
With the new framework now set, it ""would be natural to turn back"" at coming meetings to how ""core tools"" like bond-buying and forward guidance should change as a result, she added.
The timetable Brainard outlined puts any Fed decision on further economic stimulus beyond the Nov. 3 presidential election.[nL1N2FX1AP]
Brainard also detailed how she sees the new framework benefiting workers.
Prior decisions to raise interest rates when unemployment fell, even as inflation remained low, represented ""an unwarranted loss of opportunity for many Americans,"" she said.
That included the initially slow pace of rate increases begun under the Yellen-led Fed in 2015. Though the glacial pace of those hikes, Brainard noted, allowed Black and Hispanic unemployment to continue falling and drew millions into the labor force, it is likely ""the gains would have been greater,"" under the new approach. 
Yellen, who guided the Fed to that initial ""liftoff"" of interest rates, said those increases in borrowing costs responded to forecasts at the time that joblessness was moving beyond its sustainable ""natural"" rate - a concept itself that has been done away with in the new framework in favor of a more open-ended view of maximum employment.

If that new approach had been in place in 2015, ""it would have made a small difference. I don’t think it would have made a huge difference,"" Yellen said.
 
"
782,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 03:27PM ET</span>",Ex-Fed Chief Yellen Defends Rate Increases Under Her Watch,"(Bloomberg) -- Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen defended the rate increases executed during her term as head of the U.S. central bank, saying they were not enough to derail the expansion then underway.
“We saw ourselves as having our foot firmly on the gas pedal,” and raising rates represented easing up a bit, Yellen said during an online panel Tuesday hosted by the Brookings Institution. “It was by no means the case that we slammed on the brakes.”
The Fed began raising interest rates off zero in December 2015 when unemployment stood at 5.1% and year-on-year inflation was just 0.3%. When she left office in 2018, the federal funds rate sat in a range of 1.25% to 1.5%.
The Fed last week unveiled a new monetary policy strategy that will take a more relaxed approach toward inflation, which has long run below their 2% target, and allow unemployment to run lower than they previously tolerated.
Shortly before the panel, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said the new framework, had it been in place in 2015 and subsequent years, would have altered the institution’s policy.
The new strategy “would have changed deliberations earlier had all of these factors been well understood,” Brainard said.
Yellen pushed back against that conclusion. “It would have made a small difference,” she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday said his administration would help U.S. airlines facing sharp downturns in passenger traffic as a result of the novel coronavirus pandemic, but gave no details.
""We'll be helping the airlines. You have to help the airlines,"" Trump told reporters before departing on a visit to Kenosha, Wisconsin. ""Airlines are a tough business in good times.""
Airline shares jumped briefly on Trump's comments but later gave up the gains and were trading in negative territory. American Airlines (O:AAL) was down 0.2% around mid-afternoon, while United Airlines (O:UAL) was down nearly 1%.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows last week said Trump was weighing executive action to avoid massive layoffs at airlines if Congress fails to agree on a fresh economic stimulus package to counter the fallout from the pandemic.
Helping the airline industry is a ""significant concern"" for the Trump administration given its strategic importance for national security and supply chains, in addition to the large number of jobs at stake, a senior administration official said.
The official said there was significant bipartisan support in Congress for measures to help airlines and ensure they survived the prolonged collapse in demand.
""We're ready to negotiate,"" the official said.
U.S. passenger airlines are still collectively losing more than $5 billion a month as 30% of planes remain parked. Passenger travel demand is down about 70% and, on average, planes that are flying are half-full.
Last week, American Airlines said its workforce would shrink by 40,000, including 19,000 involuntary cuts, in October unless the government extends aid for airline employee payrolls.
United said on Thursday it will need to cut 2,850 pilot jobs between Oct. 1 and Nov. 30 if the government does not extend assistance.
Airlines received $25 billion in U.S. government stimulus funds in March meant to cover payrolls and protect jobs through September. Congress also approved another $25 billion in loans for airlines.
As bailout money runs out without a travel recovery in sight, airlines and unions have lobbied Washington for another $25 billion. However, talks have stalled as Congress has struggled to reach agreement on a broader coronavirus assistance package.

American said last month it would suspend flights to 15 small U.S. cities in October without more federal aid.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's economy shrank in the second quarter by the most on record as anti-coronavirus lockdown measures slammed activity in almost every sector, dragging Latin America's largest economy back to the size it was in 2009.
The pandemic triggered a 9.7% fall in gross domestic product from the prior quarter, government statistics agency IBGE said on Tuesday, and an 11.4% decline compared with the same period last year.
The magnitude of the slump in activity across the economy in the second quarter was huge: industry fell 12.3%, services 9.7%, fixed investment 15.4%, household consumption 12.5% and government spending 8.8%.
Household consumption, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity in Brazil, was a particularly heavy drag, IBGE said.
Only agriculture expanded in the quarter, by 0.4%.
Carlos Kawall, director at ASA Bank and a former treasury secretary, said Brazil's economy is unlikely to grow back to where it was last year until 2023.
""It's a horrible period for the economy. From the standpoint of the economy, social implications, and unemployment, it has been a disaster,"" he said, adding that he is revising down his 2021 growth forecast to 2.1% from 2.7% due to uncertainty about the labor market and consumption outlook.
The economy ministry was more upbeat, noting that many of Brazil's emerging market peers posted larger GDP contractions in the second quarter and that the outlook for this year has been brightening in recent weeks.
""High frequency indicators show that activity continues to recover. However, for the rebound to be consistent, it is important to continue the structural reform and fiscal consolidation agenda,"" it said in a statement.
The government's current forecast is for a 4.7% contraction in GDP this year, which would still be the largest annual fall since records began in 1900. The average forecast in a weekly central bank survey of economists is for a 5.3% decline.
The downturn in the April-June period was steeper than economists had expected. The median estimates in a Reuters poll of economists were for a 9.4% fall on the quarter and an annual decline of 10.7%.
The value of Brazil's GDP at current prices was 1.65 trillion reais ($306 billion) in the second quarter, IBGE said.
IBGE also revised the January-March figures to a 2.5% fall in GDP from the initial estimate of a 1.5% decline.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German lawmakers launched a parliamentary enquiry into the collapse of payments firm Wirecard (DE:WDIG) on Tuesday, a probe that will force the government to reveal more about a failure to avert the country's biggest post-war corporate fraud.
The implosion of what was seen as a German success story once worth $28 billion has embarrassed the government, which prides itself on a reputation for rectitude and reliability, amid criticism that German authorities ignored many red flags.
""This was a fake company,"" said Fabio de Masi, a German lawmaker who played a key role in launching the enquiry that empowers parliamentarians to interrogate officials and demand information. ""We are not getting the answers we need.""
Wirecard is now being dismantled, after its disclosure of a 1.9 billion euro hole in its accounts earlier this year triggered its insolvency. 
Former CEO Markus Braun and other executives have been held on suspicion of running a criminal racket that defrauded creditors of 3.2 billion euros. They deny wrongdoing. Former chief operating officer Jan Marsalek is on the run.
The company's collapse has highlighted Germany's lax oversight of financial firms, prompting authorities from regulator BaFin to local government to deflect responsibility for what one top official conceded was a ""total disaster"".

""Instead of explaining itself, the government is stone walling,"" said Lisa Paus, of the Green party, announcing the alliance with the Left party and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) in launching the probe.

A separate report on Tuesday showed that the eurozone fell back into deflation last month for the first time since mid-2016, another indication of the economic fallout from the pandemic. While low inflation gives a boost to consumers, it will raise alarm at the European Central Bank, increasing the chance that it will have to expand stimulus before the end of the year.

There has been no official confirmation of media reports that Abbott, a Brexit supporter, will become a member of Britain's Board of Trade but his possible appointment has stirred criticism from opposition lawmakers.
Abbott said he could not comment until the appointment was made official, but the right-wing head of Australia's government between 2013 and 2015 used a speech at the London-based Policy Exchange think tank to set out his approach to trade.
""I am obviously a supporter of freer trade, particularly freer trade between like-minded countries with comparable standards of living,"" he said. ""So a free-trade deal between Australia and Great Britain would be, I would like to think, an absolutely unambiguous good for everyone.""
A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters that ""no decisions about the Board of Trade have been made"".
The Board of Trade is headed by trade minister Liz Truss and, the government says, it ""champions exports, inward investment and outward direct investment to deliver economic growth and prosperity across ... the United Kingdom"".
The trade policy chief for Britain's main opposition Labour Party, Emily Thornberry, has said it would be ""absolutely staggering"" if Johnson were to appoint Abbott, saying he has ""no hands-on experience of negotiating trade agreements"".
But many members of the governing Conservative Party would welcome Abbott's appointment. Several have said his support for Britain's departure from the European Union underlined his credentials for promoting it.
Others have praised his critical view of China and on Tuesday he advised caution in pursuing a free-trade agreement with Beijing.

""I think it (free trade) is a different issue where countries have got widely divergent standards of living,"" he said. ""I certainly think it's a different issue where you've got a country like China that sees trade as a potential strategic weapon and can turn things on and off like a tap.""

792,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Japan’s Suga Favorite to Succeed Abe After Party Limits Vote,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party adopted a structure for a vote to replace outgoing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that could help the premier’s right-hand man, Yoshihide Suga, take over.
Party officials decided on a system Tuesday that would give more weight to lawmakers in the party over rank and file members, LDP General Council Chairman Shunichi Suzuki told reporters.
The move comes as Suga appears to be picking up enough support among powerful factions of lawmakers, which put him far ahead of any contender. The system decreases the influence of regional voters, who have previously shown support for a top rival, former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who on Tuesday officially declared his candidacy.
Suzuki didn’t announce a date for the vote. Some party leaders have told local media the election will either be Sept. 14 or 15, with a new prime minister selected by parliament on Sept. 16 or 17.
Market players have been betting that Suga would take over from Abe and the LDP’s decision on the election process caused few ripples among traders. Japan’s Topix index fell Friday on Abe’s shock resignation before recovering Monday, though Warren Buffett’s interest in the nation’s trading houses certainly helped the rebound.
Suga, who served as chief cabinet secretary under Abe, will hold a news conference Wednesday to officially declare his candidacy, broadcaster TBS and the Sankei newspaper reported.
Abe Aide Leads Field to Succeed Japan’s Longest-Serving Premier
Former Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida also declared Tuesday he was running while two other potential successors, current Defense Minister Taro Kono and former Internal Affairs Minister Seiko Noda, dropped out.
Stacking the Vote
During the last ruling party vote in 2018, ballots were divided evenly between members of parliament and rank-and-file officials, with each getting 394 votes -- for 788 in total.
The vote will be tilted this time, with 394 for lawmakers and 141 for local officials: Three for each of the party’s 47 prefecture chapters, and 535 votes in total.
Stacking the vote with sitting lawmakers benefits a network of LDP bosses and personality-based internal factions. The groups, each with their own leader and agenda, battle within the party for top posts and policy priorities.
Even before the race officially begins, three factions with a total of 155 lawmakers have shown support for Suga, who is not in any group. Abe leads the biggest faction with nearly 100 members. Although the group hasn’t endorsed a candidate, it’s expected that its members would lean toward Abe’s top lieutenant over a rival candidate.
Suga also has the support of more than a dozen non-aligned lawmakers -- and if all those factions and lawmakers break his way, he would have more than half of the votes needed to win the race.
Health Scare
Abe’s abrupt decision last week to step down after nearly eight years due to a health problem left the party scrambling to find a new leader in about two weeks. Whoever wins will have no more than a year to try and revive Japan’s economy from a pandemic-induced contraction before calling a general election against a recently unified opposition.
LDP Secretary General Toshihiro Nikai, influential in shaping the election process, told reporters Tuesday the party needed to act quickly to avoid any political vacuum and parliament should meet soon after the LDP’s vote to elect a new prime minister.
Despite Suga’s momentum within the LDP, the most popular candidate in opinion surveys of the general public is Ishiba, the ex-defense minister, who has backed policies for rural development and said Tuesdays that he is worried about stalling income growth. He won the rank-and-file vote over Abe in 2012, but lost the overall race.
Ishiba leads his own faction within the LDP, but it has only 19 members. The other declared contender, Kishida leads a group with 47 members.

793,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Economists Spar Over Whether U.K. Should Lift Tax to Tackle Debt,"(Bloomberg) -- Fiscal policy experts clashed over whether Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak should raise taxes to tackle the U.K.’s ballooning debt pile in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
“Our tax take is significantly below the rate of many other countries” in northern and Western Europe, Institute for Fiscal Studies Director Paul Johnson told the House of Commons Treasury Committee on Tuesday. “That does implicate that it is possible to run a pretty effective and efficient economy with a higher tax burden than the U.K. currently has.”
Johnson was backed up by two other panelists at the hearing, Institute for Government Chief Economist Gemma Tetlow and Resolution Foundation Chief Economist Mike Brewer. But Professor Philip Booth, a fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs, warned that “you damage the economy with a tax system a long time before you get to the point at which you can’t raise any more taxes.”
Sunak faces the challenge of reining in a national debt that’s ballooned to more than 2 trillion pounds ($2.7 trillion) for the first time amid the cost of supporting the economy through the pandemic, without suffocating the recovery from what may be the country’s worst recession in three centuries.
The Office for Budget Responsibility has calculated that a fiscal tightening equal to 60 billion pounds will be needed every decade to return debt from its current levels above 100% of GDP to a long-term sustainable rate around 75% by 2070.
Tory Backlash
With a budget planned for the fall, U.K. newspapers in recent days have reported that the Treasury plans to raise taxes on fuel, corporations and capital gains, while lowering tax relief on pensions. That’s sparked a backlash from members of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party who oppose tax hikes.
Economists appearing before the Treasury Committee agreed that now is not the time to be raising taxes, however, given the prospect of a sharp rise in unemployment as government aid comes to an end and the risk of a second wave of cornavirus infections. Johnson said he’d be surprised if there significant increases were introduced before 2022.
Prior to the pandemic, the U.K. tax take amounted to about 37% of economic output, well below rates of around 47% in Italy and Germany and above 50% in France and Finland. Britain’s decade of austerity following the financial crisis placed the heaviest burden on spending, which was slashed by around 7 percentage points of GDP.
The economists were responding to questioning from committee member Julie Marson, a Conservative lawmaker, who asked whether they agreed with her assessment that “there’s a strong body of evidence that suggests that we are at or at least very close to the upper limit of the taxable capacity.”
“We shouldn’t think of it as the upper limit now,” Tetlow said. “What matters more importantly is the structure of the tax system and how it influences economic behavior. A well-designed tax system could raise more money whilst doing less to distort activity than a very poorly-designed tax system, and there certainly are areas for improvement.”
Panelists earlier suggested measures that could reduce distortions as including broadening the range of goods subject to value added tax and leveling the tax treatment of the self-employed with the employed.

Investing.com - Our senior markets analyst Jesse Cohen gives us his top five things to know in financial markets on Tuesday, September 1, including:
 
1. Stocks Set To Open Mostly Higher As Tech Shares Gain
2. Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) Soars After Blowout Earnings


3. Dollar Falls To More Than 2-Year Low
4. Gold, Silver Rally
5. U.S. ISM Manufacturing PMI At 10AM ET"
795,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 06:38AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Tuesday, September 1st","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The dollar hits a new 29-month low as global economies appear to rebound faster than expected. Will the ISM manufacturing survey show a similar picture for the U.S.? Zoom Video blows past expectations, and oil firms ahead of the API's weekly estimate of U.S. inventories. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, September 1st.
1. Euro tests $1.20 as Germany gets more upbeat
Germany said its economic contraction this year won’t be as bad as first feared. New projections from the government estimate gross domestic product will fall ‘only’ 5.8% this year, instead of the 6.3% laid out in its last forecasts.
The flip side is that the rebound next year will be less vigorous – only 4.4% growth instead of 5.2%. Berlin still only expects to return to early 2020 levels of GDP at the start of 2022.
Germany’s jobless rolls fell by 9,000 in August, according to seasonally-adjusted data released earlier Tuesday, while its manufacturing PMI was confirmed at 52.0, a modest improvement from July, but lower than expected.
The euro rose as far as $1.1998, helping to drive the dollar index down to a new 29-month low.
2. Zoom on course to win 2020
 Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) cemented its place as one of the biggest winners of 2020, reporting quarterly earnings that were far ahead of even the most optimistic forecast and substantially raising its guidance for the full year.
The company reported a 355% increase in revenue from the same period a year ago to $663 million, more than the whole of its fiscal 2020 year that ended in January. Net profit rose to $186 million from $6 million a year earlier.
The numbers suggest that Zoom has more than met the challenge of scaling up rapidly in the face of an unimaginable surge in demand over the last six months. Its corporate customer base has more than quadrupled from a year earlier. 
3. Stocks set to open mostly higher
U.S. stock markets are expected to open mostly higher again, with Zoom’s blowout earnings helping Nasdaq futures to extend the outperformance seen on Monday  
By 6:35 AM ET (1035 GMT), the Dow 30 futures contract was essentially flat while S&P 500 Futures were up 0.2% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 1.0%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and its suppliers are likely to stay in focus after Bloomberg reported that the company is preparing to make 75 million iPhones in its big round of launches in October, a figure that's roughly in line with last year and suggests demand for its flagship product has held up well through the pandemic.
4. PMIs point to global resilience
The Institute for Supply Management will release its purchasing managers index for the U.S. at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT).
Releases of similar surveys around the world have mainly come in stronger than expected, with the Caixin PMI for China, which monitors the country’s private sector, rising to 53.1.
In Europe, the picture was more uneven, with manufacturing PMIs pointing to faster growth in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, but a return to contraction in Spain, where the surge in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks is now approaching the level seen during the virus’ first wave in spring. The eurozone jobless rate rose to 7.9% despite the widespread availability of government wage subsidies, while the collapse in energy prices drove the consumer price index to a year-on-year decline of 0.2%.
Elsewhere, South Korea, whose chip- and electronic-heavy economy occupies a key place in global value chains, said its second-quarter GDP had fallen only 3.2%, after a 1.3% drop in the first quarter, slightly better than the 3.3% drop forecast.
5. Oil grinds higher; API numbers eyed
Oil prices ground higher in overnight trading after positive economic data from Korea and Germany gave some reassurance to those worried about the strength of global demand.
By 6:30 AM, U.S. crude futures had risen 1.1% to $43.08 a barrel, while the global benchmark Brent had risen 1.2% to $45.84 a barrel.
The market was supported by figures released late on Monday by the U.S. government showing the extent of the drop in U.S. output earlier in the summer.  With Baker Hughes’ oil rig count still bumping along the bottom of a multi-year trend at 180 last week, U.S. output seems unlikely to revive quickly.
The American Petroleum Institute’s weekly estimate of U.S. oil supplies is due at 4:30 PM, as usual. They're likely to reflect the disruptions to the market from last week's hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Missing the thrill of air travel during the coronavirus lockdown? A Nigerian restaurant is now offering its customers the illusion of flight without them ever having to leave the ground.
The diners at Urban Air in the Nigerian capital Abuja sit on plush white seats and peruse a flight-themed cocktail menu beside windows illustrated with blue skies and puffy white clouds.
Some customers take selfies as staff leave the 'cockpit' to serve them.
""The environment is really amazing considering this corona stuff,"" said IT worker Fatima Garba during her second visit.
""It's been a while since we've all got to sit inside of an airplane and this just reminds us of that.""
Nigeria has suspended all international commercial flights since late March. It also curtailed domestic flights for several months, though they have since resumed.
Restaurant owner Ugo Young said even his partner, who is also head chef, had questioned whether a flight-themed restaurant would work. Undaunted, Young spent more than 10 million naira ($26,281) converting the space to look just like an airplane.
Since opening on August 15, it has served roughly 100 adventure-hungry Nigerians each day.
Young said the eatery provides a safe, affordable experience for nostalgic fliers. 
""This COVID period, where people haven't gotten to travel... they could come here and feel as though they are in the air,"" Young said.
For some, the restaurant, whose meals start at 2,000 naira, could be the closest they get to the skies for some time. While international flights are set to resume on Sept. 5, returning to Nigeria will entail pricey coronavirus tests, in addition to the airfare.
Divine Akufu, a 20-year-old student, said her selfies at Urban Air made her look like a first-class adventurer.
""It looks like a private jet here,"" she said.

The European Banking Authority's (EBA) then executive director Adam Farkas resigned in 2019 to head the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME).
The Ombudsman said in May that Farkas' appointment should not have been allowed, finding two instances of ""maladministration"" by EBA, and made three recommendations for the watchdog to implement.
The EBA coordinates stress tests on leading lenders, obtaining commercially sensitive information to see if they can withstand major shocks unaided.
The Ombudsman's recommendations included the need to, when necessary, forbid senior staff from taking up outside positions for a certain period of time after their term of office ends.
The EBA has ""worked hard"" to implement the recommendations, the Ombudsman said in a statement on Tuesday.
""I am confident that the wide range of measures it has introduced will help it avoid damaging revolving door moves in the future. Other EU institutions and agencies should draw on these new EBA safeguards when revising their own rules,"" it said.
""I also welcome the European Commission's decision to put in place a two-year Commission-wide cooling off period on meetings with the CEO of AFME until 1 February 2022.""
EBA Chairman Jose Manuel Campa said EBA needs input from the banking sector to carry out its work, but there are internal procedures to ensure that its staff remain impartial and independent.
EBA recognises that it ""took some time"" to completely remove Farkas' access to confidential information at the watchdog, Campa said, adding that in May it prohibited Farkas from becoming a board member of TheCityUK, a UK financial services lobby, for a period of time.

800,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 02:50AM ET</span>",Philippines says won't stop projects with China firms blacklisted by U.S,"By Neil Jerome Morales
MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines will not halt infrastructure projects involving Chinese firms blacklisted by ally the United States and will make its own decisions, not those of a foreign power, the president's spokesman said on Tuesday.
President Rodrigo Duterte will not follow Washington's move to sanction Chinese firms involved in building and militarising artificial South China Sea islands because infrastructure was a national priority, his spokesman Harry Roque said.
""We are not a vassal state of any foreign power and we will pursue our national interest,"" Roque told a regular news conference.
""Our national interest is to ensure flagship projects are completed.""
Duterte has a race against time to make headway in his $180 billion infrastructure overhaul, which is fraught with complications.
The United States, a defence treaty ally of the Philippines, has blacklisted 24 Chinese companies and targeted individuals over the building of military facilities on submerged reefs in disputed waters, escalating tensions with Beijing.
The Philippine foreign minister had recommended his government terminates deals with those entities.
Duterte's non-intervention could cause some friction, as several of China's islands challenge his country's interests, most notably Mischief Reef, built within its 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone and equipped with missiles capable of striking the Philippines.
Among firms involved are China Communications Construction Co (CCCC) (SS:601800), which is has teamed up with a Philippine partner for a $10 billion airport project, and its subsidiary, China Harbour Engineering Company, which is partnering on a $1.2 billion reclamation project with the firm of tycoon Dennis Uy, Duterte's associate and biggest election campaign donor. 
China Harbour will partner also with the Philippines' richest family on separate $1.86 billion reclamation venture.
Those firms have not responded to Reuters requests for comment on the blacklisting.
Opposition lawmaker Risa Hontiveros filed a senate resolution on Tuesday to investigate possible collusion by Filipinos over China's artificial islands.
""It is not hard to suspect dubious engagement by either party,"" Hontiveros said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Whoever succeeds Shinzo Abe as Japan's prime minister will be confronted with growing signs that the job market is deteriorating in an economy laid low by the coronavirus pandemic.
Top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga is emerging as a front-runner to become next premier, heightening the chance the government will continue down the policy course set by Abe - notably the ""Abenomics"" strategy aimed at reviving the economy.
But the widening damage from COVID-19 is threatening job creation, among the few successes of Abenomics.
Japan's unemployment rate crept up to 2.9% in July and job availability fell to a more than six-year low, data showed on Tuesday. Nearly 2 million people lost their jobs in July, about 410,000 more than in the same month last year, with the number of job losses rising for six straight months through July.
Among the hardest hit have been non-permanent workers, who make up nearly 40% of Japan's workforce and are concentrated in industries like hotels, restaurants and entertainment.
The number of temporary workers fell by 1.31 million in July from a year ago, the biggest drop in more than 6-1/2 years.
""We're seeing more non-permanent workers lose their jobs, especially in industries vulnerable to the pandemic,"" said Shinya Kodera, an economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
Government subsidies and Japan's unique labour practice, prioritising job security over wage hikes, have kept the jobless rate low compared with around 10% in the United States.
But the pandemic is even starting to affect hiring of university graduates, who until recently had no trouble landing jobs due to chronic labour shortages in an ageing population.
As of Aug. 1, the ratio of students with job offers stood at 83.7%, 4.5 percentage points below the 2019 level, according to employment information provider Disco (OTC:DSCSY) (6146.T).
Analysts say conditions have already taken a sharp turn for the worse as companies face pressure to slash labour costs.
""In Japan, workers can't be laid off easily even when the economy turns bad. So firms will make adjustments in graduate hiring,"" said Taro Saito, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute.
Naoki Ishihara, a 24-year-old graduating this year, had a job offer from a design company cancelled in February. ""It was an offer for a job that I wanted to do, so it was a shock when it was withdrawn,"" he told Reuters.
Job losses may spike when government subsidies to firms who keep employees under furlough end in December, analysts say.
Nobuyuki Sato, who owns a Japanese-style hotel in Yamagata, in northeast Japan, says the subsidies have helped him keep jobs even when his hotel was closed.

""I'm hoping the government will extend the subsidies for another year,"" Sato said. ""It's hard to expect the infection number to start falling early next year,"" he said.

803,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 02:40AM ET</span>","Asia's factories shaking off COVID gloom, China shines","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian factories continued to shake off the coronavirus gloom in August as more bright signs in China raised hopes of a firmer recovery in global demand, reducing pressure on policymakers to take bolder steps to avert a deeper recession.
Manufacturing activity in China expanded at the fastest clip in nearly a decade in August, as factories ramped up output to meet rebounding demand, a private survey showed. New export orders rose for the first time this year.
The upbeat findings contrasted with an official survey on Monday, which showed China's factory activity grew at a slightly slower pace in August.
But fears of a resurgence in infections in some economies may discourage firms from boosting capital expenditure and delay a sustained rebound for the Asian region, some analysts say.
""In most major economies, except for China, factories are still running well below pre-pandemic capacity levels,"" said Ryutaro Kono, chief Japan economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
""The recent recovery is largely due to pent-up demand after lockdown measures were lifted, which will dwindle ahead.""
China's Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) rose to 53.1 in August from July's 52.8, marking the biggest rate of expansion since January 2011.
Japan and South Korea both saw factory output contract at the slowest pace in six months in August, reinforcing expectations the region's export powerhouses have past their worst from a collapse in demand after COVID-19 struck.
The spill-over to other parts of Asia, however, remains patchy. While manufacturing activity rose in Taiwan and Indonesia, they slid in the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia.
India's factory output grew in August for the first time in five months as the easing of lockdown restrictions spurred demand. But analysts do not expect a quick turnaround in the economy, which contracted at its steepest pace on record last quarter.
PANDEMIC, POLITICS DAMPEN SENTIMENT
The global economy is gradually emerging from the health-crisis-led downturn thanks in part to massive fiscal and monetary stimulus programmes.
But many analysts expect any recovery to be feeble as renewed waves of infections dent business activity and prevent many nations from fully re-opening their economies.
In Australia, the central bank on Tuesday unexpectedly expanded a programme to provide lenders with low-cost funding as the virus-hit economy braced for its worst contraction since the Great Depression.
Japan's final au Jibun Bank Manufacturing PMI rose to a seasonally adjusted 47.2 in August from 45.2 in July, marking the slowest contraction since February.
The survey followed data on Monday showing factory output rose in July at the fastest pace on record, as automakers ramped up production after facing factory closures in past months.
South Korea's PMI also rose to 48.5 in August from 46.9 in July, the highest reading since February, though it remained below the 50-mark threshold that separates growth from contraction for an eighth straight month.
While South Korea's exports fell for a sixth straight month in August, the trade data - first to be reported among major exporting economies - signalled a gradual recovery in global demand.
""Exports will continue to recover during the second half and turn positive next year,"" said Chun Kyu-yeon, economist at Hana Financial Investment. ""Global demand are clearly showing recovery along with economic resumptions,"" she added.
Some analysts warn against being too optimistic.
South Korea's latest PMI findings did not fully reflect a recent resurgence in domestic coronavirus inflections in mid- to late-August.
Japanese firms cut capital expenditure by the most in a decade in the second quarter, data showed on Tuesday, a sign the pandemic was sapping corporate appetite to spend.
Japan is also in the midst of a leadership change after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said last week he will step down, raising uncertainty about the policy outlook.

""There is ... a risk that the leadership transition could bring about a period of policy paralysis and uncertainty, should Japan experience a run of frequent changes in premierships, as occurred prior to 2012,"" Fitch Ratings said in a research note.

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to online banking in Europe, but it has also given some suburban branches an unexpected new purpose – as alternative office spaces for staff reluctant to commute to big HQs in city centres.
Lenders have been slowly cutting the number of often unprofitable branches for years, but opposition from unions and politicians over leaving people without access to a physical outlet meant many were unable to cut on the scale they wanted.
Some are now looking to speed up closures to cut costs and better weather the crisis, including  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
But others are changing tack. They are looking to take advantage of part of their networks of physical outposts to help adapt their businesses to the new reality. 
""Banks will try to change them rather than just closing a huge number of unprofitable branches,"" said Daniel Dawson, an associate at banking research firm RBR.
In Britain, Virgin Money (L:VMUK) said it was identifying branches where office staff who live locally could work rather than travelling into city centre offices, while Santander's (MC:SAN) UK unit said it was exploring a similar approach. 
Lloyds (L:LLOY), the UK's biggest domestic bank, said it would launch ""experiments"" to test ""how, where and when"" its more than 60,000 employees could work from October.
""There's a lot of conversations (within banks) about wellbeing, particularly in the winter months. The branch network can play a really vital role if it's a safer environment to commute to,"" said Sarah-Jane Osborne, a partner at property consultancy Arcadis, who has been advising banks.
A MANAGED DECLINE
The number of bank branches in the European Union fell from around 238,000 in 2008 to 174,000 at the end of 2018 according to the European Banking Federation. 
The decline is likely to continue, as the overriding trend in banking is customers increasingly moving online - and this has only quickened during the pandemic. 
Yet for some lenders, the new challenges posed by the pandemic are giving pause for thought. 
""I think COVID-19 presents a new lease of life for branches specifically,"" said John Cronin, banking analyst at Goodbody, who said he knew of several British banks considering allowing office staff to work from branches.
In Britain, banks have disclosed plans to close around 265 branches so far this year, according to data from consumer group Which?, well short of the peak of 868 in 2017.
The COVID-19 crisis is also accelerating some banks' plans to remodel their branches. 
RBR's Dawson predicts, for example, that other lenders could follow the example of TSB, part of Spanish bank Sabadell (MC:SABE), in phasing out lower-grade frontline positions, and look instead to bring in more advisory services.
""Doing less basic transactions allows branch staff to concentrate on other things like advice and sales which are more profitable for the banks,"" said Dawson, adding banks could roll out more automated or video services that allow customers to withdraw large amounts of cash or get a replacement debit card.
GERMAN 'BRANCH OF FUTURE'
In Germany, regional lender Volksbank Stuttgart is now planning to repurpose eight - about a tenth - of its branches, with half offering only advisory services, and the others becoming self-service centres without any staff.
""Customers are changing their behaviour and it's an open secret that banks are making changes,"" said board member Michael Huppert.
Oldenburgische Landesbank in northern German has accelerated plans to bundle customer support services into larger locations, while transforming smaller branches into self-service facilities or closing them.
""The coronavirus pandemic has affected the timing of the conversion for a few branches,"" said Svenja-Marie Gnida, who sits on the bank's supervisory board.
In September, the bank is opening a new adviser centre in Oldenburg that will house several hundred staff for video, telephone, app and online services.
André Hasken of ZEB Consulting said the pandemic had focused lenders' minds on how to squeeze the most business out of branches.

""Banks are basically asking themselves how they want to design the branch of the future,"" he added.

805,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 01:09AM ET</span>","Welcome Back to School, Britain’s Economy Is Counting On You","(Bloomberg) -- Sara Vickery-Bragg has a company in London preparing mail-order gift boxes and her husband runs his own technology firm. They have also been nannies, teachers and entertainers for two small children since March.
Like for so many parents, that combination of roles is finally about to end in the U.K. as most of England’s 24,000 schools reopen over the next week, a critical moment in getting the country back to work and the economy out of the worst slump for centuries. For Vickery-Bragg, sending her 4-year-old son for his first day of term means no longer having to frantically pack orders while the kids are watching television or eating dinner.
“It’s more time than I’ve had in six months so it will feel like a bit of a luxury,” said Vickery-Bragg, 35, who is now seeking a nursery place for her toddler. Returning to normal “is not going to be overnight, but I feel like anything that makes working life easier is just something to be grateful for at the moment,” she added.
The juggle of work and children resonates across the world in the era of coronavirus, but the reopening of schools in Britain has taken on greater political and economic significance because the country has been hit by the pandemic more than anywhere else in Europe. Getting pupils back into the classroom is now paramount to avoiding deeper pain rather than simply a calculated risk.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is already facing a public inquiry over his handling of the crisis, while chaos last month over grading for school leavers also cost his governing Conservatives in the polls. A U-turn over face coverings in high schools saw Education Secretary Gavin Williamson field another barrage of criticism, even from within the party.
Reopening schools could provide a 3.3% boost to the economy, equivalent to 70 billion pounds ($93 billion) a year, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research. The report, published on Monday, said as many as 5% more employees would be able to return to their workplaces.
The U.K. has experienced the biggest drop in employment since the global financial crisis and, unlike Germany, is preparing to end a furlough program. The government is starting a publicity campaign this week to get people back into offices as job losses mount at retailers in city centers.
A study by academics in Cambridge, Oxford and Zurich found that women are particularly vulnerable, with more of them likely to have requested state aid to cover their income. Schools and nurseries now need to be up and running smoothly by the time the program runs out in October, said Christopher Rauh, a Cambridge University economics lecturer and one of the report’s authors.
“If this double whammy happens, then we’re going to see either enforced layoffs or voluntary layoffs pretty quickly, because there will be no other options,” he said.
Teachers have expressed their anxieties about going back to work, a sense of not being prepared for the challenge of keeping children apart and dealing with potential Covid-19 cases in schools. 
Read More: Boris Johnson’s Next Big Test Is Getting Britain Back to School
The government says it’s confident that guidelines will ensure safety of pupils and staff, with staggered starts and some social distancing. It pointed to data from the Office for National Statistics showing the overwhelming majority of parents are comfortable sending their children back. A report published on Friday found that all children who died of Covid-19 were already seriously ill. It was based on a study of 260 hospitals in England, Wales and Scotland.
In an open letter to parents at the weekend, Williamson warned that keeping children away from school could jeopardize their future prospects. 
It followed Johnson’s direct appeal to families on Aug. 24, when he said the risk of contracting Covid-19 in school was “very small” and it was “far more damaging” for a child’s development and well-being to stay at home. He previously said it would be “economically unsustainable” to keep schools closed.
The hope is that parents are not only freed up to increase output from home, but also to return to the workplace and nearby gyms, sandwich shops and pubs. In London, less than half of employees are back, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) data show. Use of public transport remains 44% below the baseline set before Covid-19 rocked the economy, according to the figures.
But reopening schools isn’t likely to be a quick fix. Many schools are choosing not to immediately set up wrap-around childcare because of the difficulties in mixing class “bubbles.”
Carley Taylor, a dental nurse from Camberley in southern England whose two sons aged seven and 13 are going back to school, said she was preparing to cut her days short to pick up her youngest. She is unlikely to see her first patient before 10 a.m. and would have to finish work at 2:45 p.m., effectively cutting her pre-coronavirus workday in half.
“It’s a logistical nightmare at the best of times as a working parent,” said Taylor. “But a Covid logistical nightmare is just on another level.”
Parents of young children also face the prospect of repeated coronavirus testing as they contract coughs and colds when they come into contact with their peers after months of staying at home. One headteacher of a primary school in Surrey, who asked not to be named, said any pupil with a fever would be moved to a designated room to wait to be taken home. They would not be allowed back in school for 10 days or until they could produce a negative test.
In Scotland, where schools returned in mid-August, more than 17,500 pupils were tested for the virus in a week, with 49 returning as positive. High-school pupils in Scotland are required to wear masks in communal areas, but in England it will be at the discretion of the headteacher unless the school is in a local lockdown area.
There are also issues with staggered drop-offs and pick-ups shortening the working day, particularly for people with more than one child at school. Some parents will see their children only going in one day a week at first, with the number of days rising in the coming weeks.
Sara McCorquodale, 37, who runs a company providing insights to brands about social-media influencers, is just glad for some respite for both her and the family after domestic and work life merged during lockdown. She has been juggling her business, CORQ, with her two sons aged one and six. The elder boy is returning to school to start his third year. 
“It has been incredibly hard—the phone is ringing or I have commitments with work or his baby brother is crying—and I think just for him to have that six hours that is focused on him will be really valuable,” she said. “Finally I’ll be able to separate home and work more.”

SEOUL (Reuters) - Measures imposed in South Korea to blunt a surge in coronavirus cases will hurt Asia's fourth-biggest economy, the government warned on Tuesday, after unprecedented restrictions went into effect in Seoul and surrounding areas.
South Korea's economy shrunk by a seasonally adjusted 3.2% in the April-June period from the previous quarter, revised central bank data showed, the sharpest contraction since the final quarter of 2008. South Korean exports fell for a sixth straight month in August.
The government unveiled plans to increase spending aggressively for the next few years and said it was prepared to boost policy support should the rate of infection worsen significantly.
""(Some) downturns are inevitable in the real economy due to the tightened preventive measures,"" Vice Finance Minister Kim Yong-beom said at a policy meeting.
Daily cases have dropped slightly for five straight days, although they have remained in the low-hundreds for nearly three weeks as a second wave of infections sweeps through densely populated Seoul and spreads around the country.
South Korea on Friday restricted the operation of restaurants, coffee shops and so-called cram schools in the greater Seoul area. Churches, nightclubs and most public schools had already been ordered to close.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 235 new coronavirus cases as of midnight Monday, bringing the country's total to 20,182 cases and 324 deaths.
To counter a slump in exports and the retail sector, the government said it planned to boost spending on welfare and jobs by 10.7%, and allocate 11.9% more on social infrastructure projects.
The central bank kept interest rates steady on Thursday, but sharply downgraded its 2020 growth outlook. The Bank of Korea said gross domestic product would likely shrink 1.3% in 2020 - the biggest contraction in more than two decades - from a previous forecast for a 0.2% decline.
BED SHORTAGES
The second wave has depleted medical facilities, with less than 3% of beds, or a total of nine, available for critical cases in greater Seoul, down from 22% about 10 days ago, according to the health ministry.
The KCDC reported 104 patients are in serious condition as of midnight Monday, more than an eightfold growth from two weeks before.
The ministry and Seoul city authorities said dozens more hospital beds will be ready this week.
""We're in a very difficult situation especially due to the increase in the number of older patients,"" Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said.
In the latest blow to economic activity, a minor league baseball pitcher tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday, the Korea Baseball Organisation (KBO) said, casting doubt on the rest of the sport's season.
The KBO said all of the 42 people who came in contact with the player had tested negative and gone into isolation, and it had cancelled two minor league games planned for Tuesday.

In late July, fans had been allowed to attend baseball games in limited numbers, but with the rising number of infections, stadiums were once again closed to fans by mid-August.

Asked about the collapse of talks with Democrats over aid legislation, Mnuchin told Fox Business Network that he and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows have been speaking regularly with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell.
""Hopefully Mitch will enter new legislation next week,"" Mnuchin said.
No negotiations on another round of coronavirus aid have taken place since early August, when talks collapsed as Congressional Democrats and the Republican Trump administration could not bridge a gap of more than $1 trillion between their proposed relief packages for small businesses, state and local governments, school districts and health care providers.
Trump has since signed an executive order extending expired supplemental unemployment benefits and deferring some payroll taxes, but details on implementation have been uncertain.
Mnuchin said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer ""just don't want to negotiate in good faith. They've refused to meet.""
""We're gong to keep trying because it's too important for the American people,"" Mnuchin said, adding that he has been holding daily calls with McConnell and other congressional Republicans.
""Hopefully Mitch will enter new legislation next week"" that will provide aid for children, jobs and liability protections for small businesses.
Mnuchin is due to testify on Tuesday before the Democrat-controlled House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis on the administration's economic response.
Republicans who control the U.S. Senate have discussed proceeding with their own legislation that would be narrower than the House's $3 trillion plan approved in May, but thus far have not introduced any new proposals. Some Republicans oppose new aid out of concern for a massive and growing budget deficit predicted to approach $4 trillion this year.
Meadows said on Friday that Trump was willing to sign a $1.3 trillion coronavirus relief bill, up from an initial proposal of $1 trillion.

Pelosi had reduced Democrats' initial $3 trillion demand to $2.2 trillion but was insisting on the need for new funds for state and local governments, schools and coronavirus testing and tracing of infections.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Labor Department on Monday proposed new limits on retirement plan fiduciaries from voting on corporate proxies when they cannot specify an economic benefit, a change that would further efforts to curb financial industry support for environmental or social causes.
The proposal comes as many shareholder initiatives on topics like climate change have gained more backing.
Top investment managers had largely opposed another Trump administration proposal to make it harder for retirement plans to use funds focused on goals like investing in renewable energy.
Material provided by a Labor Department spokeswoman said the agency took action as institutional investors came to own 80.3% of the top 500 American companies as of 2017, up from 47% of the largest 1,000 in 1987, diminishing the influence of funds it regulates under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
Retirement plans under the law are private and employer-sponsored, like 401(k)s and pension plans. Some state pension plans also follow the department's guidance, magnifying the importance of rule changes in Washington.
The department said it was concerned some fiduciaries and proxy advisers ""may be acting in ways that unwittingly allow plan assets to be used to support or pursue proxy proposals for environmental, social, or public policy agendas that have no connection to increasing the value of investments.""
Sanford Lewis, an attorney representing groups that often file shareholder resolutions, called the action ""a remarkable misstep"" by the agency.

""Under the changes, funds would be prohibited from voting on proposals unless they could find a narrow economic justification, rather than a justification based on ethics, impact on society, or on corporate governance,"" Lewis said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's statistical agency is paying close attention to the ""pot of cash"" that Canadians have saved up amid the COVID-19 pandemic as it looks to understand who is saving and how that money may contribute to the shape of the recovery.
Prior to the pandemic, Canadians saved just 2-3% of their disposable income, but that jumped to 28.2% in the second quarter of this year, Greg Peterson, Assistant Chief Statistician responsible for Economic Statistics at Statistics Canada, told Reuters on Monday.
""There's that pot of cash that's basically sitting there and we're interested in monitoring where that goes,"" Peterson said. ""It's kind of a notable divergence from what we normally see.""
One of the main questions is whether the extra money will go toward paying down household debt or whether it will be spent on goods and services, Peterson said. 
The economy is now showing signs of having put the worst behind it, and Canada's real GDP is seen rebounding 3% in July, edging economic activity closer to pre-pandemic levels, data showed last week.
The jump in the savings rate came in the second quarter amid a unique set of circumstances: disposable incomes climbed sharply on higher government transfers - namely emergency wage benefits - while household spending fell amid COVID-19 shutdowns. 
The agency is looking at producing more quarterly data on things like household income and savings rate by income quintile, something which they've only broken out on annual basis in the past, Peterson said.
Separately, the agency will continue to produce its so-called ""flash estimates"" for key indicators for the foreseeable future. It started issuing preliminary numbers for indicators like monthly retails sales as speed became increasingly important amid the pandemic.

""For as long as people are happy with receiving early indicators, with that possibility of a bigger revision, then I see no reason why we wouldn't continue,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday urged a federal appeals court not to let Manhattan's top prosecutor have his tax returns, saying ""the deck was clearly stacked against"" him, and said he would ask the Supreme Court to intervene if necessary.
The argument was made in a filing with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, which on Tuesday will hear arguments on Trump's bid to delay Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance's subpoena for the tax returns during Trump's appeal.
Absent a delay, Trump requested a stay to give the Supreme Court time to consider his request.
A spokesman for Vance declined to comment.
The district attorney is seeking eight years of tax returns from Trump's longtime accounting firm Mazars USA in connection with a criminal probe of the president's business practices.
Trump has fought the subpoena for a year. He suffered a defeat in July when the Supreme Court rejected his claim of immunity from criminal probes while in the White House.
The tax returns are unlikely to become public before the Nov. 3 presidential election. Vance has said the continued litigation has effectively given Trump the ""temporary absolute immunity"" that courts have rejected.
On Aug. 20, U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero refused for a second time to block the subpoena, saying ""justice requires an end to this controversy.""
But Monday's filing said Trump was not resurrecting his broad immunity claim, arguing instead that the subpoena was overbroad and issued in bad faith, and that Vance should have to show why its contents were relevant to his probe.
""The District Attorney should not have been allowed to 'run roughshod' over the President in his pursuit of claims that the Supreme Court held he could raise,"" the filing said.
The filing said enforcing the subpoena would cause Trump irreparable harm.

""It is disclosure of these records to the government--not just to the public--that causes injury,"" it said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) relies on extensive worker surveillance to boost employee output and potentially limit unionization efforts around the United States, says a research paper issued on Monday by the Open Markets Institute.
The Washington-based research and advocacy group, focused on antitrust and monopoly power of technology companies, said Amazon uses such tools as navigation software, item scanners, wristbands, thermal cameras, security cameras and recorded footage to surveil its workforce in warehouses and stores.
The paper says Amazon moves employees around in what could be an attempt to limit union organizing. For example, it creates heat maps and uses data such as team-member sentiment and a diversity index to figure out which of its stores may have a higher risk of unionizing, the report says. 
This can have an impact on workers' ability to advocate for better working conditions and push for collective action, the paper said. 
Companies across industries use data on their workforce to boost output. Companies have increased surveillance during the coronavirus pandemic to track employees and maintain a healthy workforce, and also to track time they spend working as more people telecommute.
Amazon has faced scrutiny for how it treats its workers.
A company spokesman said Amazon has expectations from its employees and measures performance against those expectations.
""Associate performance is measured and evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things could impact the ability to meet expectations in any given day or hour,"" the spokesman said in a statement. ""We support people who are not performing to the levels expected with dedicated coaching to help them improve,"" he added.
Reuters reported in May that Amazon has long resisted unionization. Amazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said at the time that Amazon already offers what labor groups are requesting: $15 per hour or more to start, health benefits and opportunities for career growth. She said employee health and safety were the company's top priority.
Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute (OMI) and a former New York assistant attorney general, said: ""Our aim is to show how the tremendous imbalance of power between employers and workers gets exacerbated by an alarming increase in surveillance.""
The paper says invasive forms of worker surveillance should be prohibited and employers such as Amazon should obtain approval from state and federal agencies for non-invasive tracking measures that do not harm workers.
The research paper also says the National Labor Relations Board should prohibit certain types of surveillance and its use to limit unionization efforts.

If companies still do it, the burden must be on them to obtain approval from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), an agency under the Department of Labor, the paper said.

Some buyers are interested in assets that have become available after the virus and measures to stem it hurt Indonesia’s economy, Alexandra Askandar, corporate banking director at PT Bank Mandiri, said in an interview last week. Growth in loans to large businesses will likely accelerate in the second half from an expansion of 3.4% in the first six months, she said, declining to give an exact target.
“There is demand for loans which have been triggered by this pandemic as some companies are selling their assets,” according to Askandar, 48. “Some of the financing that we provide is to support these acquisitions, such as for oil and gas assets, as well as power plants.”
Indonesia’s economy contracted for the first time in more than two decades in the second quarter, but is showing signs of recovery after the government eased some restrictions on movement. Still, a number of borrowers including property developer PT Modernland Realty have missed or delayed debt payments as the pandemic weighs on business revenues.
Of 320 trillion rupiah ($22 billion) of loans under Askandar’s supervision, 50 trillion rupiah has been restructured, she said. Askandar said she’s confident that these loans won’t turn into non-performing assets after March 2021, when a government-sponsored program to ease debt payments is set to end, citing improvements in business activity.
The bank will shift its focus to expanding its corporate loan book again after spending most of the second quarter restructuring company debt, according to Askandar. Demand for funds will also come from enterprises looking to refinance maturing bonds, as market pricing isn’t currently favorable, she said.

814,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>","Framework complete, Fed faces election year call on next steps","By Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - With a new policy framework in place, the Federal Reserve will turn to discussion of its next steps in the fight against the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, and if and when to roll out additional support.
Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Monday that following release of the Fed's new long-run strategy last week, policymakers ""will be returning to a discussion of potentially refining guidance and our balance sheet communication,"" the Fed's now staple recession-fighting tools involving promises about future policy and the pace of monthly bond purchases. 
Clarida, during an event organized by the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, did not indicate how quickly that debate may be resolved, saying ""I don’t want to prejudge where that would end up.""
However the debate presents the central bank with an immediate challenge: Whether to announce those widely anticipated next steps at its September policy meeting, its last before the November presidential election, or wait. 
Some analysts have urged the Fed to act soon in order to show it is serious about the new strategy it laid out last week, trading the risk of higher inflation for stronger job growth, and argued that without such follow-up steps the new strategy seems hollow. But even they have noted the complications of acting in the midst of an election that may hinge on voter perceptions of the pandemic economy. 
""It is awkward for the Fed to make a big decision either in September...or in November – immediately after the vote, with the (Federal Open Market Committee) potentially appearing political either way,"" Evercore ISI vice president Krishna Guha wrote in an analysis, judging it a close call whether the Fed will announce new policy decisions in September or not.
The Fed in September of 2012 did announce its third and most open-ended program of bond purchases used to fight the last crisis, and was promptly pilloried by Republicans alleging the central bank was trying to fuel a sluggish recovery and help President Barack Obama's re-election that November.
This time around, the Fed in March slashed interest rates to zero and announced a long list of credit programs meant to halt a meltdown in financial markets and provide loans to an array of businesses, earning praise from President Donald Trump who through the previous fall had sharply criticized Fed policymakers and called Fed Chair Jerome Powell an ""enemy.""
DO MORE, BUT WHEN IT HELPS 
The Fed is widely expected to do more at some point, but Fed officials in recent weeks have indicated they don't want to commit to a course of action until the direction of the health crisis and recovery become clearer, and their policies may have more impact.
Actions like expanding bond purchases would aim to hold down the longer-term interest rates critical for home mortgage, auto and other markets - but those rates are already low. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion monthly in Treasury and mortgage-backed assets, and may at some point pledge to keep that amount in place until full employment is reached, or increase it. 
In addition, with investors already anticipating the Fed will hold its target policy rate near zero for years, there may be little value in making more explicit promises about rate hikes until years down the road, if and when investors think a rate increase is more possible. 
Last week several Fed policymakers said they saw little reason to offer more detailed guidance when the Fed has been clear rate hikes are far off. 
Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said Monday that further steps now might be counterproductive, distracting from the health, fiscal and other policies that in this moment are more important than what the Fed does next.
""As long as we have uncertainty about the trajectory of the pandemic there is only so much our policies are going to be able to do,"" he said.
Other Fed officials have made similar comments, arguing that the Fed's ability to ""stimulate"" spending may be more important when people feel it safer to begin traveling, for example, and spending and investing with more confidence. 
The Fed's new strategy implicitly points toward lower interest rates for longer, with the central bank saying it would allow higher inflation to offset periods of weak price increases in hopes of letting job markets tighten, wages rise, and workers gain more of the benefits from economic expansions.

What that means in practice may unfold over time, Clarida said on Monday. ""I would expect as the economy recovers and as we approach our dual mandate goals there will be further communication,"" about the Fed's plans.

The Government Accountability Office, in a brief update of its work to monitor the federal pandemic response, also said that as of the end of June the federal government still had about half of the $2.6 trillion that Congress approved in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
Monday’s filing following a June report that concluded the government’s quick action to issue stimulus payments led to more than a billion dollars of misdirected payments.
The June report made several recommendations, including that the Internal Revenue Service look at cost-effective options for notifying next-of-kin and others how to return almost 1.2 million in economic impact payments sent to deceased individuals.
The GAO said it wasn’t able to independently verify the Treasury Department’s statement about the amount recovered by the time it finished work on Monday’s report, but said that it’s working with Treasury to determine the number of payments.
“Treasury was considering sending letters to request the return of remaining outstanding payments but has not moved forward with this effort because, according to Treasury, Congress is considering legislation that would clarify or change payment eligibility requirements,” the report said.
The GAO also had recommended that Congress explicitly allow the Social Security Administration to share its full death data with the Treasury Department to prevent any future payments to ineligible individuals. The Senate passed a bill in June to do that, the report said.
Agencies are taking steps to respond to other recommendations, including that the Small Business Administration develop plans to identify and respond to risks and address potential fraud in the $669 billion Paycheck Protection Program, which offered forgivable loans to small firms, according to the report.
The SBA and Treasury have promised to review all loans of more than $2 million and potentially others as well. The SBA had approved more than 5.2 million loans totaling $525 billion when the program closed Aug. 8, and Congress is debating another round of PPP in next stimulus bill, though negotiations with the Trump administration are currently stalled.
Of the total $2.6 trillion in relief measures approved by Congress since the start of the pandemic, the GAO said that as of June 30, $1.5 trillion had been committed, with $1.3 trillion of that spent.
That includes money appropriated for supplemental unemployment insurance and public health and social services emergency spending.

Rising weekly wages can be a sign that employers are scrambling to find workers and boosting pay to attract them, but in the current economy they are ""false signals,"" Daly and her staff wrote in the regional Fed bank's latest Economic Letter on Monday. 
Low-wage workers have lost their jobs at much higher rates than better-paid ones during the coronavirus pandemic, leaving only the latter to be counted in gauges of wage growth, the new research showed. That distorted readings of wage growth upward by several percentage points, they said.
""Therefore, high wage growth captured in aggregate measures should not be seen as indicative of a recovering or a strong labor market,"" according to the research https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2020/august/illusion-of-wage-growth, which parsed the second quarter's more than 10% rise in average weekly pay. 
Under a new monetary policy framework unveiled last week, the U.S. central bank has pledged to address ""shortfalls"" from the ""broad-based and inclusive goal"" of full employment. 
But Daly's research, and remarks from Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida earlier on Monday, suggest the Fed will not be leaning on its usual guideposts for measuring the strength of the labor market and for setting interest rates. 
A falling unemployment rate by itself won't trigger tighter monetary policy unless inflation surges or financial instability threatens, Clarida told the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
The new research by Daly and her staff suggests that wage increases by themselves won't be a trigger either.

""In the wake of the virus, evaluations of the labor market must rely on a dashboard of indicators, rather than any single measure, to paint a complete picture of the losses and the recovery,"" Daly and her staff wrote.

Asked about the need for the Fed to up its pace of bond purchases, Bostic said ""foremost this is a public health crisis and I think distracting from that reality could get us to a place where we are focusing on the wrong thing.""

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The World Bank has estimated that a huge explosion at Beirut port caused as much as $4.6 billion in damage to homes and infrastructure, and the bank's regional head said this should be a catalyst for reforms to unlock reconstruction funds.
Lebanon has regularly turned to the international community for help during its slow reconstruction since a 1975-1990 civil war but its failure to reform a system blighted by corruption and mismanagement has often deterred donors and investors.
""This time around, the shock is so big, it is such a self-inflicted wound ... that I really hope and believe there will be a wake-up call,"" World Bank Vice President for Middle East and North Africa Ferid Belhaj told Reuters.
He was speaking after the release of the bank's Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment report on the Aug. 4 blast that shattered a swathe of Beirut, much of it an area that had already been rebuilt once following the civil war.
The World Bank report on the blast, blamed on a massive amount of ammonium nitrate stored poorly at the port, estimated physical damage at $3.8 billion to $4.6 billion.
Other losses, such as the knock to economic output, ranged from $2.9 billion to $3.5 billion, it said.
Lebanon, already crushed by a mountain of debt, has appealed to the international community for help.
Donors, led by French President Emmanuel Macron who is visiting Beirut this week for the second time in a month, have demanded a new government tackle endemic state corruption and implement other reforms to secure support.
Belhaj blamed ""basic mismanagement"" for the blast and economic crisis ravaging the economy even before the explosion.
He said Lebanon would have to attract foreign state aid and private investment to recover but that the global coronavirus crisis had made the task more challenging.
""The Lebanese need to wake up to the cruel reality that it is not like money is waiting to be spent on the country,"" he said. The government needed to show more transparency, make sure the judiciary functioned properly and improve governance.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's economy shrank by nearly a quarter in April-June, much more than forecast and pointing to a longer than previously expected recovery with analysts calling for further stimulus.
Consumer spending, private investments and exports all collapsed during the world's strictest lockdown imposed in late March to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and India - the world's fastest-growing large economy until a few years ago - now looks to be headed for its first full-year contraction since 1980.
Gross domestic product shrank by a record 23.9% in April-June from a year earlier, official data showed on Monday, against a Reuters poll forecast for an 18.3% contraction.
Krishnamurthy Subramanian, chief economist at the Ministry of Finance, said India's economy was set for a ""V-shaped"" recovery and should perform better in the coming quarters as indicated by a pickup in rail freight, power consumption and tax collections.
Some private economists, however, said the fiscal year that began in April could see a contraction of nearly 10%, the worst performance since India won independence from British colonial rule in 1947, and likely to push millions more into poverty.
""Given the limited fiscal space and the need to stimulate a more durable growth, the growth recovery will be gradual and is likely to continue into 1H FY22,"" said Suvodeep Rakshit, senior economist at Kotak Institutional Equities, Mumbai.
Consumer spending - the main driver of the economy - dropped 31.2% year-on-year in April-June compared to a 2.6% fall in the previous quarter, data showed, while capital investments were down 47.9% compared to a 2.1% rise in the previous quarter.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a $266 billion stimulus package in May, including credit guarantees on bank loans and free food grains for poor people, but consumer demand and manufacturing have yet to recover.
The Reserve Bank of India, which has reduced the benchmark repo rate  by a total of 115 basis points since February, is expected to cut interest rates to boost growth after keeping them on hold this month amid rising inflation.
VIRUS CASES ON RISE
The coronavirus has been spreading in India faster than anywhere else in the world, with more than 3.6 million people already infected and a death toll of over 64,400.
Continuing restrictions on transport, educational institutions and restaurants have hit manufacturing, services and retail sales, while keeping millions of workers out of jobs.
Manufacturing has already entered recession as output fell 39.3% in April-June after falling 1.4% in the previous quarter, and construction and trade services plunged by around 50%.
With an annual growth of 3.4% in the April-June quarter, the farm sector, which accounts for 15% of economic output, offered some hope the rural economy will be able to support millions of migrant workers who have returned to their villages.
Still, Rupa Rege Nitsure, group chief economist at L&T Financial Holdings, said the government will have to take more steps to boost the economy overall.
""Unless the central and state governments focus on re-starting the economic machine completely, the real process of repair and reconstruction will not gain momentum,"" she said.

820,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 11:40AM ET</span>","Fed to resume discussion of next policy steps, Clarida says","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With a new policy framework in place, the Federal Reserve will turn to debating possible next steps in the U.S. central bank's fight against the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Monday.
That discussion is expected to include possible promises by the Fed to link interest rate decisions directly to a return to full employment, and the possible expansion of its monthly asset purchases to further boost the economy. 
""Now that we have concluded the review, I imagine we will be returning to a discussion of potentially refining guidance and our balance sheet communication, but I don’t want to prejudge where that would end up,"" Clarida said during an event organized by the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. 
The Fed last week said it was shifting its strategy to allow higher inflation to offset periods of weak price increases in hopes of letting job markets tighten, wages rise, and workers gain more of the benefits from economic expansions.
Analysts have said the new strategy lacks details and begs the question of what the Fed will do to support its new approach - and in particular when the central bank might announce expected increases in its bond purchases or flesh out the time period used to assess ""average"" inflation.
Clarida said that latter decision may wait until the economy recovers more.
""I would expect as the economy recovers and as we approach our dual mandate goals there will be further communication,"" about the Fed's plans, Clarida said in a question-and-answer session after he spoke via a webcast at Monday's event.
FED'S WORK NOT DONE
In his prepared remarks, Clarida focused on the fact that the Fed's new approach to monetary policy means a low unemployment rate on its own doesn't warrant higher interest rates, a ""robust"" change meant to acknowledge the economy is different than that of textbook models.
""A low unemployment rate by itself, in the absence of evidence that price inflation is running or is likely to run persistently above mandate-consistent levels or pressing financial stability concerns, will not, under our new framework, be a sufficient trigger for policy action,"" Clarida said.
""Econometric models,"" particularly those including a necessary trade-off with falling unemployment leading to higher inflation, ""can be and have been wrong ... A decision to tighten monetary policy based solely on a model ... is difficult to justify.""
Clarida's comments, describing the new policy as a ""milestone,"" said the new approach was justified because emerging research showed the economy has changed so much since 2012. Keeping the same approach as the Fed has used in the interim risked embedding inflation below its 2% target into market and household decision-making - and putting the United States on the same weak growth path as Japan, for example.
""If policy seeks only to return inflation to 2% following a downturn,"" Clarida said, the previous approach ""will tend to generate inflation that averages less than 2%."" That, in turn, means the Fed's policy interest rates would be lower than they would be otherwise, and downturns risked being longer with higher unemployment.
The new policy aims to use periods of higher inflation to specifically offset periods of weakness.

The central bank's work, Clarida indicated, isn't done. Now that the long-run policy document is set, the Fed will begin studying changes to its Summary of Economic Projections, the ""dot plot"" of policymaker forecasts, which may be the vehicle to flesh out issues like how long an averaging period the Fed will use.

821,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 10:40AM ET</span>","Argentina debt deal set for high creditor support, few holdouts","BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's debt restructuring deal is set to have received huge creditor support when the government unveils the results of the tender on Monday, though there are question marks over two individual bond series that may have fallen short.
The South American country's government is scheduled to present the outcome of the deal at around 4 p.m. (1900 GMT) after months of tense negotiations, pushed deadlines and modifications to its offer helped strike an agreement with most creditors.
Reuters reported on Friday, when the deal deadline closed, that the government was confident of high creditor support for the deal.
A strong deal is key for Argentina, Latin America's No. 3 economy and a major grains producer, to drag itself out of default and revive an economy that is in its third year of recession and expected to contract around 12.5% this year.
""We told Argentines that we would seek a debt settlement that does not hit those who suffer the most. And we are succeeding,"" President Alberto Fernandez wrote in a post on Twitter.
""We are doing what we said we were going to do. Now, united, we are going to rebuild Argentina.""
The possibility that collective action clauses (CACs) may not be reached on some bonds raises the possibility of holdouts, though those are not expected to account for a significant portion of the overall debt pile or affect the wider deal.
The bonds being restructured have CACs that mean the government needs a certain level of support to restructure them. The older 2005 indenture bonds require a higher combined 85% of creditor support, with two-thirds on each individual series.
The anticipated strong support and few likely holdouts would stand in contrast to Argentina's 2005 debt restructuring, which saw creditors holding around a quarter of bonds reject a deal, leading to over a decade of legal battles.
Roberto Geretto, economist at Banco CMF, said that a high participation level was basically assured, and that the only doubt was if all the 2005 bonds would reach the thresholds.
""In case the CACs cannot be executed on these bonds, there are two options: after a reallocation process some series of bonds may remain as holdouts, or become performing again if the government pays the unpaid interest,"" he said.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's annual consumer price inflation is expected to climb towards 12% in August, a Reuters poll showed on Monday, pushed up by higher energy prices and the weak lira.
The median estimate in a Reuters poll of 14 economists for annual inflation in August stood at 11.91%, with forecasts ranging between 11.40% and 12.37%. Inflation was 11.76% in July.
Monthly inflation was expected to be 1%, with estimates between 0.56% and 1.41%.
""Despite the favourable base year impact, higher energy prices as well as the FX pass-through impact, especially on core good prices, will carry the annual inflation close to 12%,"" said Ozlem Bayraktar Goksen, chief economist at Tacirler Yatirim.
""VAT cuts on some services (especially on hotels and restaurants prices) are considered to have a downward effect... However, the prevailing depreciation in the lira would increase the pressure on the core goods prices in August.""
The Turkish currency , which hit a series of record lows against U.S. dollar in August, has shed 19% of its value so far this year.
The Turkish central bank ended a run of rate cuts in June and has held its policy rate at 8.25% since then, citing some uptick in prices. It raised its year-end inflation forecast to 8.9% a month ago, but said inflation will enter a falling trend beginning in July.
For year end, the poll's median inflation estimate of 10 economists was 11%, compared to 10% in the July poll.
Annual inflation fell to 11.76% in July, reversing two months of rising inflation as the economy continued to emerge from lockdown.
On Sunday, Turkey increased its special consumption tax on mid-range and expensive cars, a move which economists said could lift year-end inflation by up to 1%.

The Turkish Statistical Institute is expected to announce August inflation data on Thursday, Sept 3 at 0700 GMT.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A mix of economic contraction and subdued inflationary risks will allow Russia to cut interest rates again this year, paving the way for a stronger rouble and an economic recovery in 2021, a poll of economists and analysts showed on Monday.
Russia took a hit from lower oil prices and the global coronavirus pandemic, which led to lockdowns that sparked a full-scale economic crisis, prompting the central bank to slash rates.
Russian markets have also come under pressure this month in the wake of the political crisis in neighbouring Belarus as well as over the suspected poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
The consensus forecast of 21 analysts and economists suggested the central bank may lower its benchmark rate to 4% as soon as September although it may also opt to keep the rate at 4.25%.
""Increased volatility on the debt and currency market raises the probability that the Bank of Russia will take a pause at the Sept. 18 rate meeting,"" said Kirill Sokolov, chief economist at Sovcombank.
""If the geopolitical background stabilises, the Bank of Russia may lower the key rate by 25 bps to 4%.""
The poll suggested that the key rate would then stay at 4% through 2021.
Inflation is seen finishing this year at 3.7%, the same as in the late-July poll.
The main impact of rate cuts will take several months to show, but should help the economy recover in the future.
In 2020, the oil-dependent economy will contract by 4.7% before returning to growth in the second quarter of 2021. In the whole of 2021, the economy will grow 3.2%, the poll showed. The previous monthly poll predicted a 4.3% contraction this year and 2.7% growth next year.
Most of the forecasts in the Reuters poll were based on at least 10 individual projections.
The rouble outlook against the euro worsened slightly and was largely unchanged versus the dollar but the currency was still expected to firm up from current levels.
""We believe that in the next 1-2 weeks the rouble will return to 72-74 versus the dollar,"" BCS Brokerage said, keeping its year-end forecast at 69.6.
The poll showed the rouble was expected to trade at 70.33 to the dollar and 82.73 to the euro 12 months from now. The previous poll foresaw exchange rates of 70.50 and 81.67, respectively.

On Monday, the rouble's official exchange rates, set by the central bank, were 74.64 per dollar and 88.74 per euro.

“Yield caps and targets were not warranted in the current environment but should remain an option that the committee could reassess in the future if circumstances changed markedly,” Clarida said in the text of remarks Monday for an online event hosted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
Clarida also said policy makers might offer “refinements” to their Summary of Economic Projections -- a quarterly document that outlines their economic outlook and projections for rates -- in light of the framework changes announced last week by Fed Chair Jerome Powell.
“Now that we have ratified our new statement, the committee can assess possible refinements to our SEP with the aim of reaching a decision on any potential changes by the end of this year,” he said.
Clarida’s remarks follow Powell’s announcement that the U.S. central bank will sometimes allow inflation to run above its 2% objective to make up for prior undershoots, and allow unemployment to run lower than officials had previously tolerated. The shift is aimed at boosting inflation after years of falling short of the Fed’s target, an outcome that hurts the central bank’s ability to fight recessions.
Fed policy makers next meet Sept. 15-16, when they’ll have a chance to spell out how the new long-term strategy will shape their near-term policies aimed at pulling the U.S. economy out of its sharpest downturn since the Great Depression. Central bankers will also release their latest Summary of Economic Projections.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has no reason for now to add to its stimulus measures as disruptions related to the recent surge in coronavirus infections were already factored into its policy, ECB board member Isabel Schnabel told Reuters.
With case numbers inching towards their early-year highs, some European nations are once again imposing restrictions on business and travel, raising expectations that the ECB would be forced to expand its already lavish, 1.35 trillion euro ($1.6 trillion) emergency bond scheme, to help governments cope.
But Schnabel appeared to soften those expectations and she even played down concerns over the euro's recent strength, which some analysts fear could automatically negate some of the ECB's stimulus effort.
""We are seeing a certain resurgence of infections, but at the moment it looks unlikely that we are going to see a full lockdown again,"" the head of the ECB's market operations said in an interview. ""This is precisely what we assumed in our baseline scenario in June.""
""If you look at incoming data, by and large they support the baseline... (and) as long as the baseline remains intact, there is no reason to adjust the monetary policy stance,"" Schnabel added, including the size of its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, or PEPP.
As the euro zone economy went into freefall over the spring, the ECB acted early, buying record amounts of debt to keep borrowing costs down and giving banks more than 1 trillion euros worth of loans at negative interest rates. 
For the transcript of Schnabel's remarks, click on:
ECB IS NOT THE FED
With markets stabilising over the summer, pressure has also decreased on the ECB to skew bond purchases towards more indebted countries, as it did earlier this year when it overbought Italian debt, deviating from its so-called ""capital key"", which reflects each country's shareholding in the bank.
""As the risk of fragmentation is going down, there is less of a need to deviate from the capital key,"" said Schnabel, a university professor until she joined the ECB this year.
Although the ECB is open to buying into the European Union's first joint debt issuance, even this new bond was insufficient justification to increase its asset purchases as the ECB is driven by policy goals, not the market supply of debt.
Schnabel also played down concern that the U.S. Federal Reserve's shift to average inflation targeting could weaken the dollar further as it suggests a shallower rate path. 
The euro has already firmed 4% this year on a trade-weighted bases, mostly on the dollar's decline, dampening profits from exports and weighing on imported inflation.
""I am not worrying too much about exchange rate developments,"" Schnabel said. ""If there is a depreciation of the U.S. dollar, this tends to boost global trade and global growth,"" she said, arguing that this could compensate euro zone firms.
Much like the Fed, the ECB is conducting a broad policy review but Schnabel warned against drawing too many parallels, arguing that ""what is best for the Fed is not necessarily the best for the ECB,"" even if there is interdependence between the two.
She said the ECB's own inflation aim is also up for debate but the target needs to maintain its medium-term perspective and should be simple enough so it can be easily communicated.
The ECB currently aims for an inflation rate of below but close to 2%, something it has undershot for over seven years, prompting some soul-searching at the central bank.
The ECB will next meet on Sept. 10, when it will also publish updated projections, and while policymakers had hoped to meet in person, Schnabel said ""this may have to be revised"".

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic demonstrates in the clearest terms why central banks must take a bigger role in fighting climate change even if the issue at first appears unrelated to monetary policy, European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel said.
Initially just a health crisis, the pandemic has set off economic shockwaves around the globe, affecting every nation and forcing central banks to provide unprecedented support to underpin economic activity.
With climate change posing an even bigger risk, the ECB must keep this issue high on its agenda as it reviews its policy framework, Schnabel told Reuters in an interview. 
""Climate change is probably the biggest challenge we are facing, much bigger than the pandemic,"" Schnabel said. 
""Even though this health shock was entirely unrelated to monetary policy, it nevertheless has huge implications for monetary policy,"" she said. ""The same is true for climate change and this is why central banks cannot ignore it.""
Through its supervisory arm the ECB could require banks to provide a climate risk assessment, which could then affect their access to central bank funding if this assessment has a direct implication on collateral valuations, Schnabel said.
The central bank should also push the European Union to add a green element to its long-delayed project to set up a capital markets union as a focus on green finance could give the bloc a competitive advantage, she argued.
Schnabel, who in the past has expressed scepticism about skewing ECB bond purchases towards green bonds, added that her view on the topic was still ""developing"".
""There is the view that we should stick very closely to market neutrality,"" she said. ""And there is the alternative view that markets are not pricing climate risks properly, so there is a market distortion and therefore market neutrality may not actually be the right benchmark."" 
Already one of the biggest buyers of green assets, the ECB holds around 20% of the green bonds that are eligible for its purchases, leaving little scope for more buys under its current rules.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Lisa Krohn's Ashanti Lodge in Cape Town - normally abuzz with backpackers from around the world - today sits largely empty, a sign of how the pandemic has crushed South Africa's tourist industry.
""This place is like a morgue,"" she said, contemplating the Victorian-era building's deserted foyer.
Following a five-month lockdown, South Africa is easing domestic travel restrictions, allowing hotels to reopen. With international borders still closed, the government is pinning its hopes on domestic tourism, echoing a strategy being tried from Vietnam to New Zealand with mixed results.
South Africa remains among the countries hardest hit by the pandemic however. And with recession-battered consumers watching their pocketbooks, many in the sector foresee an uphill battle. 
""When your tourism industry is all geared toward international tourism, domestic tourism will not compensate,"" said Olivier Ponti, vice-president at ForwardKeys, which studies global travel trends. ""It's just impossible.""
Abundant wildlife, stunning scenery and renowned vineyards have made South Africa one of the world's big long-haul travel destinations, establishing tourism as a pillar of the economy. 
Last year, it welcomed over 10 million international visitors. SA Tourism, the sector's marketing agency, was targeting 8.7% year-on-year growth in inbound arrivals in 2020 with total tourist spending projected to reach 273 billion rand ($16 billion).
But COVID-19 brought the sector to a screeching halt as governments closed borders and imposed lockdowns. 
""It isn't just a reduction in income, it's been zero income,"" said Lisa Goosen, CEO of Tintswalo, which operates high-end lodges and boutique hotels. 
Of tourism businesses responding to a government survey, 64% were unable to service their debts in May and 67% could not meet fixed costs. Many businesses have laid off staff or slashed wages. Others have gone bust.
SA Tourism says nearly 440,000 tourism jobs are at risk this year. The sector is expected to lose 75% of projected revenues and 80 billion rand in foreign receipts. 
A LOST SEASON?
With South Africans now permitted to travel between provinces for the first time since March, tourist-focused businesses are pivoting to domestic customers to stay afloat. 
To keep the lights on, Krohn's Ashanti Lodge had begun renting rooms long-term to locals needing cheap accommodation. Now, hotels and guesthouses like hers are rushing to put together ""city break"" offers. 
Tintswalo has slashed prices 50% for ""staycation"" deals at properties like its five-star hotels in Cape Town and luxury safari lodges previously frequented by Americans and Europeans. 
Restaurants on the city's waterfront are recalling furloughed staff. Game reserves are preparing campsites.
Authorities says travel by South Africans will be key to relaunching the sector, starting with outings close to home then broader domestic tourism. 
""Strong domestic demand will be critical to performance in the second half of 2020,"" SA Tourism wrote in a recently published recovery plan. 
In an early indication of pent-up demand, ForwardKeys analysts saw a 60% surge in domestic flight searches as the government loosened travel restrictions. 
But those volumes are still down 80% from the same period last year, and current economic woes will likely dampen any domestic travel rebound.
When the pandemic struck, South Africa was already in recession. The economy is projected to shrink by 7.2% this year, and lockdown layoffs have added to a pre-COVID jobless rate of 30%. 
""We are going to have a lot more unemployed people, which means there is going to be a lot less disposable income,"" said Enver Duminy, CEO of Cape Town Tourism. 
Local tourism was already slipping. Domestic trips dropped nearly 14% year-on-year in 2018. And domestic tourists spend much less than foreign visitors. 
""Domestic travelers only are not sustainable to tourism,"" said Tshifhiwa Tshivhengwa, CEO of Tourism Business Council South Africa. ""We need international markets.""
When international visitors will return is anyone's guess. Now is when they would normally book for the November-to-March high season. But it's unclear when South Africa's borders will reopen, and few expect a significant rebound in long-haul leisure travel when they do.
As waves crashed onto the rocks below Chapman's Peak drive, Goosen said she's just glad to finally reopen Tintswalo's hotel there to guests, wherever they're from. 

""I think that the season is lost. But at least we will keep our staff employed.""

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India announced new measures on Monday to maintain stability in the financial system during the coronavirus pandemic, including two more tranches of special open market bond operations in its 'Operation Twist'.
The central bank said it would also raise the ratio of securities that banks can hold until maturity within their statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) or mandatory bond holding requirement, which would help limit losses due to market volatility.
""The RBI remains committed to use all instruments at its command to revive the economy by maintaining congenial financial conditions, mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and restore the economy to a path of sustainable growth while preserving macroeconomic and financial stability,"" the central bank said in a statement.
RBI said it will conduct two more tranches of 100 billion rupees ($1.36 billion) each of simultaneous sale and purchase of bonds in September, or 'Operation Twist' as it is popularly known.
Indian bond yields had risen in recent weeks due to high government borrowing, rising inflation and reduced expectations of interest rate cuts following the release of minutes of the RBI's monetary policy committee's latest meeting.
Some analysts, however, said the RBI's measures did not go far enough.
""It's a band aid for the market but the steps also show RBI doesn't have space for outright OMOs (open market operations),"" said A. Prasanna, chief economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership.
RBI, however, also said there were indications that food and fuel prices were stabilising and the recent rise in the rupee was helping to contain imported inflationary pressures.
The bank said that it will also conduct term repo operations for a total of 1 trillion rupees at the current repo rate in mid-September to assuage pressures from advance tax outflows.
""This move does not take away the problem of supply overhang, the impact of this move in (keeping bond yields in check) will only be temporary,"" said Ashhish Vaidya, Head of Trading and Asset Liability Management at DBS Bank India. 
""What the market requires, due to the bond supply overhang, is some sort of decisive move in terms of OMO purchases, like what the central banks in developed markets have demonstrated.""
RBI said banks would now be allowed to hold up to 22% of their SLR securities under the held-to-maturity category until March 31, 2021, up from the current limit of 19.5%.

830,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>","Brazil's fiscal fragility stokes funding fears, despite record low rates","By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's official interest rates and the average cost of servicing its public debt have never been lower, but investors are becoming worried that the government could face a funding crisis next year. 
The premium that investors demand to lend longer-term to Brazil has risen amid record borrowing and government debt, along with concern that the far-right administration of President Jair Bolsonaro will relax a key fiscal discipline rule to combat the COVID-19 crisis.
That is forcing the Treasury to borrow for much shorter durations, such as six months, reducing the average maturity of Brazil's debt profile and increasing the need to refinance on a more regular basis.
As long as the benchmark Selic interest rate stays low and lenders are willing to accept these historically low returns, the debt situation will be manageable. 
But with the fiscal outlook deteriorating and almost 1 trillion reais ($180 bln) of public debt maturing next year, nerves are fraying. This prompted official approval last week for the central bank to transfer 325 billion reais to the Treasury to help ease the strain.
""When you shorten the debt profile, you raise the risk of refinancing in the future. You force yourself to issue bigger volumes, and risk being forced to issue at any price,"" said Sergio Goldenstein, former head of open market operations at the central bank. ""This is a really risky debt management approach.""
MATURITIES SHORTENING 
Brazil's Treasury on Friday raised its 2020 ceiling for the federal public debt to 4.9 trillion reais and revised the profile of its debt stock to reflect the economic crisis and market volatility this year.
The share of short-term debt maturing in the next year will be increased to as much as 28% of the total, and the average maturity of the overall debt stock will be as low as 3.5 years.
As the Treasury chart below shows, the average maturity of the domestic debt stock ticked up slightly in July but was still a historically low 3.75 years, while the average maturity of new debt issued in July was barely 3 years.
Graphic: Brazil debt profile - July - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvzmknwpw/DEBTPROFILEJULY.png
Jose Franco, sub-secretary for public debt at the Treasury, said that short-term financing risk was the main reason behind the central bank-Treasury transfer. He also pointed to widening spreads between the benchmark Selic and longer-term yields.
Graphic: Brazil Selic-5 year spread - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvzmkmmpw/Selic5yspread.png
Like other countries, Brazil needs to borrow so heavily because of the economic crisis triggered by COVID-19. The government's budget deficit is on course to reach 11% of gross domestic product, swelling overall debt to around 95% of GDP. 
These are developed economy levels of indebtedness. The Latin American & Caribbean median this year, according to Fitch Ratings, will be 4.3% and 58.8% of GDP, respectively.
Tony Volpon, chief Brazil economist at UBS and former central bank director, said the central bank-Treasury transfer was likely fully priced in by financial markets and may not fully allay market fears over the financing cliff ahead.
""Is there a liquidity crunch? Like most things, that is not black or white. It is in the eye of the beholder,"" Volpon said. ""But the Treasury's financing need is so large, there is a limit on how much floating rate notes can be issued,"" he said.
While the central bank has made clear it does not intend to raise rates for some time, that could change if the government fails to get public finances back on a more sustainable path. 
'GAME OVER'
So far, at least, the mostly domestic investors who buy the debt seem willing to lend on these terms. On Aug. 13 the Treasury sold 30 billion reais of six-month fixed rate bills at an average rate of 2.08%. It was by far the biggest-ever sale of six-month debt since comparable records began over 20 years ago.
More than 20% of Brazil's entire public debt is due to be refinanced next year. 
The Treasury's Franco would not be drawn on exact figures, but said the central bank transfer means the liquidity cushion covers more than three months' funding needs. He also said the extra cash does not mean less issuance in the future.
But Drausio Giacomelli, head of emerging market strategy at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in New York, noted that the Treasury has reduced year-to-date net issuance by around 8% because market conditions have deteriorated, and it does not want to risk a failed debt auction which would push yields sharply higher.
He argues the only way to allay these concerns is for the government to stick to its rule limiting increases in public spending to the rate of inflation, and show a credible long-term commitment to bringing down the public debt.
""Will people want to fund the government if the spending cap is broken and spending is not brought under control?"" he asked. ""If you don't have primary surplus, lenders may say we are not funding you any more. Then the game is over.""

831,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",Jump in 30-year Treasury yield raises expectations of Fed purchases,"By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are raising expectations the Federal Reserve will act to tame an upturn in yields by expanding its purchases of long-dated Treasury bonds, after the U.S. central bank said it would allow inflation to run higher. 
Yields on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds (US30YT=RR) hit a two-month high on Friday. Rising yields are a potential problem for the Fed as they raise the cost of borrowing for companies and individuals and threaten economic growth. 
Some investors said the central bank may need to address the possibility of buying longer-dated debt at its mid-September policy meeting, if not sooner. Investors had previously expected the Fed to introduce the policy by the end of the year.
""The Fed cannot afford to have long rates go up significantly because it would undo everything they have been doing for the past six months,"" said Gershon Distenfeld, co-head of fixed income at AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB).
The Fed has purchased nearly $2 trillion in Treasury debt since the start of the coronavirus pandemic - bringing its current holdings to roughly $4.36 trillion - in order to keep interest rates low and maintain market liquidity. The majority of those purchases have been in shorter-dated notes. 
(Graphic: The Fed's Treasury holdings by maturity, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmvjnbbmvr/Fed%20balance%20sheet.png) 
The yield on 30-year Treasuries is particularly sensitive to inflation expectations as a bond's value can be eroded by rising consumer prices over time. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell rolled out a sweeping rewrite of the central bank's monetary policy on Thursday which prioritized strengthening the U.S. labor market and put less weight on concerns about inflation rising too high.
The 30-year yield jumped 9.4 basis points on Thursday, and then jumped another 7.7 basis points on Friday to 1.577%, the highest since June 16. It had pared some of those gains late Friday afternoon.
Some investors believe yields would have to move higher for the Fed to expand its purchases.
""I don't think we're there yet. But I would expect this to become an increasing component of the conversation. I would expect at the next FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting someone will bring up the idea,"" said Jon Hill, U.S. rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets.

The Fed has used this tactic before. In the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession, the Fed employed Operation Twist, an initiative that involved selling short-dated notes and buying long-dated bonds. Because interest rates were already near zero, the Fed bought long-dated bonds to tamp down yields and thereby stimulate growth and encourage borrowing.

833,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 06:27AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday, August 31","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- China gums up President Trump's efforts to make TikTok American. New data show both the Chinese and Japanese economy doing better than expected as Warren Buffett makes a $6 billion bet on Japan's big commodity trading houses. And FDA head Steve Hahn defends his agency's approach to authorizing treatments for Covid-19. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, August 31st.
1. China throws a wrench into the TikTok deal 
The sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations has been complicated by new Chinese regulations restricting the export of artificial intelligence technology.
The regulations appear to give Beijing an effective veto on the deal and turn the tables on the U.S., which has clamped down on Chinese investment in the country in recent years citing the risks of sensitive technology transfers.
Various reports had suggested that a deal would be agreed at the weekend to sell the operations to a U.S. buyer. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and even Walmart (NYSE:WMT) had been linked with the deal.
2. China's domestic economy strengthens, but bank results point to problems
The yuan strengthened against the dollar to its highest in 15 months after an official business survey came in surprisingly strong.
The official purchasing managers index for August rose to 54.5 from 54.1 in July, thanks largely to agriculture and services – the more domestically-focused pillar of the Chinese economy. The survey suggests that domestic demand is starting to catch up with the recovery in industrial production since March.
However, the pandemic has still left its scars on the Chinese economy: the country’s largest banks reported their biggest quarterly drop in profits in a decade, thanks to a rise in bad loans and tighter lending spreads.
3. Stocks set to open higher; Clarida, Bostic speeches eyed.
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher as the ongoing ‘melt-up’ refuses to lose momentum, having been seemingly underwritten by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech last Thursday.
By 6:25 AM ET (1025 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 42 points or 0.2%, while S&P 500 Futures were up 0.2% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.4%.
On a generally light day for data, participants are likely to pay heed to Fed vice-chairman Richard Clarida, whose speech at 9 AM ET (1300 GMT) will flesh out the finer points of the Fed’s shift to ‘average inflation targeting’. The shift has been broadly interpreted as locking in near-zero interest rates for as much as five years.
Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic is also due to speak at 10:30 AM ET.  The Dallas Fed’s monthly business survey is due out at the same time.
4. Buffett bets on Japanese trading houses
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) placed a $6 billion bet on a handful of the big commodity trading houses in Japan, in the latest surprising instalment of a hunt for yield worldwide.
Berkshire said at the weekend it had taken stakes of around 5% in Itochu. (T:8001), Marubeni (T:8002), Sumitomo (T:8053), Mitsui. (T:8031) and Mitsubishi (T:8058)  companies that have dominated the process of feeding Japan’s manufacturing sector with raw materials for decades.
The move comes after a net outflow of foreign money from Japanese equities that has run to $132 billion over the last two and a half years, suggesting that Buffett is calling time on that particular trend.
Overnight, official data showed Japanese data showed industrial production rose 8.0% in July, well ahead of expectations. The Ministry of Trade and Industry expects the rebound to flatten out over the next two months, however.
5. FDA head Hahn walks the tightrope
Food and Drug Administration head Steve Hahn said he’s open to fast-tracking authorization for drugs treating Covid-19 but only if the benefits to public health outweigh the risks.
Hahn’s comments, made in an interview with the Financial Times, come a week after President Donald Trump accused the FDA of delaying drug authorizations in order to hurt his chances of re-election in November.
“It is up to the sponsor [vaccine developer] to apply for authorization or approval, and we make an adjudication of their application,” Hahn told the FT. “If they do that before the end of Phase Three, we may find that appropriate. We may find that inappropriate, we will make a determination.”
He pledged that any decision taken by the FDA would be “a science, medicine, data decision. This is not going to be a political decision.”"

Reuters asked the experts,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's decision to step down on Friday because of worsening health will formally put an end to his ""Abenomics"" strategy, which tried to revive the world's third-largest economy after decades of stagnation.
So how does Abenomics stack up? 
Reuters surveyed 18 experts to gauge their perceptions of Abe on five areas: ending deflation; fiscal reform; labour-market reform; encouraging business and investment; and deregulation.
Respondents were asked to rate each topic with ""achieved"", ""partially achieved"" or ""failed"". Below are some highlights from their comments, gathered before Abe announced his resignation.
1/ENDING DEFLATION
Q: How do you rate Abe's attempt to reflate the economy, create jobs and end deflation?
MARC OSTWALD, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ADM INVESTOR SERVICES
FAILED
""Outside of a tighter labour market, but with no real impact on wages, the economy is way short of that 600 trillion yen (GDP) target and inflation continues to hover near zero."" 
RICHARD JERRAM, CHIEF ECONOMIST, TOP DOWN MACRO
ACHIEVED
""Before COVID-19 hit, Japan had enjoyed several years of strikingly tight labour markets and solid growth (for Japan). Inflation had edged into positive territory, while well below the BOJ's 2% target, but other developed economies have seen a similar difficulty in raising inflation despite solid growth, so we should not view Japan's recent record too harshly.""
MASAKI TAKETSUME, FUND MANAGER, SCHRODERS TOKYO FUND
PARTIALLY ACHIEVED
""Japan has been through a long period of deflation, but because of Abenomics the Japanese economy has gotten out of deflation to a very low but still an inflationary environment
""At the same time, for the BoJ the offshoot target for inflation is the same as in other countries - which is 2% - and the current level of inflation is far short of that target.""
2/FISCAL REFORM
Q: How successful was Abe in fixing Japan's finances and reining in public debt?
BRIAN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, ASIAN CENTURY QUEST
ACHIEVED
""While the current COVID situation has shredded Japan's fiscal situation like so many other countries, I would agree with the notion that he has largely accomplished what he set out to do – raising consumption taxes while keeping corporate taxes shielded from higher nominal rates. 
""This policy, which has continued in various forms for decades, ensures that domestic consumption will remain stagnant.""
PAUL SHEARD, RESEARCH FELLOW, HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL
FAILED
""The flaw in Abenomics was the reflationary policy shift at the BOJ, for which PM Abe gets full marks, would establish the necessary conditions for the Abe administration to push ahead with the plan to double the consumption tax rate... The problem was that this fiscal tightening was inimical to the reflation objective.""
""Prime Minister Abe should have delayed hiking the consumption tax (to 8%, let alone to the eventual 10%) until at least the BOJ had achieved its, and the government's, aim of sustained 2% CPI inflation."" 
STEVEN VOGEL, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY
PARTIALLY ACHIEVED
""The government was right to favour recovery over fiscal balance. Hence it made sense to move to fiscal expansion, but it pulled back too soon.""
3/LABOUR REFORM
Q: How do you rate Abe's ability to push through reforms to boost productivity and generate sustainable wage growth?
JOSHUA HAUSMAN, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
PARTIALLY ACHIEVED
""The large increase in female labour force participation was a significant policy success."" 
ERIC STEIN, CO-DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL FIXED INCOME, EATON VANCE (Comments reflect pre-COVID environment)
ACHIEVED
""They've gotten a fair amount done. The latest statistics I've seen (show) female labour participation is up pretty significantly. My sense is that the labour market is getting reformed. Some of the rigidities in the labour market are improved. 
""I'd say achieved but still more work to go.""
SAMUEL TOMBS, CHIEF U.K. ECONOMIST, PANTHEON MACROECONOMICS
FAILED
""Structural reform, or the third arrow, has been the declaring failure of Abenomics. Even the government's signature immigration reform last year was much ado about nothing, in practice.""
STEVE COCHRANE, CHIEF APAC ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS
PARTIALLY ACHIEVED
""Efforts have been made. Women's share of the workforce has increased and the government has worked to ensure day-care is available for children to allow women with young children to enter the workforce. Some industries have been opened up to foreign labour, but not all.
""More importantly, a rising share of workers are hired on a part-time basis without traditional paths to advancement and career development. The liberalisation of the labour market still has a long way to go solve the problem of a shrinking labour pool.""
4/BUSINESS & INVESTMENT
Q: How successful was Abe in making Japan a more attractive place to invest and visit?
ULRIKE SCHAEDE, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO
ACHIEVED
""Excellent. The corporate governance reforms, combined with the stewardship code, have made Japan's system – on paper – as good or better than that in the EU or U.S. Of course it is not perfect in reality, and there are always scandal cases, but that is true for all systems. 
""If you look at the numbers... you see that 50% of Japanese shares traded at the TSE are now held by foreigners and institutional investors. Moreover, in the period of 2017-2019, Japan has attracted more private equity investments than any other country, and Japan's M&A activities are second after the U.S.""
BRIAN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, ASIAN CENTURY QUEST
FAILED
""Japan as a market remains unattractive for obvious demographic reasons, including the oft-cited labour rigidities. Japan's tax rates are uncompetitive with neighbouring countries, hands down, as they pertain to the services industry.
""The efforts regarding (corporate governance) and stewardship were sincere and indeed commendable, but like so many such efforts over the decades there is little enforcement and virtually no penalties for non-compliance.""
VALENTIJN VAN NIEUWENHUIJZEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER,  NN  (NASDAQ:NNBR) INVESTMENT PARTNERS
PARTIALLY ACHIEVED
""Changes in corporate governance through the unwinding of many cross-shareholdings and tearing down walls that protect companies from activist shareholders are steps in the right direction and are making companies more independent and profitable.
""However, many of these aspects are embedded in (Japan's) corporate culture and take time to change. But we are slowly but surely seeing the effects of this with improving overall profitability. This makes the equity market more attractive to invest in.""    
5/DEREGULATION
Q: How much success did Abe have in removing barriers hampering innovation in health care, energy, agriculture and other industries?
KOTARO TAMURA, ASIA FELLOW, MILKEN INSTITUTE
ACHIEVED
""Abenomics created preferential tax treatment for angel investors. It promoted investment into promising start-ups by giving a kind of government guarantee. 
""Start-up investments grew at 20% per annum since then. Thanks partially to COVID-19, deregulation in such areas as telework and telemedicine were carried out.""
PETER DIXON, GLOBAL FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, COMMERZBANK AG
PARTIALLY ACHIEVED
""There has been some progress but it is limited so far. I get the sense that politicians continue to talk about it but are struggling to implement it in all the areas necessary.
""It has had some success in areas such as electricity, so it has proven that it can deliver, but the vested interests which prevent big-bang reforms mean that there is a lot still to do and future progress will depend on whether Abe's successor is as reform-minded.""
RAJIV BISWAS, ASIA-PACIFIC CHIEF ECONOMIST, IHS MARKIT
PARTIALLY ACHIEVED
""Japan has made important energy policy reform achievements under Prime Minister Abe, towards reducing carbon emissions in line with global targets under the UN Climate Change Agreement.

835,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>",Damaged WTO now leaderless as chief Azevedo steps down,"By Emma Farge and Philip Blenkinsop
GENEVA/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization's director-general Roberto Azevedo steps down on Monday, leaving the already-damaged global watchdog leaderless as it faces the biggest crisis in its 25-year history.
As the WTO's influence seeps away, rising international tensions and protectionism during a COVID-induced slowdown, most obviously between China and President Donald Trump's U.S. administration, make reform of global trade rules ever more urgent.
""This is indeed a new – though alas not unsurprising – low point for the WTO,"" said Rohinton Medhora, president of the Centre for International Governance Innovation. ""The organisation has been directionless for some time, several years in fact, and will now be functionally leaderless.""
In particular, the WTO appeals court, which rules on international trade disputes, has been paralysed by Washington's blockade on the appointment of new judges. 
Azevedo, a Brazilian, is heading for a job at PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc and eight candidates are vying to replace him.
In 1999, a four-month gap leadership vacuum was widely seen as damaging, and guidelines to prevent a repeat envisaged the 164 members selecting a temporary replacement from among four current deputies. But Washington's insistence on its candidate prevented agreement, leaving a vacuum that will last for months.
U.S. ELECTION
In theory, a winner should be selected by Nov. 7, under an agreed elimination process that seeks to have a new director-general appointed by consensus.
In practice, trade sources say the uncertainty around the presidential election on Nov. 3 in the United States, which has not said publicly which candidate it prefers, could delay matters further. The 2021 budget, due to be set at the end of the year, which Washington might question, could also be a hurdle.
The U.S. administration of President Donald Trump says the WTO, which took almost 20 years to broker its first global agreement, has failed for years to hold China - the world's second largest economy after the United States - accountable for unfair trade practices. It also says the wider WTO tariff system is unfair to the U.S.
Trump has even suggested quitting the WTO, although no firm plans have been announced.
Peter Ungphakorn, a former WTO staff member who now writes blogs on trade, said there was a risk of a similar ""messy selection"" of the next full-time chief, citing trade tensions and members' unwillingness to compromise over the acting director-general.
In theory, day-to-day operations can be handled by the deputies, including the director-general's key role of selecting panellists to adjudicate on trade disputes.
Negotiations to reduce fishing subsidies in particular are supposed to conclude by the end of the year.
But David Tinline, a former adviser to Azevedo, noted that the red-tape-cutting Trade Facilitation Agreement had needed Azevedo's interventions to get over the line in 2013.

""What we are not going to have is that galvanising force of the DG (director-general), pushing people to solve specific problems,"" Tinline said.

837,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 04:18AM ET</span>",Kashkari Says There’s No Urgency for Fed to Update Rate Guidance,"(Bloomberg) -- There isn’t any urgency for the Federal Reserve to offer more clarity on how long it will hold interest rates near zero at the moment because investors already understand the central bank won’t be tightening for a while, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said.
“Market expectations are that rates will be low for a long period of time, and so I don’t feel like there’s a burning pressure that we need to change our forward guidance today to change market expectations,” Kashkari said during an interview on the Bloomberg Odd Lots podcast with Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway, recorded on Aug. 26 and published Monday.
Click here to listen to the interview with Kashkari.
“I think the committee’s already done a good job setting expectations,” he said. “So, I think the work will come and my guess is that we will adopt some more formal form of state-contingent forward guidance, but the committee just hasn’t gotten to that conclusion yet. But I think, I suspect that we’ll get there.”
Fed Chair Jerome Powell used the U.S. central bank’s annual Jackson Hole symposium to announce on Aug. 27 a shift in strategy. Going forward, Fed officials will attempt to guide inflation modestly above their 2% target temporarily following periods of undershooting, in order to average 2% over time.
The change raises the question of whether the Fed will enhance its guidance on the preconditions for any future rate hikes after cutting its benchmark rate to nearly zero at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in March.
‘At Some Point’
According to the minutes of the last meeting of the central bank’s rate-setting committee in July, a number of officials thought such a change would be useful “at some point.” That’s raised expectations among Fed-watchers for an update as soon as the committee’s Sept. 15-16 meeting.
The minutes showed that officials discussed the possibility of new guidance “using thresholds calibrated to inflation outcomes, unemployment rate outcomes, or combinations of the two.” Kashkari said they should focus on inflation in crafting new language.
“More than a year ago, I proposed that the committee adopt a forward guidance that says we will not raise rates until core inflation gets back to 2% on a sustained basis,” he said. “I think forward guidance that is anchored to an outcome of actually achieving our inflation target would be a big step forward relative to where we are today.”
Fed officials spent much of 2019 reviewing their overall approach to policy making after failing to lift inflation to 2% throughout most of the previous decade. The pandemic and growing anger over racial injustice in America have also renewed focus on the central bank’s track record with regard to the labor market, particularly when it comes to minorities.
Democratic politicians including presidential nominee Joe Biden are pushing the Fed to incorporate minority unemployment rates into its interest-rate decisions in a more systematic way. Kashkari cautioned that trying to drive minority unemployment rates too low may not ultimately be compatible with price stability.
“We need to push the labor market as hard as we can until we get to our 2% inflation target, and maybe even a little bit above it if we’re making up for prior misses,” Kashkari said. “But I think that we have to keep our eyes on both ends of that seesaw, and that’s where just targeting, one -- black unemployment, as an example, or Hispanic unemployment -- it may not actually work to balance out both sides of our dual mandate.”

839,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2020 10:20PM ET</span>",Ex-defence minister Ishiba is people's choice for next Japan PM: polls,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Former Japanese Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba is the most popular choice among the public to be the next prime minister, media opinion polls showed, as the race kicks off to succeed Shinzo Abe after his abrupt resignation last week.
Ishiba has about 34% of the public's support, more than double the 14% for Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, the second-most popular choice, a weekend Kyodo News survey showed. 
A Nikkei/TV Tokyo poll showed Ishiba with 28% support, followed by current Defence Minister Taro Kono with 15%. Suga came in fourth place with 11%, the poll showed.
The surveys highlight a split between public opinion and internal Liberal Democratic Party politics. 
Suga - a longtime lieutenant of Abe's in a key supporting role - is expected to get the backing of the faction led by LDP Secretary-General Toshihiro Nikai and of other major factions, local media reported, putting him in a favourable position.
That would make it an uphill battle for Ishiba, a vocal Abe critic who unsuccessfully challenged the out-going premier in the last LDP leadership race in 2018 and is considered less popular within the party.
Another potential candidate, LDP policy chief Fumio Kishida, came in last place in both of the public opinion surveys.
Abe's resignation announcement on Friday, citing the worsening of a chronic illness, set the stage for the party leadership election, which public broadcaster NHK said was likely to place around Sept. 13 to 15. 
The LDP president is virtually assured of being prime minister because of the party's majority in the lower house of parliament.
Brad Glosserman, deputy director of the Center for Rule-Making Strategies at Tama University, said Suga was the safe bet in terms of internal LDP dynamics, but might not be ideal come election time. A general election must be held by late October 2021.

""He doesn't seem to have either the charisma or the vision to push Japan in a new direction. He seems to be the eternal Number Two - he delivers on promises made by his boss,"" said Glosserman.

840,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2020 09:55PM ET</span>",Japan's PM candidate Kishida cautious about cutting sales tax,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Fumio Kishida, a senior Japanese ruling party official seen as among candidates to become next prime minister, on Monday voiced caution over the idea of cutting the sales tax rate to help the economy weather the hit from the coronavirus pandemic.
""The sales tax is a source of revenue to pay for Japan's social welfare burden...,"" Kishida told a television programme, when asked if he opposed cutting it from the current 10% rate.
""Cutting the tax rate would burden small and midsize companies with additional costs"" such as adjusting their cashier systems to adapt to a new tax rate, he said.
The government's decision to raise the sales tax to 10% from 8% in October last year pushed Japan's economy into recession, even before COVID-19 hammered consumption and exports this year.
Kishida said Japan must continue to take fiscal and monetary measures to support the economy, as demand won't bounce back strongly due to the expected prolonged battle with COVID-19.
A group of ruling party lawmakers have recently called on the government to consider cutting the sales tax to cushion the pandemic's blow on households - an idea senior government officials have ruled out so far.
Japan has raised the sales tax twice under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration as part of efforts to rein in the country's huge debt which, at twice the size of its economy, is the biggest among major advanced economies.
Abe's abrupt announcement on Friday that he was stepping down due to health reasons triggers an election in his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to replace him as party president and then a vote in parliament to elect a new prime minister.
A former foreign minister, Kishida has been widely seen as Abe's preferred successor but ranks low in voter surveys. He has told supporters he is in the race.

The stockpile grew by 1.61 billion riyals ($429 million), a rise of around 0.1%, according to a monthly report from the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, the kingdom’s central bank, on Sunday. Reserves in June had fallen to 1.66 trillion riyals, the lowest level since 2010.
Officials attributed a record cumulative decline of more than $47 billion in March and April to a $40 billion transfer from the central bank to the sovereign wealth fund, intended to support investments abroad to take advantage of market turmoil during the coronavirus pandemic.
Saudi Arabia has suffered from a simultaneous decline in oil and non-oil revenue this year as the global pandemic combined with lower energy prices to jolt the kingdom’s public finances. Officials have taken unprecedented measures in response, including tripling value-added tax.
The government could still face a budget deficit of over 13% of gross domestic product in 2020, according to the median of forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.
Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan has said the kingdom will double its borrowing plans this year to soften the impact on the state’s reserves, which it needs to maintain above a certain level to support the kingdom’s currency peg to the dollar.

844,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>","Qatar raises minimum wage, lifts curbs on changing jobs","DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar announced changes to its labour laws on Sunday, raising the minimum wage by 25 percent to 1,000 riyals ($275) a month and scrapping a requirement for workers to get permission from their employers to change jobs.
They are the latest in a series of labour reforms by the 2022 FIFA World Cup host which in the lead up to the tournament has faced accusations that migrant workers are exploited.
The new minimum wage, which comes into effect in six months and is 250 riyals more a month than the old one, is non-discriminatory and applies to all workers. 
Companies must also provide accommodation and food or a combined monthly stipend of 800 riyals.
The removal of employer permission to change jobs is effective immediately. 
“This is a huge step towards our labour reforms,"" labour ministry assistant undersecretary Mohammed Hassan al-Obaidly told Reuters. 
“These reforms are in the best interest of Qatar, its guest workers and employers.""
Companies who do not pay wages or provide adequate accommodation will face harsher penalties under the new reforms, the labour ministry said. 
The United Nation's labour agency hailed the changes, which it said were significant and gave workers more freedom and protection, and employers more choice.
Qatar would be the first in the region with a non-discriminatory minimum wage and the ""kafala"" system was effectively dismantled now that employees would no longer need permission to change jobs, it said. 
The “kafala” sponsorship system is common in Gulf states, where foreign worker visas are linked to the employer. 
Qatar, a country of around 2.7 million people, has only 300,000 citizens of its own. 
Amnesty International said the changes were a significant step in the right direction but that the minimum wage remained relatively low and should be increased. 
""Today’s reforms are a positive step, but there is much still to do,” said Amnesty's Head of Economic and Social Justice, Stephen Cockburn.
Fellow Gulf Arab state the United Arab Emirates on Sunday said it had made changes to its labour law that granted private sector workers paid paternity leave.
It said it was the first Arab country to make such a move.

Investing.com - Stocks on Wall Street rallied on Friday to wrap up another strong week of gains, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average erasing its losses of 2020 thanks to an ongoing flood of stimulus from the Federal Reserve.
 


 
The 30-stock Dow closed 161.60 points higher, or 0.6%, at 28,653.87. Friday’s gains put the index in positive territory for the year, up 0.4% for 2020.
 


 
The S&P 500 gained 0.7% to close at 3,508.01. It was the benchmark index’s first-ever close above 3,500.
 


 
The Nasdaq Composite meanwhile advanced 0.6% to end the day at 11,695.63, also a record close.
 


 
For the week, the Dow advanced 2.6% for its third weekly gain in four weeks. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both notched five-week winning streaks, climbing around 3% each.
 


 
Stocks have rallied sharply in recent months, with all three benchmarks up more than 55% from their lows set on March 23 - when coronavirus-related lockdowns shocked the stock market - as a barrage of stimulus from the Fed and the U.S. government boosted risk appetite.
 


 
The Fed on Thursday unveiled a major policy shift, allowing inflation to run higher to continue to support the economy. The move indicates that interest rates are likely to stay at current level for a long period of time.

846,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 30, 2020 07:14AM ET</span>",Economic Calendar - Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,"By Noreen Burke
Investing.com - Investors will be looking ahead to Friday's U.S. employment report for August for a snapshot of how the labor market recovery from the pandemic is faring. Markets will also be keeping an eye on appearances by top Federal Reserve officials after Chair Jerome Powell last week announced a sweeping policy rewrite that puts more emphasis on bolstering the labor market than controlling inflation. The S&P 500 is on track to post its strongest August in 34 years, while the Dow will have new names in the index from Monday. Economic reports from the euro zone will shed more light on the durability of the bloc’s recovery, while PMI data from China will watched for signs of how the recovery in the world’s second-largest economy is progressing. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
Friday's nonfarm payrolls will be anxiously awaited amid fears that the recovery in the labor market is stalling, with initial jobless claims hovering at around 1 million per week.
The consensus forecast is for the U.S. economy to have added 1.4 million jobs in August, down slightly from 1.76 million in July, while the unemployment rate is expected to tick down to 9.8% from 10.2%.
But some analysts are speculating that the jobs report could be weaker than expected after recent poor consumer confidence data pointed to anxiety over rising Covid cases and worries about job prospects.
Thursday’s report on jobless claims will give a more up-to-date snapshot of the labor market after recent reports indicated that the next stage of the labor market recovery will be much slower going.
Investors will get the chance to hear from three senior Fed officials as they digest last week’s announcement of the central bank’s new strategy that would keep interest rates near zero even if inflation rises above its target in order to bolster the recovery in the economy and the labor market.
Vice Chair Richard Clarida is to give a speech on the Fed’s new monetary policy framework on Monday. Governor Lael Brainard is also set to deliver remarks on the new policy framework a day later, while New York Fed President John Williams is due to discuss the economy and the pandemic on Wednesday.
The Fed will enter its blackout period before its next policy meeting, due to be held on Sept. 15-16, at midnight on Friday.
On Friday the S&P 500 surged to its sixth record closing high since confirming a bull market on Aug. 18 powered by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in a rally that has highlighted the divide between the soaring stock market and a struggling U.S. economy.
With fiscal stimulus ebbing, signs are growing that the economy's recovery is slowing. Economists still expect a sharp rebound in growth this quarter, but are trimming estimates for the fourth quarter.
The S&P 500 is on track to post its strongest August in 34 years and stocks are set to go into September on a strong footing after the Fed’s commitment to keep interest rates near zero even if inflation runs hot.
Meanwhile, some new names will be appearing on the Dow from Monday after the index was adjusted with Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) replacing  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN).
Inflation figures out of the euro zone on Tuesday are expected to show price growth remained tepid in August, while unemployment figures the same day are expected to point to a slight uptick.
Data on German factory orders on Friday is expected to show that the pace of the recovery slowed in July.
Investors will also get to hear from several European Central Bank policymakers, with Vice President Luis de Guindos, Chief Economist Philip Lane and Governing Council members Jens Weidmann and Klaas Knot all making appearances during the week.
China’s August PMI reports on Monday and Tuesday should provide a health check on the world's second-largest economy.
The official manufacturing PMI on Monday is seen picking up to 51.2 in August from July's four-month high of 51.1 and Tuesday's Caixin manufacturing PMI is expected to ease to 52.7 from 52.8 in July.
Activity in the country’s vast industrial sector is steadily returning to levels seen before the pandemic paralyzed large tracts of the economy in the early part of the year.
Pent-up demand, stimulus-driven infrastructure and strong exports have been the main factors driving the rebound, but private consumption is lagging as consumers remain cautious about spending.

847,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2020 07:01AM ET</span>","UK's Sunak considers sweeping tax hikes to plug COVID-19 hole, newspapers say","LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Rishi Sunak is considering a sweeping set of tax increases to help fix the huge hole in the public finances left by the coronavirus pandemic, two newspapers said.
Tax hikes suggested by Treasury officials could raise an extra 20-30 billion pounds a year, the Telegraph and the Sunday Times reported, and some of them could be announced in an autumn budget statement by Sunak. 
However, officials working for Prime Minister Boris Johnson are fiercely opposed to a major tax raid on wealthier voters and want to consider spending cuts instead, the Telegraph said.
Britain's public debt has passed 2 trillion pounds ($2.7 trillion), pushed up by emergency spending on Sunak's coronavirus job retention scheme, tax cuts for businesses and consumers and even a dining-out subsidy to coax people back into restaurants.
Sunak has previously said some taxes will need to rise over the medium term.
But he is under pressure to provide more support for employers when the job retention scheme - under which the state has paid 80% of salaries for most workers kept on in their jobs - expires at the end of October.
The reported tax increases under consideration ranged from a sharp jump in corporation tax - which is currently far below the international average - cutting incentives for private pension contributions and increasing capital gains tax rates.
The Sunday Times said a reduction in foreign aid was under consideration. The Telegraph said officials were considering an end to a freeze on fuel duty and a tax for online retailers.
The Sunday Times said Sunak was considering a proposal to boost the corporation tax rate to 24% from 19% to raise 12 billion pounds next year, rising to 17 billion in 2023-24.
A Treasury spokesman said: ""We do not comment on speculation about tax changes ahead of fiscal events.""
LIMIT 'SCARRING'
Stephen Barclay, chief secretary to the Treasury, declined to comment specifically on any of the measures floated.
He told Times Radio: ""The real objective is to reduce the economic scarring from COVID ... The more we can limit that economic scarring then obviously the more flexibility that will give us as we go into the budget.""
Britain's economy shrank by a record 20% in the second quarter, the largest decline of any big country. There have been signs of a bounce-back but unemployment is expected to rise sharply as the job retention scheme is wound down. 
Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank, said it was too soon to raise taxes because of the uncertainty over the economy. The economy also faces a possible shock if London and Brussels fail to strike a trade deal soon on the relationship with the European Union once a Brexit transition period expires at the end of the year.
""The trick they need to play in this budget is to get the right level of stimulus as opposed to the reverse, whilst persuading people that they are taking seriously the need to deal with the deficit in the medium run,"" he told The Telegraph.

849,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2020 11:35PM ET</span>","Exclusive: HK survey shows increasing majority back pro-democracy goals, smaller support for protest movement","(Reuters) - A growing majority of people in Hong Kong support the pro-democracy movement's goals after China introduced a national security law for the city, but backing for the protest movement was a smaller 44%, a survey conducted for Reuters showed.  
Demonstrations have been far fewer and smaller than the mass protests that rocked the Chinese-ruled city in the second half of 2019, largely because of coronavirus-related restrictions on gatherings and the impact of the sweeping new law, analysts say.
The survey taken by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (HKPORI) was the first since the law was passed in the Asian financial centre on June 30.
It found nearly 60% of people were opposed to the security law, up from about 57% in HKPORI's previous survey in June, when few of the details were known. 
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam's office and China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, which comes under the State Council, or cabinet, did not respond to requests for comment about the results of the survey.
Ivan Choy, senior lecturer at Chinese University of Hong Kong's department of government and public administration, said public attitudes shifted after the new security law was implemented.
“Now there are more concerns when you ask people to come out"" to protest, he said, adding that police arrests have triggered ""more anger in society.""
   Police said they had arrested 25 people, as of August 20, including protesters, activists and a media tycoon under the new law, which makes crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces punishable with up to life in prison.
The Hong Kong Police Force did not respond to a request to comment on the impact of the arrests on public opinion. 
The government has said the law was needed to plug holes in national security exposed by the protests and to restore stability in Hong Kong. The survey found public support for the law was slightly over 31%.
Critics say the legislation further eroded the wide-ranging freedoms promised to the former British colony on its return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a one country, two systems agreement.
The latest survey asked: How much do you support or oppose the pro-democracy protest movement? The responses showed support at about 44%. 
The question replaced one in the June survey that asked: Generally speaking, how much do you support or oppose the protest movement surrounding the extradition bill? The responses showed support at about 51%.
Drawing firm conclusions from the near seven percentage point drop was difficult due to uncertainty over the impact of the changed wording, Robert Chung, head of HKPORI said.
The changes were made because the extradition bill has faded as an issue as it has been withdrawn.
For the poll, 1,007 respondents were randomly surveyed by telephone. The results, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points as in previous polls, were weighted according to the latest population figures.
        
SHARED ASPIRATIONS
While protests have been smaller and less frequent, the poll showed backing for the pro-democracy movement's key aspirations has risen. 
Support for the request for an independent commission of inquiry to look into how police handled the demonstrations saw a rise of roughly 4 percentage points to 70%.
The police did not respond to a request to comment on the level of public support for an independent inquiry. 
Police and the government have repeatedly said they used minimum force, that their sole goal was to restore law and order, and that there were adequate existing mechanisms to prevent and punish any indiscipline.
Support for universal suffrage, another key demand, remains strong with the backing of 63% of Hong Kong citizens, about the same as in the June poll.
Support for amnesty for the arrested protesters rose to almost 50%, up five percentage points since June.
Lam remains unpopular with 58% of respondents saying she should resign, little changed from the June poll. Nevertheless, that's an improvement over perceptions in March, when 63% of respondents said she should resign.
Opposition to the pro-democracy movement's demands inched down to 19% from 21.5%.
The survey also showed that support for the idea of Hong Kong independence, which is anathema to Beijing and a focal point of the new legislation, remained at about 20% while opposition to independence hovered slightly below 60%. 
HKPORI has conducted four polls for Reuters on how residents of the city regarded the protest movement. The previous surveys were conducted in December, March, and June.
Last month, police searched its offices, citing ""a report from the public that the computer system of a polling organisation was suspected of being hacked and some personal information of the public was leaked.""
At the time, HKPORI was helping organise an unofficial primaries vote for the pro-democracy camp to choose candidates for the legislative election, an operation the government and Beijing said may have violated the new security law.
The pollster had said it would cooperate with the police investigation, which it had hoped would be ""impartial"".
    
UNHAPPINESS OVER POSTPONED VOTE
The latest survey showed just over half of the respondents were unhappy with the Hong Kong government's move to postpone the legislative election by a year. It had been scheduled for September.
The government said the postponement was ordered due to worries about rising numbers of coronavirus cases, and denied there was any political motive.
The survey shows opposition candidates could have done well. 
""The poll results show the more suppression from the government, the higher the opposition,"" said Ming Sing, associate professor of social sciences at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
Authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing have repeatedly rejected the notion that they were suppressing Hong Kong citizens. 

They say Hong Kong's wide-ranging rights and freedoms remain intact and protected by law, and that defending national security was China's unquestionable sovereign right.

853,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 11:30AM ET</span>",'Fresh paint on crumbling building': Lebanon bank clean-up raises doubts,"By Tom Arnold and Raya Jalabi
LONDON/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Bankers and analysts have voiced scepticism about attempts by Lebanon's central bank to clean up the country's banks, warning they must form part of a wider rescue plan to fix its broken financial and economic system.
In a series of circulars on Thursday, the central bank told domestic banks to raise fresh capital, urge their big depositors to move funds back to the country and provision for a 45% loss on their Eurobond holdings.
The move follows a further downward spiral in Lebanon's fortunes since an explosion this month at Beirut's port. Even before the blast, which led to the government's resignation, Beirut was grappling with its worst financial crisis in the wake of protests and a default on its foreign currency debt in March.
""These ad-hoc policy decisions will add to Lebanon's credit and banking woes and risk undermining the little progress made in talks with the IMF,"" said Alia Moubayed, managing director at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), referring to already stalled negotiations with the International Monetary Fund over a bailout. 
""Nor are they anchored in a revised macro-fiscal and debt restructuring plan that factors in the deteriorating socio-economic context and worsening debt dynamics after the blast.""
The bank's initiative comes ahead of a visit next week by French President Emmanuel Macron, who is pressing Lebanese leaders to make political and financial reforms to unlock foreign aid and ease the economic crisis, including by making a full audit of state finances and the central bank.
Lebanon's banks, at the centre of the crisis because of their large holdings of the government's debt, were told by the central bank to raise their capital by 20% by the end of February 2021 or leave the market.
REFORMS
""The necessity to have a cleaning in the banks after the default is there because we want banks to resume their role and activity,"" Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh told Reuters when asked about the purpose of the circulars.
But lenders wouldn't be able to resume activity without sufficient funds with their correspondent banks, he said. 
Several analysts reacted cautiously.
""It is difficult to see why the private sector would pump fresh equity capital into the banking system unless a full asset clean-up has first taken place,"" said Rahul Shah, head of financials equity research at Tellimer.
Analysts also questioned how the requirement for banks to take a 45% loss on Eurobond holdings tallies with a rescue plan released earlier this year by the now-caretaker government that proposed 75% haircuts on external debt and 40% on domestic debt.
The 45% loss also does not reflect the current market value of the bonds, which plummeted deeper below 20 cents in the dollar on Thursday, in the wake of the circulars and comments from French government officials that aid will not be forthcoming without reforms.
""We do not know how the negotiation between Lebanon and the creditors will end up but we have taken the normal provision that follows such a default,"" Salameh said, adding the 45% level could be readjusted ""in both ways"", depending on negotiations.
The provision level could signal a desire to pursue smaller haircuts or treat bank holdings differently from foreign holdings of Eurobonds, said Patrick Curran, senior economist at Tellimer.
Banks were told that the provisions, which also included a 1.89% loss on their hard currency deposits with the central bank, should be in place within five years, but were extendable to 10 years with the approval of the central bank. 
The timetable was likely an effort to ensure that banks, already struggling to remain solvent, did not flout international regulatory capital floors, said analysts.
""It's camouflage,"" said a former senior central bank official. ""They're trying to dress things up, to put a fresh coat of paint on a crumbling building.""
There was also wariness about attempts by the central bank to require large depositors to return some of their funds from overseas, with analysts viewing it a precursor to some depositors having to share financial losses.
INCENTIVES 
Banks were told to urge depositors who transferred more than $500,000 abroad as of July 1, 2017 to deposit funds in a special account in Lebanon that will be frozen for five years and would be equivalent to 15% of the transferred amount. The equivalent deposit amount is raised to 30% for ""politically exposed persons"".
The directive was causing panic among some bank customers with large overseas holdings, said one financial services source, while other industry sources questioned what incentives would be offered to convince people to return funds.
""This is not the right way to do things,"" said the financial services source. ""The government, not the central bank, has to take decisions on this as this is a legal issue. 
""Asking normal citizens to transfer some of their money back doesn't seem fair, and if there is concern about politically exposed persons then an audit should first be carried out on their accounts to determine if they've benefited from financial engineering.""

The source was referring to a practice of Lebanon's central bank that involved siphoning dollars from local banks at high interest rates to keep the government's finances afloat.

854,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 10:27AM ET</span>",U.S. Goods-Trade Gap Swells to Second-Biggest on Record,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S.’s deficit in merchandise trade swelled to the second-largest on record last month as imports climbed to pre-pandemic levels, buoyed by demand for automotives.
The overall deficit grew to $79.3 billion in July from a revised $71 billion in June, according to Commerce Department data released Friday. The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a $72 billion shortfall in July, and the reading was bigger than all except one of 37 estimates. The biggest gap was recorded in December 2018, at $79.5 billion.
Exports increased 11.8% from June to $115 billion, the highest since March. Imports rose by the same measure to $194.3 billion, it said. That was the most since February.
The monthly gain in exports was led by a 44% surge in automotive-vehicle shipments. Industrial supplies, such as oil, rose 7.1% and capital goods, which include factory machinery and parts, jumped 7.5%. Foods, beverages, and animal feed were up 2.1% from June. Overall, exports are 15.9% are lower than a year earlier.
“Global and U.S. demand continue to face a long and risky path towards recovery, so we see trade struggling to continue to regain ground quickly,” James Watson and Gregory Daco, economists at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note.
Two-Way Trade
While the total value of U.S. two-way trade picked up to $309.3 billion from $276.7 billion in June, the number is still well below pre-pandemic levels as the world struggles to recover from the coronavirus crisis. That said, American exporters may be benefiting from a decline in the value of the dollar, which makes U.S. goods more competitive in overseas markets.
On the imports side, industrial supplies gained 10.7% from a month earlier. Capital goods, cars, and consumer merchandise all increased. Imports are still 7.6% lower than July 2019.
The report also showed that wholesale stockpiles fell 0.1% during the month, while retail inventories gained 1.2%. Both provide an indication of what companies expect consumer and business demand for products will be in months to come.

855,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>","Fed's targeting of higher inflation could backfire, paper suggests","(Reuters) - Targeting higher inflation, as the Federal Reserve suggested it would do in a revamp of its monetary policy strategy on Thursday, could end up slowing growth instead of boosting it unless the U.S. central bank's message to households and businesses is carefully crafted and conveyed.
That's the conclusion of research presented on Friday at a conference attended virtually by global central bankers, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his fellow policymakers at the U.S. central bank. On Thursday, the 17 Fed policymakers signed on to a strategy of aiming for slightly too-high inflation to offset what has been a persistent undershoot on their 2% inflation goal.
""A 'verbal' intervention aimed to stimulate the economy by raising inflation expectations and thus lowering real interest rates can backfire if unintentional income effects overwhelm the desired intertemporal substitution effects,"" University of California, Berkeley, professor Yuriy Gorodnichenko and his colleagues wrote. 
The paper analyzed surveys and found that many businesses and households often interpret higher inflation as a harbinger of slower growth. 
Families and firms, they found, could react to expectations of higher inflation not by spending their money quicker for fear of its future devaluation, but by saving their cash so as to weather what they foresee could be a worse economic environment. 
To avoid cutbacks in spending and investments just when they want the opposite, central bankers should try to reach the public directly and simply, perhaps through social media, and take care to emphasize their overall aims for the economy, rather than focus just on inflation, the economists urged. 

""Simplicity and transparency are needed to break through the veil of inattention,"" they wrote.

856,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 10:09AM ET</span>",U.S. Real Estate Pain Leaves Foreign Investors Holding the Bag,"(Bloomberg) -- Foreign investors who backed real estate projects in return for U.S. visas are emerging as losers in the pandemic-driven commercial property crisis.
In Manhattan, Chinese investors who helped fund Related Cos.’ Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Yards have called for arbitration to pressure the developer into returning their money. On Long Island, a separate group assumed the lease to the Nassau Coliseum, after billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov’s Onexim Sports and Entertainment decided to walk away from the project.
The investors, who backed development deals through the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ EB-5 program, aren’t the only ones getting hammered by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has kept mall-goers, hotel guests and office workers home, pushing commercial-property owners into delinquency. But EB-5 investors, who cared more about coming to the U.S. than financial returns, have less leverage than most.
“Cash is king during Covid, and developers are reluctant to let go of any cash,” said Mona Shah, a New York lawyer who works on EB-5 deals. “It doesn’t help that there are some developers who show distinct lack of respect for EB-5 money. It’s easy money.”
Real Estate Investors Skip Paying Loans While Raising Billions
Shah said she represents a hotel developer who is looking to reduce the principal owed on an EB-5 loan, because the property closed due to the pandemic and is unlikely to return to profitability quickly. In other cases, developers are seeking to extend loan terms or withhold payments entirely, Shah said.
No Timetable
At Hudson Yards, roughly 2,000 EB-5 investors poured $1 billion into the Manhattan project through a series of deals, according to a demand for arbitration filed recently by Chicago lawyer Doug Litowitz. The investors were unsophisticated about U.S. real estate, according to Litowitz, and were told by the Chinese firm that helped Related raise money that they would be repaid following approval of their work visas, known as green cards.
But the funding was structured as a preferred equity investment, not a loan, and there was no fixed timetable for returning the money. After Neiman Marcus Group Inc., the luxury retailer that was the anchor of the upscale mall at Hudson Yards, declared for bankruptcy, Litowitz asked Related to tell his clients when they could expect to get their money out of the project. He also asked the developer to open its books so his clients could determine whether the pandemic had diminished the value of their investment.
“The Related deal is interesting because the terms given to the Chinese are so bad that it’s almost like a test case for how bad a structure can be and still be legal,” said Litowitz, whose brother Alec is the chief executive officer of hedge fund Magnetar Capital. “Dostoyevsky said, ‘If murder is allowed, everything is allowed.’ That’s how I feel about this case.”
Related has been unmoved by those requests.
“Financial investment returns are a function of the market economy and obviously this is a challenging time,” Related spokesman Jon Weinstein said in an email. “We were off to a good start, but now we need to be patient.”
EB-5 was a sleepy program until the 2007-2008 financial crisis, when developers like Related looked overseas to replace traditional financing sources. They found a bonanza: foreign investors who viewed U.S. real estate as a safe asset and were principally concerned with obtaining visas, meaning they were willing to accept returns as low as 1% and sometimes less.
The program, which provided visas to foreign investors who sank at least $500,000 into U.S. projects that created at least 10 jobs, was meant to promote investment in rural areas, as well as urban locales with high unemployment. But gerrymandered districts allowed EB-5 funding to flow to developments like Hudson Yards and an Extell Development Co. tower on Manhattan’s Billionaire’s Row.
Wild West
Roughly $36 billion in EB-5 capital flowed into the U.S. from 2010 to 2019, according to estimates from Invest In the USA, a trade group, though the program has become less popular as the backlog of applications grew and the investment threshold increased.
The program attracted scrutiny when Kushner Cos., the developer formerly run by Jared Kushner, who is President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, sought EB-5 funds from Chinese investors.
It also gained a reputation as a Wild West, rife with false promises and conflicts of interest. Theoretically, lending money to big projects should have been more solid, but even marquee developers haven’t been shielded from the pandemic.
Billionaire Prokhorov to Close Long Island’s Nassau Coliseum
As Covid-19 cases surged through the New York City area this spring, Prokhorov’s Onexim canceled sporting events and concerts at the Nassau Coliseum. By June, the company decided that the pandemic had made the events business unappealing, and signaled its intention to hand the arena lease over to lenders.
On Aug. 20, Nassau County announced a deal with the U.S. Immigration Fund, which funneled EB-5 capital into renovations at the arena. As part of the agreement, an affiliate of the EB-5 group assumed the lease, promising to operate the building so the National Hockey League’s New York Islanders could eventually return to the ice.
Maureen Hanlon, CEO of Nassau Events Center, which had operated the building for Onexim, said she was sorry to abandon the arena, but happy to reach an agreement that allows “the county to receive its rent and, most importantly, for the fans to have a functioning arena as soon as health guidelines allow.”
Gary Friedland, who has studied the program as a scholar-in-residence at New York University’s Stern School of Business, expects that plenty of other borrowers will walk away from an EB-5 projects in the months to come.
“For years, I’ve predicted there would be a flood of defaults,” Friedland said. “It’s risky capital. If there’s a reduction in values, it’s going to get hit.”

“I would prefer to wait,” Kaplan said Friday during a Bloomberg Television interview with Michael McKee. “I would prefer to get more clarity on the path of the virus. I think we’ve already given quite a bit of forward guidance.”
The Fed’s quarterly projections “have already said that rates are going to stay low for the rest of this year and all of next year, and I would prefer to show some restraint here,” he said.
Officials will publish a fresh update of the projections at the conclusion of their upcoming Sept. 15-16 meeting.
Kaplan’s comments follow the U.S. central bank’s announcement Thursday that it had updated its policy strategy for achieving its employment and inflation goals. Fed officials say they are now trying to keep inflation near 2% on average over time, which means they will likely seek to run inflation above target following periods of below-target inflation.
Minutes of their last policy meeting in July showed that a number of Fed officials thought “providing greater clarity regarding the likely path of the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate at some point.”

858,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 09:31AM ET</span>","Yen surges as Japan's Abe quits, stocks mixed after Fed shift","By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - The Japanese yen surged and stocks fell on Friday after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe resigned for health reasons, while broader share markets were mixed as investors worried about a lack of detail in the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy shift.
The Nikkei 225 share index closed down 1.4% while the yen soared more than 1% after Abe announced his resignation, saying he would stay as prime minister until a new leader was appointed. [nT9N2F501S]
There has been speculation about Abe's health all week but the resignation of Japan's longest-serving premier rattled investors given he has spearheaded efforts to revive growth through his reflationary ""Abenomics"" policies. [nL4N2FU0RW]
The yen, seen as a safe-haven currency to buy in times of uncertainty, jumped 1.2% to 105.33 yen per dollar, putting it on course for its biggest one-day jump since March when the coronavirus pandemic roiled global markets.
Some analysts said the yen's rally seemed excessive given that, while there was uncertainty, Abe's successor was unlikely to alter economic policy significantly because the country remains in the middle of a battle to avoid deflation and lift growth.
""Of course it is unclear what kind of policy his successor will pursue. But realistically: There is unlikely to be a major change - especially in the direction of a much more restrictive policy"", said Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
Graphic: Japanese markets react to Abe resignation https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgvdoorzpo/Japan2808.png 
It was a mixed day for stock markets elsewhere as investors continued to digest the Fed's widely-awaited shift in its policy framework, which was unveiled on Thursday and saw the central bank place more emphasis on boosting economic growth and less on worries about inflation running too high. 
The policy aims for 2% inflation on average, so too slow a pace would be followed by an effort to lift inflation ""moderately above 2% for some time."" [nL1N2FT0PR]
Stocks initially jolted higher as investors bet interest rates would remain low for longer and more stimulus was likely. 
But share markets have since been choppy, with some traders disappointed the Fed did not reveal more details about how the new framework would work or provide clues as to what it will do at its next policy meeting.
""It's not so much about what to do about inflation when it comes but about getting inflation above target. The challenge is to get inflation up to target and not very much was said about that,"" said Colin Asher, a senior economist at Mizuho.
The Euro STOXX 50 was last down 0.21%, while Germany's DAX slid 0.3%. Britain's FTSE 100 was flat.
U.S. stock futures clawed their way higher and back to near record levels after earlier volatile trading on concern about the impact of a hurricane that struck the centre of the U.S. oil industry. S&P 500 e-mini futures was were last up 0.24%, a seventh straight day of gains.
Asian shares outside of Japan limped higher, with the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gaining 0.22%.
DOLLAR DECLINE DEEPENS
In currency markets, the dollar extended an earlier drop and was 0.8% lower against a basket of other currencies by 1115 GMT, taking it back towards its lows of last week - which saw the dollar at its weakest since early May 2018. 
The greenback has fallen sharply since June as many analysts are predicting more pain ahead if U.S. rates are to stay low for longer and amid political uncertainty before the U.S. presidential election in November.
The euro seized on the dollar's weakness to gallop another 0.7% higher and was last at $1.1905, close to a more than two-year high it recently touched. 
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to as high as 0.789%, the most since June 10, which caused the yield curve to steepen, reflecting the Fed's tolerance for higher inflation. It was last at 0.752%, up 1 basis point on the session.
Crude oil prices see-sawed as a massive storm raced inland past the heart of the U.S. oil industry in Louisiana and Texas without causing any widespread damage to refineries. 
Brent crude rose 0.09% to $45.13 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude edged 0.23% higher to $43.14 per barrel. [nL4N2FU0GF]

The spot gold price bounced 1.49% to $1,957 an ounce. The precious metal tends to perform well when the dollar is weak and the Fed sends a dovish message on the future path of interest rates. [nL4N2FU0KX]

859,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 09:05AM ET</span>",Powell's white-collar world led to Fed pivot for blue-collar jobs,"By Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - Raised in a white-collar Washington suburb, a product of prep schools, elite colleges and the 1% world of private equity, Jerome Powell is an unlikely candidate to tilt U.S. monetary policy toward the working class.
But just as former Federal Reserve chair Paul Volcker changed U.S. central banking to fight inflation in service of the larger economy, so Powell, the current Fed chair, has seized the moment to ease up on that battle and, if a new Fed approach works as expected, register economic gains for a broader set of Americans through more jobs and better wages.
If it sounds more humanist than ""central bank,"" the underpinnings nonetheless are deeply practical. 
They rest on a decade's recognition that inflation is much less of a threat than in Volcker's day, on changes in Powell's own perspective from his first years as a Fed governor, and on research about how persistent inequality can cause larger economic damage. In the background, workers and labor groups scarred by the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis pressed for a different approach from the central bank.
""The Fed has come to its common senses,"" recognizing that higher employment should be recognized as a good thing not treated as a risk, said William Spriggs, a Howard University professor and chief economist for the AFL-CIO. A frequent participant in Fed events, Spriggs made the case for the central bank to let labor markets ""run hot"" so the benefits of economic growth would be more broadly spread. 
""It's clear. The days where the Fed Chair's primary role is to pull away the punchbowl from the labor market just as things start going well should be seen as decisively over,"" said L. Josh Bivens, research director at the labor-focused Economic Policy Institute, referring to a metaphor coined by a former Fed chair, William McChesney Martin, to describe how the central bank acts to contain inflation. ""It is a very welcome acknowledgment about how much more room they have to probe the absolute limits of full employment,"" Bivens said. 
In acknowledging those arguments Powell echoed the language now more frequently heard that racial, ethnic and other economic disparities are more than just morally suspect. Indeed, as Powell said Thursday, they ""weigh on the whole economy.""
""I WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED""
The change comes at an opportune time. Thriving stock markets amid massive, pandemic-related unemployment and a national debate about racial justice have drawn attention to Fed policies as possible drivers of inequality. 
The Democratic party platform for the November presidential election suggests, for example, making the Fed take explicit account that the unemployment rate for blacks is historically about twice that of whites. That divide began to narrow as the unemployment rate dropped to historic lows last year, and the new Fed framework now downplays the notion that unemployment could get too low.
If the framework change was driven by the low risk of inflation, it is also ""an incredibly pragmatic approach,"" said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Under the Fed's prior framework, centered around an almost ironclad trade-off between employment and inflation, ""they were leaving employment gains on the table,"" Posen said. ""This is a move away from fancy rules, abstract concepts, and it is absolutely justified.""
It was no spur-of-the-moment shift.
Since he was appointed to the Fed board in 2012, in fact, Powell has steadily moved from centrist Republican concerns about government debt and inflation to embrace the view that there was more ""slack"" in the economy - the Fed's euphemism for people not working - than generally recognized. 
A graduate of elite schools - Georgetown Prep, Princeton University and Georgetown University Law School - Powell was a well-known figure in Washington for his prior work in the government, at the  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) private equity firm and at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank. He made clear early in his tenure that he would challenge some of the standard thinking at the central bank - bringing a lawyer's critical thought, a deal maker's practicality, and a non-economist's skepticism into the room.
In a speech two years ago at the Fed's Jackson Hole summit, he laid out why he felt some of the core concepts relied on by the economists at the central bank weren't much help in setting policy. It was a step toward the new framework announced on Thursday, at this year's virtual version of the same annual symposium.
His partner in devising it: Vice Chair Richard Clarida, a former managing director of the global bond giant PIMCO.

""If you had told me who would have made the biggest, let's just call it progressive step, in changing monetary policy, and told me the background of these two, I would have been surprised,"" Bivens said.

Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest serving premier and author of the signature shock-and-awe ""Abenomics"" stimulus strategy, has resigned for health reasons.
Sweeping to power in late 2012, Abe deployed his three arrows of Abenomics - large-scale monetary easing, fiscal spending and structural reforms - to reignite the world's third biggest economy after years of sub-par growth and falling prices.
Japan watchers are split on its success. The central bank's ""bazooka"" stimulus programme improved business sentiment and weakened the yen, giving exporters windfall profits that trickled down to wages and new jobs.
But the country has also been sinking deeper into recession and Abe leaves behind a pile of unfinished business. Investors are keen to figure out who his successor could be and what this means for the legacy of Abenomics.

2/ NFP REALITY CHECK
Friday's August non-farm payrolls will be a reality check on the devastation wreaked by the coronavirus pandemic on Main Street, even as Wall Street rallies to record highs.
Economists polled by Reuters forecast the U.S. economy created 1.55 million new jobs versus 1.76 million in July.
Weekly jobless claims hovered around 1 million last week, suggesting a labour market recovery may be stalling as the health crisis drags on, government support dries up and Congress remains gridlocked over potential new stimulus.
Jobs data is also in focus after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell rolled out a sweeping rewrite of its approach, saying the Fed would put more weight in bolstering labour markets. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 hit record highs, powered by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in a rally that has accentuated the divide between the blistering stock market and a still-badly damaged U.S. economy.

Fresh readings of China's factory activity should provide a health check on the world's second-largest economy.
The vast industrial sector is steadily returning to levels seen before the pandemic paralysed huge swathes of the economy early this year.
Pent-up demand, stimulus-driven infrastructure and surprisingly resilient exports have been the main drivers propelling the rebound, but private consumption is lagging as consumers remain cautious about spending.
Signals point in the right direction. Industrial profits grew in July at the fastest pace since June 2018.
The official PMI, scheduled for Monday, is seen picking up moderately to 51.2 in August from July's four-month high of 51.1 and Tuesday's Caixin factory PMI is expected to ease to 52.7 from 52.8 in July.

Data releases across bigger emerging markets should provide fresh reading on how developing nations are weathering the post-pandemic landscape.
Turkey's GDP reading due on Monday is expected to show a contraction of nearly 12% in the second quarter, which would be its worst year-over-year performance in over a decade.
Turkey's lira has tumbled to record lows in recent weeks and the economy, suffering also from a severe hit to tourism, is expected to shrink for the full year.
Data on Tuesday is expected to show Brazil's economy shrank 9.4% in the second quarter, as the country suffers the second worst coronavirus outbreak after the United States. Economic activity began to stir after President Jair Bolsonaro launched fiscal spending to deal with the COVID-19 aftermath, but optimism has been dented by fears this approach could derail his austerity agenda.

5/ GREEN REVOLUTION
The euro zone's benchmark bond issuer, Germany, is set to sell its first green bond in September, perhaps as early as next week.
The sale of at least 4 billion euros of new green debt marks a milestone for a market that accounts for less than 4% of global bond issuance, making it difficult for central banks and investors to build green bond portfolios.
Yet green bond supply is growing fast and stands to benefit from hefty state spending in the wake of the coronavirus shock.
Germany is a laggard. France issued its first green bond in 2017, others such as the Netherlands and Belgium followed. Still, Europe's biggest economy now has its sights set on issuing green bonds across the yield curve quickly, providing a reference point that could encourage other sovereigns to sell green debt. Better late then never, as they say.

863,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>","Payment holiday parachute might COVID-proof government bonds, top fund says","By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The option of a one-time payment holiday during times of intense crisis might enable countries to pandemic-proof their bonds, a prominent debt fund believes.
Economic fallout from COVID-19 has triggered a record number of sovereign defaults in 2020, and managers at Boston-based GMO, heavily involved in sovereign restructurings in recent years, have proposed redesigning bonds so that countries can suspend or even wipe off debt payments for up to a year. 
Credit rating agency S&P has downgraded 51 countries this year, and four - Lebanon, Ecuador, Argentina and Belize - have already defaulted, beating a record set in 2017.
""In the case of Ecuador, it might have provided enough liquidity relief to prevent a default,"" said GMO's Carl Ross, one of the payment holiday plan's two architects and a negotiator in Ecuador's and Argentina's restructurings.
He favours that idea over current approaches such the linking of debt payments to economic fortunes chosen in 2012 by Greece, and the ""hurricane clause"" - offering debt relief if a second catastrophic storm hits - used in Grenada's 2015 restructuring.
""Our proposal is to revert to something much simpler,"" Ross said. ""The whole idea is to prevent countries getting into distress in the first place"".
Sui-Jim Ho, a partner at Cleary Gottlieb - the law firm that helped draft Granada's hurricane clause - said discussion around temporary debt suspensions was gaining traction.
However, he questioned how simple implementing them would be.
""We still need to figure out how the pandemic trigger event should be drafted,"" he said ""...Defined too loosely and it could be triggered too easily. Defined too restrictively and you could end up with too little too late.""
Graphic: Bond prices plunge ahead of defaults https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvllxenvb/Pasted%20image%201598352935580.png
GAME THEORY
Ross said the potential criticism that GMO's proposal could be abused by politicians looking for creative funding options was a low risk.
Bond markets would soon work out governments that tried to play the system, and as the deferral option would only be available once - or perhaps once a decade for long-term bonds - it was also likely to be used sparingly.
""Interactions between bond markets and governments are a 'repeated game' ... We believe this dynamic would be a very effective self-policing mechanism,"" he said.
His idea would need International Monetary Fund or U.S. Treasury support to take off, and a country would also have prove it was workable.
Ross said he suggested it to Ecuador but the process was moving too fast by then, and it wouldn't have prevented Argentina or Lebanon defaulting as their debts had already spiralled out of control. 
Countries hit by multiple crises wouldn't be saved either as having more than one deferral or debt forgiveness option would ramp up their borrowing costs.
Ross and the proposal's co-author, Mustafa Ulukan, estimate that a single one-year deferral option might only add 0.6% to the 8% a country with a low B-grade rating might pay to borrow for 10 years.
The approach could also address 'freeriding' criticism private sector bondholders are now facing for not following G20 governments and allowing the world's poorest countries to suspend debt payments during COVID-19.
Pressure for that to happen is growing but creditors warn the rating agencies would class it as a default, opening up a host of problems. That is something GMO thinks its plan would avoid.
""This (deferral) option, if broadly used, would be extraordinarily valuable in the current global environment,"" Ross said. ""This year and 2021, we have a lot of countries that are going to default.""

865,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 06:42AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday, August 28th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com --- The dollar falls and gold rises as the world absorbs the implications of the Fed's policy shift. Shinzo Abe steps as down Prime Minister of Japan, hitting the Nikkei. U.S. stocks are set to open mixed, Europe's economic mood stutters a bit in August, and oil stays well bid as Hurricane Laura blows out. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, August 28th.
1. Dollar falls, gold rises as Powell goes easy on inflation
The dollar weakened and gold prices rose sharply as the market absorbed the implications of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech on Thursday.
Powell had said the Fed will tolerate inflation overshooting 2% for some time in order to compensate for years of sub-target inflation – raising speculation that the Fed will increase its monetary stimulus to support an economy that is making an uneven recovery from the pandemic.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six developed market currencies, fell 0.7% to its lowest level in two weeks, testing a new 28-month low.  The euro rose back above $1.19 and sterling tested the $1.33 level.
Gold futures rose 1.4% to $1,960 an ounce, encouraged by the apparent vindication of the currency debasement narrative that has driven much of the recent rally.
2. Sayonara, Shinzo
Shinzo Abe, Japan’s longest ever serving Prime Minister resigned due to ill health. In eight years in office, Abe has been frustrated by a series of crises and by Japan’s internal economic problems and has failed to fulfil his promise of victory over deflation.
The Nikkei 225 index fell 1.4% to a two-week low on the news, while the yen strengthened in a reflex reaction to the political uncertainty created.
That uncertainty ought to stay within limits. Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party is likely to stay in power for the foreseeable future, and many of the mooted successors are people hand-picked by Abe over the years because of their closeness to his thinking.
3. Stocks set to open mixed, with DJIA leading again
U.S. stock markets are set to open mixed on Friday with industrials again set to outpace tech stocks in the wake of Powell’s policy shift on Thursday.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow 30 futures contract was up 88 points or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was up 0.2%. The Nasdaq 100 contract, by contrast, was down 0.2%.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), all at the center of speculation that a deal for video-streaming app TikTok’s U.S. operations is imminent. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the sale was necessary not only on national security grounds, but also to increase competition in the social media space.
4. Clouds on Europe's horizon
Europe’s economic recovery stumbled a bit in August as the coronavirus showed signs of returning, exploiting the relaxation of lockdown and social distancing measures to accommodate the summer tourism season.
German consumer confidence weakened and French consumer spending fell in month-on-month terms, although economists argued that the headline numbers were worse than the underlying trends.
Italian business and consumer confidence both rose, however – although in the case of business, the improvement was less than hoped. The flattening out of the recovery hasn’t proved a material drawback to the continent’s bond markets yet: Italy managed to sell 10-year bonds at a rate of 1.11% earlier.
5. Oil prices stay well bid as Hurricane Laura passes
Crude oil prices gave ground as Hurricane Laura moved up through the U.S. in much-diminished form, having failed to cause any kind of lasting damage to the Gulf region’s energy infrastructure, either offshore or among refineries and storage facilities.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down less than 0.1% at $43.02 a barrel, while the global benchmark Brent was also down less than 0.1% at $45.58.  
The passing of the hurricane allows the market to refocus on what has been a generally supportive set of news this week, with demand holding up well enough to take another decent bite out of U.S. stockpiles.

""The basic success of Abenomics is from its first arrow, or its bold monetary policy, which saved the Japanese economy from decades of stagnation,"" Koichi Hamada, professor emeritus of economics at Yale University, told Reuters.
""As for the third arrow of structural reforms, we can say that labour shortages helped streamline operations and boost efficiency,"" he said.
""But we didn't see enhanced​ progress in productivity partly because the Japanese society tends to be averse to radical changes,"" he said in a written interview on Thursday, a day before Abe's surprise decision to step down.
After sweeping to power in late 2012, Abe deployed his three arrows of ""Abenomics"" - large-scale monetary easing, fiscal spending and structural reforms - to reignite the world's third biggest economy after years of subpar growth and falling prices.
Hamada was among those who played a key role in crafting ""Abenomics"", providing the academic backbone of the programme.

With his resignation, Abe leaves behind a mixed legacy with some quick-hit successes overshadowed by his failure to make lasting changes to an economy hobbled by low productivity and an ageing population.

867,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 06:26AM ET</span>",U.S. economic recovery hampered by wobbly performance in powerhouse states,"By Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - Of the many tragedies in the U.S. coronavirus epidemic, among the largest was that the nation's four economic powerhouses - California, Florida, New York and Texas - bolted to opposite corners early in an often politicized response to the crisis.
Democratic-governed California and New York tackled the spread of the virus aggressively with lockdowns and other steps that exacted a heavy toll on their economies. Republican-led Texas and Florida, in contrast, took a more hands-off approach.
Neither tandem, so far, has managed to pull off the tricky balancing act of getting and keeping infections under control while fostering a speedy and sharp economic rebound.
The result: A U.S. recovery hampered by underperformance in four states that account for about 35% of the country's economic output.
New York has scored the one singular victory in suppressing the virus. But its economy remains on its heels with a jobless rate that sits at 15.9%, more than five percentage points above the U.S. average.
The other three continue to battle on both fronts.
""Most of the responses have been a big disappointment,"" said Harvard University economics professor James Stock, who argued early in the outbreak that a ""no-fun"" world of limited social engagement, widespread testing for the virus and use of masks offered a way to solve the health crisis and, ultimately, fix the economy.
That was a prescription even New York has struggled to follow, let alone a nation with no uniform federal response.
More than 5.8 million U.S. residents have been infected with the coronavirus and more than 179,000 killed by the associated COVID-19 disease, according to a Reuters tally.
With the outbreak still raging nationally, key parts of the New York economy, like hotels and tourism, won't bounce back even as the state's coronavirus case rates remain under control with only a handful of deaths each day.
Daily deaths in each of the three other big states, meanwhile, are at more than a hundred.

BIG FOUR, BIG LAGGARDS
The four states, which account for about a third of the U.S. population, are home to the country's largest and densest cities as well as major travel hubs, ports and other infrastructure, and are top tourist destinations.
""It's unlikely the national economy fully recovers unless these four states do,"" said Oren Klachkin, an economist at Oxford Economics. ""A lackluster, muddling-through scenario now looks to be the most likely path,"" particularly as the impact of those four spills over into neighboring states and regions.
An Oxford index tracking the economic recovery shows California, Florida, New York and Texas as a group lagging more than 10 percentage points behind the rest of the country. 
The gap emerged early when New York and California, two of the early epicenters of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, imposed restrictions on businesses. It widened in June as infections surged in Texas and Florida, forcing those states to impose restrictions they had tried to avoid.
Graphic: The jobs drag https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/CORONAVIRUS-STATES/jznpnxkeypl/chart.png
Other data tell the same tale. 
Since March 1, data from time management firm Homebase http://www.joinhomebase.com/data shows California, Florida, New York and Texas lagging the rest of the country in both growth in the number of businesses that are open and the number of employees working. Department of Labor data shows that after accounting for roughly a third of all job losses in March and April, the four states are responsible for only about a quarter of the jobs regained in May, June and July.
Estimates of the return of retail shoppers gathered by cellphone tracking company Unacast showed Texas had reached 84% of its 2019 level through Aug. 15, Florida and California were just above 70% and New York below 60%. The rest of the country, taken together, had topped 90%.
Graphic: Employment at small business https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/COVID-STATES/bdwpkzdkdvm/chart.png
FOUR PENNSYLVANIAS
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics, said few states came close in his view to an optimal response.
Pennsylvania is one, with a mix of tough restrictions on its largest cities and a lighter touch in rural areas. The state avoided the more intense public conflicts over lockdowns and other measures that have erupted elsewhere in the United States.
A COVID-19 rebound in June was quickly corralled and daily fatalities are low.
""The state has managed (infections) down and kept them down ... The economy has made its way back solidly since then,"" Zandi said.
Nonetheless, it would take roughly four Pennsylvanias to match the economic heft of California alone, indicating just how long the road to a U.S. recovery may be with the big four states so hobbled. 
Graphic: Top states by GDP https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/STATES-COVID/bdwpkzerqvm/chart.png
'BIG COUNTRY'
The national recovery is seen by many economists as approaching something of a crossroads.
Key emergency measures to help families and small businesses lapsed in July, and negotiations in Congress over extensions are deadlocked. The country is still about 13 million jobs shy of February's level, and about 14.5 million Americans were collecting unemployment insurance in the latest week - more than twice the number seen in the 2007-2009 recession.
There are some optimistic signs. Growth in daily infections is moderating, with the 7-day moving average below 50,000 nationally from 66,000 in mid-June.
A Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) study estimated the country overall had met 2.5 of the 4 ""gating"" criteria for a fuller economic reopening. It had fallen near 1 in mid-July.
Even if the optimal response was missed, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said the worst was also avoided - particularly the early projected death toll of 2 million or more, and an economic calamity on the order of the Great Depression.
The back-and-forth debate about issues like school reopenings and wearing of masks, Bullard told Reuters in a recent interview, are part of finding a new balance. After early efforts to restart businesses and avoid mask mandates, for example, Texas Governor Greg Abbott acknowledged he should not have let bars reopen as early as they did. He ordered them to close again in late June and followed that up with a mask order.

""It is a big country. It is uneven. People are learning about the disease,"" Bullard said. ""We have plenty of chances to get it right going forward.""

868,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>","With new monetary policy approach, Fed lays Phillips curve to rest","By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - One of the fundamental theories of modern economics may have finally been put to rest. 
In the several years before the coronavirus pandemic took hold of the global economy, Federal Reserve policymakers watched as the U.S. unemployment rate fell lower and lower and waited for the jump in inflation typically associated with such a tight labor market. 
The expectations were based on a rule that has shaped decades of monetary policy decisions: the Phillips curve, or the concept that inflation tends to rise when the unemployment rate falls, and vice versa.
But the inflation that Fed officials anticipated never arrived, and in a monumental speech delivered on Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that the U.S. central bank's policymakers are done waiting. 
The Fed chief, speaking during the Kansas City Fed's annual conference, unveiled the central bank's new approach to monetary policy, which puts more emphasis on shortfalls in employment, and less weight on the fear that low unemployment could spark higher inflation.
""The conditions in the economy have changed to such an extent that this upwardly sloped relationship between inflation and employment has now changed,"" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist for RSM. ""Decades of thought at the Fed are now being pushed aside.""
With its landmark policy shift, the Fed is putting new weight on bolstering the labor market and less on inflation, promising to aim for 2% inflation on average over a period of time rather than using that figure as a hard annual target, as it had done since 2012.
With their new approach, Fed officials are essentially saying they are no longer worried about the unemployment rate falling too low. Now that inflation expectations are anchored at low levels, the economy has room to keep adding jobs. 
Policymakers can also wait a little longer for the gains to reach the workers on the margins - including Black, Hispanic and low-income workers - who are often the last to reap the benefits of a tight labor market, Powell said. 
""It is hard to overstate the benefits of sustaining a strong labor market, a key national goal that will require a range of policies in addition to supportive monetary policy,"" Powell said on Thursday, reflecting on the strong U.S. labor market that existed before the pandemic.
MORE FLEXIBILITY 
The relationship between inflation and employment was documented by A.W. Phillips, an economist from New Zealand who published a paper on the topic using British data on unemployment and wages from 1861 to 1957. 
The concept became a key aspect of the Fed's decisions on interest rates, motivating officials to start raising borrowing costs when they feared that inflation could soon take off. 
But policymakers and economists have noticed that the relationship between inflation and employment has weakened over the past several years. 
For example, between 1960 and 1985, a one-percentage-point drop in the gap between the unemployment rate and what economists viewed to be the long-run level of unemployment, would lead inflation to grow by 0.18 percentage point as measured by Personal Consumption Expenditures, according to a 2018 analysis by the Washington-based Brookings Institution. 
From 1986 to 2007, that effect was reduced to less than half of its previous impact and it ""essentially disappeared"" after 2008, the analysts wrote https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/08/21/the-hutchins-center-explains-the-phillips-curve. 
That shift, known as the flattening of the Phillips curve, made the tool less useful for predicting inflation and making monetary policy decisions, said Karim Basta, chief economist for III Capital Management. ""The main thing is that the Fed is not going to be preemptive in raising interest rates,"" Basta said. ""It's going to be more reactive to actual inflation.""
That shift gives the Fed more flexibility to make sure that all kinds of workers are benefiting from the economy before it begins to raise rates, Brusuelas said, nodding to the change in the Fed's statement saying that maximum employment should be ""broad-based and inclusive.""

""It's a good thing for the economy,"" he said. ""It means we're going to have more people employed once we emerge from the current crisis.""

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's day of reckoning has arrived.
After four months of tense debt talks, multiple pushed deadlines and amendments since an initial low-ball offer in April, bondholders will decide on Friday whether to accept the country's $65 billion restructuring proposal.
The main three creditor committees holding a large chunk of the bonds backed a deal earlier this month, bolstering confidence that the government will get the required level of support to allow a full deal to go ahead without holdouts.
A deal is key to pulling Argentina out of default and reviving the country already in its third straight year of recession as Economy Minister Martin Guzman turns his attention to the next step: renegotiating a failed $57 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund.
""After circling around each other for the better part of 2020, we have finally reached 'D-Day',"" said Patrick Esteruelas, head of research for Emso Asset Management in New York.
He added it was ""highly unlikely"" that legal thresholds on the bonds needed for a deal would not be reached. Collective action clauses mean the government needs holders of between 66.67%-85% of eligible bonds depending on the bond series.
A person with direct knowledge of the negotiations told Reuters that already the ""participation is very good"", though the final result would only be known on Friday. 
The restructuring invitation expires at 5 p.m. Eastern Time (2100 GMT) unless further extended. The new bonds are scheduled to be issued on Sept. 4 if a deal is struck.
Argentina's government made a breakthrough with its main creditor groups - the Ad Hoc Group, Argentina Creditor Committee and the Exchange Bondholder Group - on Aug. 4, when all three agreed to support an amended offer.
The bonds include so-called ""Exchange"" bonds, involved in a previous restructuring, and which have tougher legal clauses. The other ""Macri"" bonds were issued during the previous administration of conservative President Mauricio Macri.

Argentina needs support from holders of 85% of the Exchange bonds, and between 66.67%-75% on the Macri bonds, though individual bond series can have lower levels of support.

870,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 04:55AM ET</span>",Abenomics fails to deliver as Japan braces for post-Abe era,"By Leika Kihara and Takaya Yamaguchi
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's signature shock-and-awe 'Abenomics' stimulus strategy was already faltering even before his decision on Friday to step down due to health reasons.
That blunt assessment by many Japan observers underlined the daunting political challenge Abe has faced in his efforts to pull the economy out of decades of economic stagnation.
And the coronavirus crisis may have just put the final nail in the coffin to his 'three arrows' reform programme as the economy sinks deeper into recession, analysts say.
After sweeping to power in late 2012, Abe deployed his three arrows of Abenomics - large-scale monetary easing, fiscal spending and structural reforms - to reignite the world's third biggest economy after years of subpar growth and falling prices.
There were some quick-hit successes.
The Bank of Japan's ""bazooka"" stimulus programme lifted business sentiment and helped weaken the yen, giving exporters windfall profits that trickled down to wages and new jobs.
Corporate governance reforms drew in huge amounts of overseas money, pushing up foreign ownership of Japan's listed stocks to a record 31.7% in 2014 from 28% in 2012. It stood at 29.6% in 2019.
""We were able to end 20 years of deflation with the three arrows of Abenomics,"" the prime minister told a news conference on Friday announcing his resignation, when asked what he thought were his legacies.
But Abe will leave behind a pile of unfinished business for his successor.
""The focus at the moment will be on the coronavirus recovery and controlling the infection, regardless of who will be the next prime minister,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""There has been talk that Abenomics has been having a harmful impact, so I think the focal point will be on suggestions how to make changes to it.""
The biggest disappointment for the prime minister, and many Japan observers, is that the third-arrow reforms to reshape an economy hobbled by low productivity, a rapidly ageing population and a rigid labour market, have proved elusive.
""Abenomics has singularly failed to deliver Japan the domestic conditions that would spark higher growth beyond more reliance on external demand,"" said Brian Kelly, Managing Partner at Asian Century Quest.
PAYING THE PRICE
Now, Japan is paying the price as COVID-19 wipes out the short-term benefits brought by Abenomics, such as an inbound tourism boom, reflated growth and rising job availability.
Abe's failure to entice companies to spend more on capital expenditure has given Japan Inc a huge cash-pile that served as a liquidity buffer to weather the pandemic's shock.
But the experience may give firms an excuse to keep hoarding cash rather than spend on new business opportunities, which could stifle innovation and weigh on Japan's potential growth - factors Abe was focussed on addressing through the third arrow.
""COVID-19 may have reassured corporate executives that cash is indeed king,"" said Hideo Hayakawa, a senior fellow at the Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research. ""My fear is that companies may feel even more inclined to save rather than spend.""
Social distancing policies and other business constrains to contain the virus may cripple potential growth - already low due to slow progress in deregulating highly-protected medical and agriculture industries, and accepting more foreign workers to address chronic labour shortages.
Japan's potential growth rate, which used to exceed 4% in the 1980s, slid near zero last year from around 1% before Abenomics began, according to BOJ estimates.
""Structural reform, or the third arrow, has been the declaring failure of Abenomics,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
""Even the government's signature immigration reform last year was much ado about nothing, in practice.""
DEFLATIONARY MINDSET
COVID-19 also dashed a grand experiment of Abenomics that aimed to turn around Japan's ""deflationary mindset,"" in which companies and households hold off on spending on expectations that low growth and wages will persist.
The economy stumbled to a record contraction in the second quarter that shrank nominal gross domestic product (GDP) to 507 trillion yen ($4.8 trillion), around levels marked in 2013 and far distant from Abe's 600-trillion-yen target.

""Japan's economy may have performed better after Abenomics, but not enough to change public sentiment dramatically,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""With the pandemic, we'll likely see growth fall further. With many legacies of Abenomics wiped out, we know now there was no magic wand to fix Japan's chronic woes,"" he said.
Moreover, with the BOJ having exhausted its tool-kit to achieve its elusive 2% inflation target, policymakers face the challenge of seeking to revive the economy with a dearth of ammunition.
Japan's huge debt also limits room for big fiscal spending, which may keep any economic recovery weak, analysts say.

""Japan failed to normalise monetary and fiscal policies when the economy was in better shape,"" said former BOJ board member Takahide Kiuchi. ""Now, it's paying the price.""

871,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 03:40AM ET</span>",Turkey's economy severely contracted 11.8% in second-quarter as coronavirus hit: Reuters poll,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's economy is expected to have severely contracted nearly 12% in the second quarter due to the coronavirus lockdown, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, logging its worst year-over-year performance in more than a decade. 
The median estimate in a Reuters poll of 14 economists was for an 11.8% contraction in gross domestic product (GDP), with estimates ranging from declines of 7.1% to 13.1%. 
The Turkish economy grew 4.5% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2020, propelled by a lending spree just before the pandemic brought on a sharp downturn beginning in March. 
The economy was near stand-still in the second quarter as Ankara shut schools and some businesses, closed borders and adopted weekend stay-home orders. Some factories were halted until the economy was mostly re-opened in June.
The second quarter plunge combined with a severe hit to the key tourism sector means the economy is also expected to shrink for the full year. 
The median estimate of 14 economists was for a contraction of 1.9% in 2020, with predictions ranging between declines of 1% and 3.8%.
Turkey's economy last contracted on an annual basis in the midst of the global great recession in 2009, by 4.7%. It shrank by 13.1% year-over-year in the first quarter of that year.
GDP growth had since averaged more than 5% on the back of cheap foreign funding and a construction boom, until a currency crisis in 2018 prompted another recession.
The central bank - which cut rates aggressively since mid-2019 - has held policy steady the last few months as the lira dropped to record lows, threatening bigger problems for the economy. 
Seen as a precursor to growth figures, industrial production contracted 16.9% year-on-year in the second quarter. Since then, trade, capacity utilisation and business confidence indexes have gained traction.

The Turkish Statistical Institute will release the GDP data for the second quarter at 0700 GMT on Aug 31.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is expected to pick up moderately to 51.2 in August from July's four-month high of 51.1, according to the median forecast of 16 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity on a monthly basis.
China's vast industrial sector is steadily returning to the levels seen before the pandemic paralysed huge swathes of the economy early this year. Pent-up demand, stimulus-driven infrastructure and surprisingly resilient exports have been the main drivers propelling the rebound, but private consumption is lagging as consumers remain cautious about spending.
Profits at China's industrial firms last month grew at the fastest pace since June 2018, official data showed on Thursday. 
""High frequency data such as blast furnace operating rates and crude steel daily output continued to climb in August, likely driven by rising infrastructure demand,"" said Jiang Dongying, Shanghai-based analyst at CIB Research.
""On foreign demand, the continued re-opening of overseas economies could help boost new export orders."" 
UK-based industry consultancy Off-Highway Research said on Wednesday it now expects a 14% jump in China's construction machinery sales due to government stimulus, having previously said it would dip 8% before COVID-19. 
With infrastructure and property investment set to drive growth for the rest of the year, investment Bank HSBC this week raised its forecast for China's 2020 GDP growth to 2.4% from 1.7%. 
""With an uneven recovery and uncertain global growth, Beijing is focusing on reflating the domestic economy,"" Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at HBSC, said in an article on Wednesday. 
""We thus expect policy to remain supportive with further interest-rate reductions this year – a 25 basis-point cut in the average reserve-requirement ratio to 9.15% and the one-year loan prime rate trimmed by another 20 points to 3.65%.""
The official PMI and its sister survey on the services sector will be released on Monday.

The Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Sept. 1, and analysts expect a reading of 52.7, easing from 52.8 in July. The Caixin services PMI survey will be out on Sept. 3.

873,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 02:30AM ET</span>","Japan factory output seen up again, pandemic clouds outlook: Reuters poll","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output likely grew for a second straight month in July, signalling a gradual recovery from the blow delivered by the coronavirus pandemic, a Reuters poll of 17 economists showed on Friday.
The jobless rate probably rose in July and the availability of jobs likely fell, while retail sales were seen down again, the poll showed.
While the higher factory output would indicate demand was improving, weakening retail sales would be a worrying sign for private consumption, which accounts for more than half of the world's third largest economy.
The mixed batch of data will likely underscore the fragility of an economy that suffered a record 27.8% contraction in the April-June quarter as the pandemic took a heavy toll on both domestic and external demand.
Economists say the economy has bottomed out but any recovery was seen modest as Japan, like many other countries, resumed economic activity only slowly given risks of a second wave of infections following the relaxation of lockdowns in late May.
""Economic activity is gradually normalising, with factory output seen picking up, centring on transport machinery,"" said Shunpei Fujita, an economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting. ""However, we cannot rule out the risk that output may falter depending on the spread of infections.""
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) data due out at 8:50 a.m. Monday (2350 GMT Sunday) will likely show Japan's industrial output grew 5.8% in July from the previous month, following a 1.9% gain in June. 
In May, output hit its lowest level since March 2009.
The job market, which before the pandemic had been its tightest in decades, is likely to have weakened in July. The poll saw the jobless rate rising to 3.0% from 2.8% in June and the jobs-to-applicants ratio edging down to 1.08 from 1.11.
Retail sales likely fell 1.7% year-on-year in July, after a 1.2% drop in June, the poll showed.
METI will issue retail sales data at 8:50 a.m. Monday (2350 GMT Sunday), while labour data is due at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday (2330 GMT Monday). 

Separate data out at 2 p.m. Monday (0500 GMT) will likely show housing starts tumbled 12.5% in the year to July, broadly similar to June, the poll showed.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports likely shrunk for a sixth straight month in August, as effects from fewer working days outweighed a gradual recovery in global demand as more countries relax coronavirus lockdowns, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
August shipments were expected to have contracted 11.5% from a year earlier, according to a median estimate of a Reuters poll of 11 economists, compared with a 7.0% drop in preliminary data for the first 20 days of the month and a 7.1% decline in July.
There were 22 working days in August, 1.5 days less than last year.
""The sharper decline in August exports is due to fewer working days ... The average per-day exports, however, were seen shrinking at a slower pace, underpinning continued recovery momentum,"" said Lee Sang-jae, economist at Eugene Investment & Securities.
Other economists also believe exports are slowly turning the corner, given improving demand from the nation's major trading partners China and the United States, particularly for electronics.
South Korea's economy relies heavily on trade, with exports and imports accounting for 63.7% of its 2019 nominal GDP.
On Thursday, the Bank of Korea sharply downgraded its 2020 economic projection to a 1.3% contraction, the worst in more than two decades, from a previous forecast for a 0.2% decline, given a resurgence in virus infections.
South Korea has reported triple-digit daily jumps in new cases for over two weeks, but the government stopped short of shifting the country up to the highest level of social distancing measures on Friday, as it stood cautious about further economic fallout.
August imports were expected to tumble 15.2% year-on-year, far worse than a 11.6% plunge in July.
""Imports will continue to shrink by a double-digit rate as a resurgence in coronavirus slows recovery in domestic demand,"" said Ha Keon-hyeong, Shinhan Investment Corp economist.
Meanwhile, 10 economists predicted industrial output in July would rise by a seasonally adjusted 1.9% month-on-month, slower than 7.2% in June, but they worry data going forward may worsen, reflecting the virus spread.

Ten economists also estimated consumer prices would rise a median 0.4% in August from a year earlier, faster than 0.3% in the previous month.

""We'll make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country, as I've already been doing. Joe Biden's agenda is Made in China. My agenda is Made in the USA.""
Trump portrayed himself as having been willing to challenge China on trade during his speech to the party faithful and asserted his Democratic rival in the November election, Joe Biden, would not be as tough.
The former real estate developer spent much of his first term waging a trade war against China over its trade practices, technology transfer and industrial policies, imposing punitive tariffs on $370 billion worth of Chinese imports.
In May, he threatened to impose new taxes on American companies that produce goods outside the United States, another move his administration could make to push supply chains away from China and raise new trade barriers.

Trump made a similar comment last week during a campaign event in Pennsylvania, when he said: ""We will give tax credits to companies to bring jobs back to America. And if they don't do it, we will put tariffs on those companies and they will have to pay us a lot of money.""

876,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 12:27AM ET</span>",Fed’s New Plan to Lift Inflation Faces Skepticism,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s new plan to run the economy hot looks easier said than done as the central bank confronts multiple forces holding down inflation.
“The Fed needs to articulate very clearly how they plan to achieve the new objective,” Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), wrote in a note to clients. “Otherwise, these are just words on paper that don’t really mean anything.”
Chair Jerome Powell Thursday outlined a new approach to setting U.S. monetary policy. The Fed, he said, will sometimes allow inflation to run above the 2% target to make up for prior undershoots, and allow unemployment to run lower than officials had previously tolerated.
The move confirmed to investors that the Fed is likely keep interest rates near zero for years to come as it seeks to decisively achieve its inflation goal, adopted in 2012. Inflation has averaged only 1.4% since then amid headwinds affecting the U.S. and other major economies, including weak productivity growth, globalization, aging populations and technological change.
September Meeting
Fed policy makers meet again Sept. 15-16 when they’ll have a chance to spell out how the new strategy will shape their policies aimed at pulling the U.S. economy out of its worst downturn since the Great Depression.
Economists at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said officials may clarify their guidance on the path of interest rates by linking future hikes to reaching certain thresholds for inflation and employment. Minutes of their July meeting showed they’d debated this approach.
Powell’s announcement, though not entirely unexpected, marked the completion of a historic shift for the world’s most powerful central bank. Instead of worrying that very low unemployment would provoke inflation, they now have moved their focus almost fully onto too-low inflation.
To justify that, he made a point of explaining why persistently low inflation is a problem for central bankers, particularly when combined with low economic growth. It results in very low interest rates, even during economic expansions. That means policy makers have little room to cut rates when a downturn strikes.
Worse Outcomes
“The result can be worse economic outcomes in terms of both employment and price stability, with the costs of such outcomes likely falling hardest on those least able to bear them,” Powell said.
On the other side of the argument, there’s a camp of investors convinced that the Fed’s ultra-easy monetary policy and massive government spending risk re-igniting the runaway inflation of the 1970s.
Still, many observers viewed the Fed’s ability to lift inflation with skepticism, especially considering that much of the world has just tumbled into a new recession -- caused by the coronavrus pandemic -- that’s stifled demand and sent U.S. unemployment north of 10%. Both of those factors conspire to put more downward pressure on inflation.
The Fed may also be hindered in delivering if Congress doesn’t provide additional significant fiscal support. Lawmakers have approved $3 trillion of aid for workers, struggling businesses and the overall economy. But they have failed to reach an agreement on a new package even as provisions of the previous round expired.
Out of Their Hands
“It is doubtful that they can achieve overshoots of inflation anytime soon, and it is mostly out of their hands, in my view, whether or not they will get it even in the medium term,” Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told reporters following Powell’s speech.
Ryan Sweet, head of monetary policy research at Moody’s Analytics, sounded equally doubtful, and not only because of the pandemic.
“The Fed can say they want inflation to overshoot, but that doesn’t mean it will occur,” he said “Demographics and technology will be pushing against inflation.”
Other economists noted that Powell was silent on precisely what will make inflation move above the 2% goal. Unemployment hit 3.5%, a half-century low, in 2019, and still inflation, measured by the Fed’s favorite gauge, never topped 1.6% that year.
‘Not Obvious’
“What is not obvious is exactly how the Fed intends to achieve a persistently higher inflation rate” other than promising to use the same tools the Fed employed in the last downturn, Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist and now partner at Cornerstone Macro wrote in a note to clients.
“Those tools took us out of the Great Recession but did not generate inflation,” Perli wrote. “It is possible that the Fed intends to use those tools in stronger doses, but even so there is reason to believe that the power of those tools may be lower today that it was years ago.”
In its framework review, Fed officials rejected, at least for now, alternative tools that other central banks have used, including negative interest rates and capping the yields of certain government bonds.
James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, offered a defense of the new strategy and its potential for success in an interview Thursday on Bloomberg Radio with Michael McKee. He said the approach could help raise inflation expectations among investors, a factor economists believe heavily influences inflation outcomes.
“I think there was a perception both in markets, and perhaps in the policy making community as well, that 2% inflation was some kind of a ceiling,” he said. “Inflation expectations should be moved up a little bit now in markets in response to this.”
Ironically, Powell sounded a bit more cautious in projecting the results.
“I think it’s a very promising set of changes to deal with what is the reality of a quite difficult macroeconomic context,” he said in a question-and-answer session following his speech. “Time will tell, and our actions will ultimately tell.”

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's finance minister said on Thursday the government will consider drafting its fourth supplementary budget of this year should the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic significantly worsen.
As coronavirus cases rise, officials are debating whether they should deploy the toughest stage 3 social-distancing rules, where schools and business are urged to close, which would inflict further pain on Asia's fourth largest economy.
""Should we adopt the stage 3 social distancing rules, its impact on the economy will be a lot more serious,"" Hong Nam-ki said in a briefing where remarks were embargoed for Friday.
""So regarding the fourth extra budget, that will depend on the pace of new coronavirus case increases, as well as decision on whether we raise social distancing rules.""
A fourth extra budget would bolster the 277 trillion won ($233.87 billion) worth of fiscal stimulus already pledged by the government this year to fight the pandemic.

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 371 new coronavirus cases as of midnight Thursday, bringing the country's total to 19,077, including 316 deaths.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's deepest recession on record will linger through the rest of this year and begin to lift only in early 2021 as a rapid surge in the coronavirus spread squelches a nascent rebound in consumption and business activity, a Reuters poll showed.
New Delhi has already set aside $266 billion of economic rescue spending and the Reserve Bank of India has slashed interest rates by 115 basis points since March, suggesting more is required to shield the economy from the pandemic-induced disruptions to businesses and livelihoods.
The coronavirus is spreading faster in India than anywhere else in the world, with more than 3.3 million people already infected and related deaths at over 60,000. COVID-19 has kept tens of millions of people shut indoors and made many millions jobless in the world's second most populous country.
""Although this might be the low point in the ongoing crisis, the rapid increase in infections this quarter provides no hope of a near-term recovery,"" said Prakash Sakpal, senior Asia economist at ING.
""The macro policy has hit a snag amid stretched public finances and rising inflation. This means pretty much nothing can save the economy from continued deep declines for the rest of the year.""
With business activity completely stalled for the most part in the previous quarter owing to a nationwide lockdown to contain the virus' spread, the Indian economy likely shrank 18.3% during that period, according to the August 18-27 poll of over 50 economists.
While that was slightly better than the 20.0% contraction predicted in the previous poll, it would still be the weakest rate by far since official reporting for quarterly data began in the mid-1990s. 
The economy is forecast to contract 8.1% in the current quarter and 1.0% in the next - a downgrade from 6.0% and 0.3% contraction, respectively, predicted in a July 29 poll, dashing hopes of a recovery this year.
Asia's third-largest economy is expected to grow again in the first three months of 2021, by 3.0%.

https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/oakpeoozkpr/India%20economic%20growth%20and%20monetary%20policy%20outlook.PNG
But that will still leave it down 6.0% for the fiscal year that ends in March, which would be the worst 12-month performance on record, blowing out -5.2% for calendar year 1979, during the second Iran oil crisis. That latest forecast was revised down from a median forecast of -5.1% last month.
Under a worst-case scenario, the contraction for each of those periods was expected to be much deeper than predictions from last month as well as the latest base-case consensus.

https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/jznpnxxbmpl/India%20economic%20outlook.PNG
While there have been some signs of recovery, with an increase in agricultural produce on good monsoon rains and targeted government spending, a majority of other businesses continue to show weak performance.
The RBI unexpectedly paused last month on rising inflation concerns.
While the consensus showed the central bank was expected to ease once more next quarter by 25 basis points, taking its repo rate to 3.75%, a significant minority of economists, or 20 of 51, predicted the RBI to stay on the sidelines this year.
Asked when Indian GDP would reach pre-COVID-19 levels, over 80% of economists, or 30 of 36, said it was likely to take more than a year, including nine who predicted it to take more than two years.
""The outlook for economic growth is bleak and there are now signs that the post-lockdown recovery has stalled before it ever really got going,"" said Darren Aw, Asia economist at Capital Economics, in Singapore.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A telephone call on coronavirus economic relief between U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and an adviser to President Donald Trump ended on Thursday with no breakthrough, and Pelosi said talks would not resume until the Trump administration agreed to $2.2 trillion in aid.
Pelosi and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows spoke by phone for about 25 minutes, the first chance in weeks to resume stalled COVID-19 aid negotiations. But the two sides soon appeared to be as far apart as ever. 
""This conversation made clear that the White House continues to disregard the needs of the American people as the coronavirus crisis devastates lives and livelihoods,"" Pelosi said in a statement following her conversation with Meadows. 
""We're willing to come down - meet them in the middle - that would be $2.2 trillion, and when they're ready to do that we'll be ready to discuss and negotiate the particulars,"" the top Democrat in Congress told reporters.
""But we can't go any less because we have to meet the needs of the American people we will not short change them we will not nickel and dime them."" 
Meadows and Pelosi are two of the four negotiators who were involved in talks on legislation to help Americans and businesses suffering from a coronavirus pandemic that has now killed nearly 180,000 people. The others are Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. 
The talks broke down on Aug. 7, with the sides far apart on major issues including the size of unemployment benefits for tens of millions of people made jobless by the pandemic, aid for state and local governments and funding for schools and food support programs. 
The Democratic-controlled House in May passed a $3.4 trillion coronavirus relief bill but Pelosi offered to reduce that sum by $1 trillion. The White House, which had proposed $1 trillion in aid, rejected the offer. Democrats have since demanded repeatedly that the White House agree to ""meet in the middle"". 
The Pelosi-Meadows phone call came hours before Trump was due to accept his party's nomination Thursday evening. Some Democrats have said they did not expect the White House to resume negotiations in earnest until after this week's Republican National Convention. 
On Wednesday, Meadows said in an interview with Politico that he was not optimistic negotiations would resume soon.
U.S. airlines have warned that massive layoffs will be coming without further aid during the pandemic.
They are hoping a fresh stimulus bill will extend for six months $25 billion in payroll aid that expires on Sept. 30 under legislation approved earlier this year.

The head of the union representing American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL)' pilots, who are facing 1,600 furloughs, sent a letter to Trump on Wednesday urging action to extend the package and prevent tens of thousands of layoffs on Oct 1.

881,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 03:46PM ET</span>","In landmark shift, Fed rewrites approach to inflation, labor market","By Jonnelle Marte, Ann Saphir and Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Thursday rolled out a sweeping rewrite of its approach to its dual role of achieving maximum employment and stable prices, putting new weight on bolstering the U.S. labor market and less on worries about too-high inflation.
The Fed's new monetary policy strategy, unveiled at the start of an annual central banking conference, pledges to address ""shortfalls"" from the ""broad-based and inclusive goal"" of full employment, a nod to research showing racial income disparities hold back economic growth. 
It also promises to aim for 2% inflation on average, so that periods of too-low inflation would likely be followed by an effort to lift inflation ""moderately above 2% for some time.""
The change suggests the U.S. central bank's key overnight interest rate, already near zero, will stay there for potentially years to come as policymakers woo higher inflation. 
""It's no news that (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell doesn't want to raise interest rates,"" said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Mellon. What is news, Reinhart said, is that the Fed has now enshrined a degree of tolerance for inflation in its guiding document.
The policy shift is arguably the biggest for the Fed since Paul Volcker remade the central bank into an inflation-slaying force four decades ago, when prices were spiraling higher. 
Powell's new policy blueprint, designed for a world where weak inflation, low interest rates, and slow economic growth appear to be here to stay, puts the labor market front and center.
The changes acknowledge, the Fed said in its description of its new strategy, that ""downward risks to employment and inflation have increased,"" and include a new promise to use the central bank's ""full range of tools"" to achieve its goals of stable prices and a strong labor market. All 17 Fed policymakers signed on to the new strategy.
""Our revised statement reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for many in low- and moderate-income communities, and that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an unwelcome increase in inflation,"" Powell said as he explained the changes at the start of the Kansas City Fed's central banking conference.
The gathering is normally held in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, but was convened this year online because of the coronavirus pandemic.
""It is hard to overstate the benefits of sustaining a strong labor market, a key national goal that will require a range of policies in addition to supportive monetary policy,"" Powell said. 
On Thursday, the Fed released a library of staff papers and research on the topic, including one arguing that average inflation targeting would help a broad set of Americans benefit from the economy.
Issues such as income distribution have traditionally been considered out of the Fed's domain, but the differing economic outcomes among different groups of people has been a focus of recent research that concluded the economy as a whole can benefit from more inclusive policies. 
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES
With tens of millions of people out of work because of the pandemic, the economy in a deep crisis and Americans preparing to vote in a contentious Nov. 3 election, the Fed's new approach is both an acknowledgment of fundamental economic changes that began well before the pandemic, and a map for how the Fed plans to conduct policy going forward.
Still, the map is fairly blurry: the Fed's transformation of the way it manages monetary policy included no explicit promises on how long it may keep rates low, or how high it would allow inflation to go. Indeed, Powell said the Fed's new approach to inflation would not be dictated by an explicit mathematical formula.
For more specific guidance, investors may need to wait until at least September, when the central bank is expected to adopt so-called outcome-based guidance for its key federal funds rate, promising to keep it near zero until inflation reaches a specific threshold, perhaps 2.25% or 2.5%. 
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told CNBC on Thursday that he would not be comfortable with leaving rates where they are if inflation stayed at 3% for a year. 
Market reaction signaled that, at least for now, investors believe the Fed is serious about its new approach.
Yields on U.S. Treasuries with the longest maturities - the most sensitive to inflation risks - shot to their highest in more than two months. U.S. stocks traded largely higher, with the S&P 500 (SPX) index on track for a new record closing high. The dollar (DXY) was flat against a basket of currencies.
After this week's central bankers' event and the mid-September policy meeting, Fed officials will not meet again until the day after the U.S. election.
The Fed's framework review began nearly two years ago through public hearings and research to explore how monetary policy should be adapted for a low interest rate environment. On Thursday, it said it could conduct a new review of policy every five years. 
Still, the jury is out as to whether the Fed will be able to hit the mark with its new inflation and labor market goals.

""It is not assured that we will get a return of tight labor markets,"" Tharman Shanmugaratnam, the head of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, told the annual economic symposium. ""We're not going back to a pre-COVID world.""

882,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 03:46PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Lebanese banks that can't raise capital must leave market, central bank governor says","By Laila Bassam and Ellen Francis
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese banks that cannot increase their capital by 20% by the end of February 2021 will have to get out of the market, Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh told Reuters on Thursday.
Those leaving would do so by giving their shares to the central bank, Salameh added. He said he could not speculate how many of Lebanon's nearly 40 banks would exit the market.
""We hope all the banks will meet the criteria,"" he said in a phone interview. ""But after February, those who do not will have to get out of the market...The deposits will be preserved because the bank will not be put into a bankruptcy situation.""
The central bank's foreign currency reserves stand at $19.5 billion and obligatory reserve at $17.5 billion, he said.
Lebanon's cash-strapped banks have frozen savers out of their dollar deposits and largely blocked transfers abroad since late last year as the country sank into a financial meltdown on a scale it has never seen. 
The central bank wants domestic banks to boost liquidity at their correspondent banks abroad, with which they do not have sufficient funds, Salameh said. 
The state, one of the world's most indebted, defaulted on its foreign currency debt in March, citing critically low reserves. Inflation and poverty have soared as the crisis wiped out the value of the local currency on the informal market.
With the country running out of dollars, the central bank has kept providing foreign currency for fuel, wheat and medicine imports at an official peg.
Salameh told Reuters he could not say how long the central bank could keep subsidising essential imports which is ""depleting reserves"". 
He has been cited as saying the bank cannot use its obligatory reserve to finance trade once it reaches the threshold.
""We are not about to float the currency and therefore for the time being we are living with these two exchange rates,"" he said, adding that this decision also lies with the government.
A devastating explosion at Beirut port this month, which killed at least 180 people and wrecked swathes of the city, on top of a COVID-19 outbreak, has compounded woes. 
Talks with the IMF, which Lebanon entered in May, had stalled in the absence of reforms and as a row emerged between the government, the banking sector and politicians over the scale of the country's vast financial losses.
Salameh said it was in Lebanon's interest to press ahead with negotiations to try to secure an IMF programme.

When asked whether he would answer calls by critics for his resignation over financial policies, he said: ""We will see...It's easy to put the cause on me or on the central bank but I think it's a different story.""

The French central bank forecast in June the euro zone's second-biggest economy would contract 10% this year before rebounding 7% in 2021 and 4% in 2022, and is due to update its projections on Sept. 14.
""The recovery is roughly going as expected. If there is any change (to the forecasts), it would without a doubt be that 2020 is a little better than expected, which mechanically would make the recovery in 2021 and 2022 a bit less strong,"" Villeroy told the French employers federation MEDEF's end-of-summer conference.
Villeroy added the European Central Bank would keep supporting the recovery in the broader euro zone economy by maintaining low interest rates and abundant liquidity.
He also said that it was essential to have an inflation target over the medium term, reacting to a major revision on Thursday from the U.S. Federal Reserve of its monetary policy approach giving less weight to worries about high inflation.
The ECB's inflation objective, which targets a rate of close to but less than 2% over the medium term, is one of the things it is looking at during a strategic review now underway.

""I don't know what precise form that will take for us at the ECB, but you can be assured that a credible and symmetric inflation target will remain at the heart of our action,"" Villeroy said.

885,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 01:18PM ET</span>",White House Dissatisfaction Slows IRS Payroll Tax Guidance,"(Bloomberg) -- Guidance for companies on President Donald Trump’s payroll tax deferral directive is being held up by White House dissatisfaction with the rules drafted by the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service, according to three people familiar with the matter.
The White House wants employers, not employees, to be responsible for paying back the Social Security levies when they come due next year, one of the people said. Under current law the IRS can seek to collect unpaid payroll taxes from both employers and employees.
The division between the White House and the tax lawyers at the IRS and Treasury has meant businesses have waited for nearly three weeks for guidelines that would implement Trump’s directive when it’s set to begin next week, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.
Trump and his advisers have promoted the payroll tax deferral as a boost for workers with the economy still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic a little more than two months before the national election.
Large employers, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc., have said they’re waiting to see the IRS guidance before deciding whether to stop withholding payroll taxes from their workers’ checks. Trump’s order defers the payment deadline for employee payroll taxes from Sept. 1 through the end of the year, though Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said it is optional for companies to participate.
‘Fully Committed’
A Treasury Department spokeswoman declined to comment, and the IRS did not not immediately respond to requests for a response. White House spokesman Judd Deere (NYSE:DE) said, “The administration is fully committed to implementing the president’s order to provide much-needed relief to hardworking Americans, but I won’t comment further on an internal policy process.”
Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said last week that the administration is “exploring ways” to forgive the tax payment completely. The taxes “essentially can be forgiven if you stretch it out five years, eight years,” he said.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce last week called Trump’s plan “unworkable” because it would create a large tax bill for employees. As a result, many companies would likely continue to withhold payroll taxes and remit the money to the government, the business lobby and more than 30 other trade groups said in a letter to Mnuchin and congressional leaders.
The 6.2% tax levy that employees and employers each pay go to help fund Social Security. Trump has said he will push for Congress to forgive those tax liabilities if he is elected to a second term, but both the presidential election outcome and Congress’s willingness to cut taxes funding the popular retirement program are far from certain.
Unexpected Relief
The White House has few good options as it gives companies guidance on how to implement Trump’s Aug. 8 order to delay the collection of the payroll taxes. Requiring companies to pay back the taxes on behalf of their workers means that few employers will likely implement Trump’s deferral. Passing the responsibility onto employees could be politically risky and set up millions of people with unexpected tax bills.
The delay in the IRS guidelines has been a relief for some companies, because it gives them an easy excuse to not participate in the deferral, said Adam B. Cohen, a partner at law firm Eversheds Sutherland LLP.
“The fact that there hasn’t been guidance is, in some ways, a positive for a lot of clients who really were not looking forward to having to deal with it,” he said.

886,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 12:10PM ET</span>","What is the Fed's new policy framework, and why does it matter?","By Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - Here are five things to know about the Federal Reserve's new strategy for achieving stable prices and maximum employment. The landmark policy shift was announced on Thursday.
WHAT'S THE NEW STRATEGY?
The new strategy puts more weight on bolstering the labor market and less on worries about inflation that is too high.
Calling full employment ""a broad-based and inclusive goal"" the new policy statement pledges that the U.S. central bank will make policy decisions based on ""shortfalls"" from full employment."" 
The new language signals the Fed will continue to combat unemployment that is too high, but that it won't raise the alarm over unemployment falling too fast or too far, as it had done in the past. 
The new strategy also incorporates a loose form of average inflation targeting, under which the Fed would aim to make up for periods when inflation is too low by allowing periods when inflation is too high. Over time, inflation would average 2%.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE ECONOMY?
Under the old framework, a drop in unemployment to super-low levels was treated as an early warning signal for unwanted inflation. 
But that never happened. Before the coronavirus pandemic hit, the U.S. unemployment rate had fallen to near 50-year lows, and there was no sign of an inflation surge. The new framework takes that lesson into account, leaving room for the Fed to keep policy loose even as employment increases. 
While the new approach could mean higher prices for food and other essentials, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in explaining the shift, that it's a price worth paying to keep inflation from dropping too low and for achieving a stronger labor market. 
HOW WOULD IT WORK?
Since inflation has been undershooting 2% for years, the strategy signals that Fed policymakers won't even think about raising interest rates until inflation overshoots their 2% goal for some period of time. 
The idea is that if households and businesses are convinced inflation is headed higher, resulting in a reduction in their future buying power, they will take steps to borrow, spend and invest their money sooner.
That burst of early spending in a downturn should help create jobs and bolster demand, pulling the economy more quickly out of the doldrums. 
In the meantime, the Fed's new focus on pushing unemployment down could help bring a broader swath of workers back into the labor market. 
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?
For the strategy to work, households and firms have to believe that Fed policymakers have jettisoned the mindset of inflation fighters and have fully embraced a new role as keepers of a strong labor market.
And they must buy into the idea that a bit of inflation is indeed a good thing, especially if it allows for more job creation.
In addition, keeping interest rates low for an extended period tends to lift stock prices, perhaps benefiting wealthier Americans more than the less-advantaged, whose welfare appears to be at the heart of the rewrite of the Fed's new framework. 
Another issue: Just because the Fed says it would welcome higher inflation, that doesn't mean it can actually generate it. The actual mechanics of how it would engineer higher prices are absent from the new document, though it did pledge to use its full range of tools to achieve its goals.
WHY A NEW FRAMEWORK? 
The Fed has been concerned that its recession-fighting tools won't work well in a world where inflation and interest rates are pinned lower than they historically have been, giving the Fed less scope to fight downturns with its traditional tool of cutting interest rates. 
The centerpiece of the Fed's previous framework, adopted in 2012, was an official 2% inflation goal - low, but enough above zero to provide a buffer against growth-sapping deflation in a downturn. 

But in the years that followed, the economy did something Fed policymakers didn't expect: despite years of near-zero interest rates and trillions of dollars of bond-buying, inflation stayed stubbornly below target. 
And low inflation, in turn, meant the Fed had little room to help the economy once it did falter just by cutting rates. To address the current crisis, the central bank has had to resort to politically-fraught tools like bond-buying and direct lending to businesses. 
The revamp isn't specifically aimed at helping the Fed fight the deep recession triggered by the coronavirus, though it could prove to be a test case.

887,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>","Economic drag on U.S. to persist long after virus is gone, central bankers are told","By Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - Even after the virus that spawned the current U.S. recession is vanquished, the drag on economic growth will persist much longer than widely understood, according to research presented to an influential group of central bankers on Thursday. 
That is because, having experienced the impact of a pandemic once, businesses will change their behavior to account for a perceived increase in the likelihood of another such scourge, Columbia University professor Laura Veldkamp and her co-authors wrote, a phenomenon known as belief scarring. 
The result: lower business investment, fewer jobs, and downward pressure on interest rates that translate to slow growth for years. 
""Our model's predictions tell us that the ongoing crisis will have large, persistent adverse effects on the U.S. economy, far greater than the immediate consequences,"" they said in the paper, to be discussed at the Kansas City Fed's annual economic policy conference. 
The event, usually held in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, is being conducted virtually this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The findings sharpen the argument for aggressive and immediate measures to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis on businesses, even if those measures appear to be costly endeavors in the short term. 
Wiping out 10% of firms' debt, for instance, would save just 1% of GDP in 2020, the authors estimate - but the value of those savings is estimated at about 11% of GDP if the long-term consequences are taken into account. 
""Preventing bankruptcies or permanent separation of labor and capital, could have enormous consequences for the value generated by the U.S. economy for decades to come,"" they wrote. ""Obviously, no policy can prevent people from believing that future pandemics are more likely than they originally thought, but policy can change how the ongoing crisis affects capital returns.""

(Reuters) - Small business staffing, shifts worked at industries and job openings posted by companies continued a sluggish performance over the past week, evidence that the pandemic's core wound to the U.S. labor market continues to heal only slowly.
Data provided by Homebase on staffing at a sample of small businesses fell for the week ending Aug. 23, and shifts worked across a variety of industries registered only tepid growth according to time clock data provided by Kronos.
Initial unemployment claims fell by 98,000 for the week ending Aug. 22, but remain over 1 million.
""Even as businesses have reopened and jobs have returned, layoffs are ongoing, reflecting interruptions to activity from virus containment that are likely resulting in permanent closures and job losses,"" wrote Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics. ""The risk of permanent damage to the labor market remains high.""

Though shifts did increase 1.2% over the week before, much of the rise was due to the reopening of schools. Job openings aggregated by Chmura Economics for the week ending Aug. 17 fell.
The labor market data stood in contrast to other high frequency measures [nL1N2FM0JX] and indexes of the recovery that pointed to steady improvement, including increases in visits to retail locations.

Counts of diners seated at restaurants kept by reservation site OpenTable rose, and an Oxford Economics index of the recovery jumped a full percentage point, largely driven by the continuing decline in new coronavirus cases. The seven-day moving average level of daily new cases was approaching 40,000 as of Wednesday compared to around 65,000 in mid-July.

Estimates of visits to retail sites from cell phone tracking companies Unacast and Safegraph increased over the week about 1% and 4.3% respectively.
Weakness in the labor market is a potential warning sign about the strength and durability of an economic rebound that began stronger and earlier than expected in May and June, but appeared to slow as the disease spread more virulently in the south and southwest. 
One positive note: the lapse of federal unemployment benefits and other fiscal programs has not led to a feared collapse of spending yet, and a weekly New York Fed index of annual GDP growth under current conditions has been rising.
Graphic: NY Fed Weekly Economic Index https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/WEI/xklpyzdyyvg/chart.png
Analysis of spending by Chase cardholders as well as other high frequency indicators showed that spending has held up so far.
Data ""on restaurant diners, hotel occupancy, airport travelers, and general mobility have continued rising thus far in August,"" JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) analyst Jesse Edgerton wrote. While there were signs of a spending slowdown in areas of higher unemployment, he said that at the national level, thus far, the lapse of benefits ""has not marked a sharp turning point.""
But neither are the wounds from the virus healing fast.
A Dallas Fed survey meant to provide labor market estimates in between the official monthly jobs reports showed employment among adults fell a full percentage point from the end of July through mid-August.
UBS analysts said they expect the number of jobs in the United States to grow by about 1.3 million in August, the same as in July and a pace that would require another 10 months to return to the employment levels of February.
The recovery ""is tapering off,"" they wrote in a Wednesday analysis.

890,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>","Trump says he saved 51 million jobs in pandemic. Economists, U.S. officials say otherwise","By Lawrence Delevingne, Chris Prentice, Michelle Price and Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Standing before half a dozen American flags during a press conference at his country club in Bedminster, New Jersey, President Donald Trump heralded what has become a central plank of his argument for re-election in November: his administration’s handling of the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Through the historic relief package that I signed into law, we saved over 50 million American jobs,” he said in the Aug. 15 remarks. Referring to his Democratic opponents, he said, “They don’t like these kind of numbers because they think it’ll hurt them in the election.”
The estimate that the $660 billion taxpayer-funded Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) saved some 51 million jobs has been trumpeted by the Republican Party, its Congressional leadership and the president’s reelection campaign. On Monday, Trump touted it again at a rally west of Charlotte, North Carolina, site of the Republican National Convention.
However, the PPP likely did not save 51 million jobs, or anywhere close to it, according to Reuters interviews with economists and an analysis of the program’s data. Half a dozen economists put the number of jobs saved by the initiative at only a fraction of 51 million – ranging between one million and 14 million.
“I don’t think there is an economist who would say that the program has saved 50 million jobs,” said Richard Prisinzano, who was a financial economist at the U.S. Department of the Treasury for 13 years before leaving in 2017. His rough estimate, Prisinzano said, is between five and seven million jobs saved, based on his own adjustments to other researchers' work at MIT and elsewhere.
Officials in Trump’s own administration give varying explanations for the 51 million figure. In interviews with Reuters, officials from the Treasury Department and the Small Business Administration(SBA), which oversee the PPP program, said the 51 million refers to the total number of workers reported by businesses approved for a loan - not the number of jobs that were saved.
White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow gave some support to that assessment in an interview with Reuters, saying he surmised the jobs figure was the sum of all jobs at businesses that received PPP loans.
“We saved a lot of jobs, there's no question about that,"" he said.
The PPP was part of some $3 trillion of bailout measures passed in the spring. At the time, there was little debate that funding was needed for small businesses as the economic blows from COVID-19 hit the United States.
Since then, congressional Democrats have challenged the data on the program, released by the administration in July. “We’ve seen some inaccuracies with the data in terms of how they calculate how many jobs were protected and saved,” said New Jersey Democratic representative Andy Kim in August, who sits on the Small Business Committee.
An economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation also questioned the figures. ""This data does not tell us how many of those jobs may have existed without the PPP loans. Additionally, everyone involved has an incentive to use inflated estimates,"" said Adam Michel, senior policy analyst for fiscal policy at the foundation.
Michel, who has not analyzed the data himself, cited the same research that former Treasury official Prisinzano did - a paper co-authored by economists at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, MIT and ADP Research Institute. That study concluded that about 2.3 million jobs had been saved through early June.
White House economic adviser Kudlow said the Treasury and SBA had access to the list of companies and bank loans, and they made the calculations.
“You had to put on the form how many employees you have when you're applying for the loan,"" he said. “My guess is they added them up.”
NUMERICAL DISCREPANCIES 
The uncertainty surrounding the 51 million figure was fueled by a discrepancy between the information the SBA asked lenders to gather from borrowers and the information it asked those same lenders to enter into its loan processing portal.
The SBA asked lenders only to gather each borrower’s number of employees, but when lenders subsequently processed the loan in the SBA portal, the agency also asked for the “number of jobs retained.” Lenders often put the number of employees into the portal's ""jobs retained"" box, according to numerous people familiar with the process. Skewing the numbers in the other direction, some lenders left “jobs retained” blank or put in zero, the people said.
Both the SBA and Treasury made officials available to speak with Reuters about the PPP on condition that they not be named.
The senior Treasury official said the 51 million figure was not just a sum of the job totals at recipient companies; it was supported by economic modeling as well. However, he added, “we can't with any kind of certainty say that all 51 million of those would have otherwise lost their job.”
Because the figure isn’t a count of jobs saved, the official added, “we've been careful to always use the word ‘jobs reported’ or ‘jobs supported’ by the program.”
The SBA official confirmed that, when borrowers filled out their applications, they supplied “just the number of employees. It wasn’t jobs retained.”
On Aug. 21, a week after Reuters interviewed the administration officials, the SBA appended a note to its monthly loan tallies, saying that to enhance accuracy the SBA would for now label data as jobs reported, not jobs retained.
Also on Aug. 21, the Small Business Administration reissued the full PPP dataset, fixing some of the problems that appeared when it was first made public in July. But the data still had holes. About 84,850 loans for amounts at $150,000 or above, had a zero in the jobs reported column, or the column was left blank. That problem applied to about 13% of loans at that amount.
The administration will have to wait until businesses apply for loan forgiveness to get a solid estimate of how many jobs were saved, economists and officials said.
'THE JOBS PRESIDENT'
Nailing down the numbers with the Trump campaign also remains difficult. Pressed for details on the 51 million figure Tuesday, campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said in an email that ""the PPP protected American companies which collectively employ 51 million Americans.""
That’s different from what the campaign claimed the day before on Twitter (https://twitter.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1297940273184624649) , when it posted a note saying, ""President Trump's Paycheck Protection Program saved 51 MILLION jobs.""

An animated “counter” ticked rapidly from one million to 51 million just below the message: ""He's the Jobs President and he's fighting for YOU!""

893,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 09:15AM ET</span>","Fed to target 2% average inflation, elevates focus on jobs","By Jonnelle Marte, Ann Saphir and Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Thursday rolled out an aggressive new strategy to restore the United States to full employment and lift inflation back to healthier levels in a world where it now believes that ""downward risks to employment and inflation have increased.""
Under the new approach, laid out in a fresh statement on the Fed's longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy approved by all 17 of its policymakers, the U.S. central bank will seek to achieve inflation averaging 2% over time, offsetting below-2% periods with higher inflation ""for some time,"" and to ensure employment doesn't fall short of its maximum level.
""Our revised statement reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for many in low- and moderate-income communities, and that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an unwelcome increase in inflation,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in prepared remarks for a speech explaining the changes.
With the U.S. economy in a deep economic crisis and just months before Americans vote in a contentious election, the Fed's new approach is both an acknowledgment of fundamental changes in the economy that began well before the coronavirus pandemic, and a map for how the Fed plans to conduct policy in a world where weak growth, low inflation and low interest rates are seen as here to stay.
With tens of millions of people out of work because of the fallout from the pandemic and the campaign for the Nov. 3 presidential election fast underway, the Fed's transformation of the way it manages monetary policy could result in it keeping rates lower for longer than previously expected, although the Fed made no explicit promises on that front.
Powell is speaking at the Fed's annual summer symposium, an event that is usually held in the mountain resort of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, but is being conducted virtually this year because of the pandemic. After this week's event and the mid-September policy meeting, Fed officials will not meet again until the day after the election.
The Fed's framework review began nearly two years ago through public hearings and research to explore how monetary policy should be adapted for a low interest rate environment. On Thursday it said it could conduct a new review of policy every five years.
Powell laid out a case for why low unemployment is a positive for the economy, especially for less-advantaged groups like Blacks.

""It is hard to overstate the benefits of sustaining a strong labor market, a key national goal that will require a range of policies in addition to supportive monetary policy,"" he said.

895,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 06:34AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday, August 27th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Jerome Powell lays out the Fed's strategy for the future, amid expectations of lower-for-longer interest rates. Weekly jobless claims and a revision to quarterly GDP figures will give a reality check on the economy's health. Stocks are in a holding pattern, while oil is still well supported as Hurricane Laura hits Louisiana and East Texas. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, August 27th.
1. Powell's big reveal
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will deliver a keynote speech that’s expected to lay the groundwork for a fundamentally looser monetary policy for the foreseeable future.
Powell is expected to detail the conclusions of a long review into the Fed’s policy framework, and most analysts expect him to announce a shift to Average Inflation Targeting, under which the Fed would let inflation run above its current 2% inflation target to make up for years of undershooting it. That means keeping interest rates lower for longer. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that it could mean no rate hikes for as much as five years.
Market speculation on the shift has contributed both to the dollar’s recent weakness and the strength of stocks, which typically enjoy the prospect of free money forever. Kansas City Fed President Esther George on Wednesday downplayed any threat to financial stability, saying it was more important to focus on the near-term health of the economy
2. Jobless claims, GDP revision due
The health of the economy will be on parade again at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) – before Powell speaks at 9:10 AM ET – with the weekly jobless claims numbers and a revision to the second-quarter data for Gross Domestic Product.
Initial jobless claims are expected at around 1 million again, down from 1.11 million last week, while continuing jobless claims are expected to have edged down by around 400,000 to 14.45 million. As always, the fuller picture will be in the number that also includes those claiming Pandemic Unemployment Assistance.
GDP is expected to be revised up slightly to a mere -32.5% in annualized terms from an initial reading of -32.9%. As UBS Global Wealth Management chief economist Paul Donovan argued in a morning note, the practise of annualizing such figures “is a silly thing to do at the best of times and borderline madness in the midst of a pandemic.”
3. Stocks set to open a tad lower, in holding pattern
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower ahead of Powell’s speech. Having bought the rumor of a shift to easier monetary policy, the temptation will be accordingly to sell the fact when it happens.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow 30 futures contract was down 89 points or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures were also down 0.2%. All three are likely to remain in a holding pattern at least until the economic data releases.
It’s a quiet day for corporate earnings, although Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) stock may garner attention after its rapid Covid-19 test became the latest beneficiary of fast-tracking by the Food and Drug Administration.
For those refusing to ignore the smaller details, there will also be the Kansas City Fed’s regional business survey at 9 AM ET and pending home sales data at 8AM ET.
4. Back to normal on U.S.-China relations
Having got over the need to say nice words in public about their trade relations, the U.S. and China got back to the daily tussle of riling and provoking each other. The U.S. announced a raft of sanctions on Chinese companies that have helped Beijing build military installations on disputed islands in the South China Sea.
That came on the same day that China tested its latest ‘aircraft-killer’ long-range missiles, in a show of force intended to keep U.S. warships out of waters that it claims.
Elsewhere, U.S. pressure on the Chinese owner of video-streaming service TikTok led to the resignation of TikTok’s chief executive Kevin Mayer, who had joined only a few months ago from Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS).
5. Oil prices well bid as Hurricane Laura hits Louisiana
Oil prices remained well supported as Hurricane Laura made landfall in Cameron, Louisiana, with life-threatening storm surges and winds.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down less than 0.1% at $43.37 a barrel, only a few cents off the post-pandemic high they posted on Wednesday. Brent crude was down 0.1% at $46.11.
Gasoline futures were off by 1.5% at $1.3405 a gallon, amid relief that refineries further west in Texas should be able to continue working.
While crude and product stocks are still historically high, Wednesday’s report from the U.S. government showed them still coming down a little faster than expected.

This year they can listen directly, because it will be conducted virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic and streamed live to the public for the first time.
Over the past two decades, central bankers have used the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole to plot out and signal changes in monetary policy.
With the global economy reeling from the virus and U.S. unemployment still above 10%, they can tune in as Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks at 9:10 a.m. Washington time Thursday on the central bank’s long-awaited framework review.
He’s expected to reinforce the case for aiming for inflation that hits a 2% target on average. That’s likely to see the central bank keep interest rates pinned at zero for five years, or possibly more.
Here are some highlights from recent gatherings of the central bank clan in Wyoming:
2019
Setting the stage for an interest rate cut, Powell warned of “significant risks” to the economic outlook and singled out uncertainty over trade policy as a factor holding back global growth. Though he didn’t mention Donald Trump by name, that didn’t stop the president from immediately attacking him on Twitter for keeping rates too high, including going so far as to ask whether Powell was a bigger enemy than Chinese President Xi Jinping.
2014
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi laid the groundwork for quantitative easing in his address, warning that inflation expectations had deteriorated and assuring his audience the ECB “will use all the available instruments needed to ensure price stability.” The ECB launched QE the following year and bought over 2.6 trillion euros of mostly government bonds.
2012
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled a third round of quantitative easing was on the table in his speech at Jackson Hole at which he defended the effectiveness of the Fed’s controversial bond purchases. Calling the costs of unconventional polices “manageable,” he said officials should not rule out their future use. The Fed launched QE3 the next month.
2008
As the financial crisis raged, Bernanke frequently left the formal conference proceedings to discuss market developments with key lieutenants, including Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn and New York Fed President and later Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. “We tried to remain inconspicuous by leaving the conference at different times,” Bernanke recalled in his 2015 memoir of the period.
2007
In his opening speech, Bernanke put an interest rate cut squarely on the table by recounting the toll that the slumping house market had taken on the economy and by stressing the importance of “well-functioning financial markets.” The central bank slashed rates by a half percentage point the following month, the first in a series that eventually lowered the Fed’s target to near zero.
2005
In a symposium mainly given over to extolling the record of departing Chairman Alan Greenspan, University of Chicago economist Raghuram Rajan warned about excessive risk-taking by asset managers seeking to boost their compensation. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers sharply criticized Rajan’s paper for its “slightly Luddite premise.” But Rajan, who went on to become governor of India’s central bank, proved to be prescient as financial markets were engulfed by turmoil a few years later.
1999
Then-Princeton University professor Bernanke and Mark Gertler of New York University made the case for the Fed pursuing a strategy of “flexible inflation targeting,” arguing that such an approach could achieve both macroeconomic and financial stability. In the event, the Fed did adopt a 2% inflation target in 2012, after Bernanke became chairman.

897,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 06:09AM ET</span>",Historic Economic Contraction in Canada Masks Strong Rebound,"(Bloomberg) -- Canada’s economy suffered its worst contraction on record in the second quarter, official data is set to show on Friday, but the country appears to have rebounded strongly since the height of the pandemic.
Economists anticipate gross domestic product shrank by nearly 40% on an annualized basis as businesses and companies cut spending sharply amid virus-related shutdowns. That adds to the 8.2% contraction in the first quarter.
It adds up to a bigger first-half hit than in the U.S., though Canada is expected to see a stronger recovery, having avoided a new wave of cases similar to the one that continues to hamper the expansion south of the border. Monthly data, also to be released on Friday, will probably show Canada has already recouped more of its lost output than the U.S. has.
“The economic recovery has been a little quicker to occur than expected,” said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada.
The unprecedented contraction reflects stricter containment measures imposed on businesses between March and May to curb the pandemic, along with a steep drop in oil prices that represented a double hit for the energy producing nation.
But oil prices have recovered, Canada’s housing market is booming again amid historically low interest rates, and the federal government has pledged to keep the fiscal taps open into the recovery period -- keeping disposable income elevated and consumers spending despite record high jobless numbers. Retail sales, for example, have already recovered to pre-pandemic levels.
Economists anticipate gross domestic product probably jumped 5.6% in June, after a 4.5% gain in May -- both record monthly expansions after historic declines in March and April. Statistics Canada is also expected to release a preliminary estimate for July that will show an economy that has made up well over half of the pandemic losses.
U.S. GDP shrank by nearly a third last quarter on an annualized basis. The European Union’s economy contracted by 39% and the U.K.’s by almost 60%, also on an annualized basis.
Fewer Cases
Unlike the U.S., Canada has been able to keep its Covid-19 cases relatively low and hasn’t had to backtrack any reopening plans. Daily new cases have been averaging around 400 in Canada in recent weeks, compared to near 2,000 at the height of the pandemic.
Still, Canada’s economy isn’t expected to fully make up the pandemic losses until 2022 in what’s anticipated to be a long and uneven recovery. The economy is projected to contract by 6.5% for all of this year, before a rebound of 4.8% in 2021, according to the latest survey of economists. That would leave real economic activity next year still about 2% below 2019 levels.
Canada has also had much larger job losses than other major advanced economies -- a hindrance to a full rebound in consumption, particularly once the initial bounce back in spending peters out. The federal government anticipates that 4.5 million people affected by the pandemic will continue receiving government support in coming months to compensate for lost work. High-frequency data is already showing a slowdown.
The resurgence of cases in the U.S. could also weigh on Canada’s recovery by slowing any rebound in exports -- which probably recorded a historic drop in the second quarter. Economists anticipate an almost 60% annualized decline in the sale of goods and services abroad in the period. The country sends about three-quarters of its exports to the U.S.

The former Latvian prime minister will take charge as the European Union seeks to ease trade tensions with the United States, seal a deal on future relations with Britain and unite around a new leader for the World Trade Organization.
Dombrovskis previously stood in for two weeks in June when Hogan said he was considering putting himself forward to become the next WTO director-general. He finally opted not to do so.
The Commission coordinates trade policy for the EU's 27 members, meaning the EU trade chief is among the most powerful of the ""college"" of commissioners.
Von der Leyen said the Irish government should propose a man and a woman as potential successors and she would later determine the final allocation of tasks. Ireland may not retain the trade portfolio.
Hogan quit late on Wednesday after days of pressure over allegations he had breached COVID-19 guidelines during a trip to Ireland, saying the controversy had become a distraction from his work.

Von der Leyen thanked Hogan for his work as commissioner for trade and previously for agriculture, but said she expected her team to be particularly vigilant about complying with national or regional coronavirus restrictions.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government upgraded its view on exports and output in August for the second straight month as global demand slowly improves, but authorities cautioned conditions were still severe due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The government left unchanged its overall assessment that the world's third-largest economy is ""showing signs of picking up"" after falling into a deep recession due to the health crisis.
""The Japanese economy remains in a severe situation due to the novel coronavirus, but it is showing signs of picking up recently,"" the government said in its economic report for August.
Authorities said the impact from policy steps at home and improvements in economic activity overseas led to hopes that the pickup in the economy will continue.
But they also cautioned that attention should be given to the risk that coronavirus infections would continue to weigh on domestic and overseas economies.
Data earlier this month showed Japan suffered its biggest economic slump on record in the second quarter as the coronavirus crisis hit corporate and household activity hard, knocking the size of real gross domestic product to decade-low levels.
While the economy is seen rebounding after lockdowns were lifted in late May, many analysts expect a recovery to pre-coronavirus levels will take time as a renewed rise in infections makes consumers cautious.
The more optimistic view on exports was underpinned by better economic activity among major trading partners, which especially helped boost U.S.-bound shipments of cars and car-related goods, the government said.
According to the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, world trade rose by 7.6% in June from May, but volumes were still well below pre-virus levels.
The improvement in exports also helped lead to a pickup in output among Japanese manufacturers and service-sector firms in June.

The government kept its assessment of the remaining components of the report unchanged.

900,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 04:16AM ET</span>",We share workers: Chinese factories redeploy staff to weather pandemic blow,"By Stella Qiu and Tony Munroe
BEIJING (Reuters) - When the government of the south China city of Zhongshan heard that watchmaker Kam Yuen Group was furloughing more than 100 workers, it brokered a deal to shift the surplus staff to another manufacturer - a growing practice
The arrangement will see Guangdong Welland Technology Co, which makes smart-watches and weighing scales, take on 140 Kam Yuen workers over the next six months.
Labour-sharing in China's export manufacturing heartland, prompted by the coronavirus pandemic that by some estimates cost up to 80 million Chinese jobs at its peak, forms part of a wider effort by Beijing to encourage more flexible work - including self-employment and part-time roles - to support jobs and maintain social stability.
""It is better to go to work than being put on leave, even as the hourly wages they receive could be somewhat lower than what they got paid before,"" said Wang Yaokun, human resources director at Hong Kong-based Kam Yuen, which had already lost 800-1,000 jobs in Zhongshan.
China's total workforce has shrunk slightly since 2017 to around 775 million last year, with the export sector employing about 180 million workers.
Chinese manufacturers have struggled in recent years to attract employees as the workforce ages and younger people eschew factory jobs. The pandemic has ravaged the economy and exacerbated imbalances, boosting makers of medical equipment as well as computers and mobiles for the many millions stuck at home even as traditional labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, toys and furniture see weak demand.
Under the agreement between Kam Yuen and Welland, employees seconded to Welland are still employed by Kam Yuen and will return to the company after a six-month stint, when Kam Yuen hopes business is better.
""We do not expect the business to completely recover until the end of year, as most of our orders are from the EU and Switzerland,"" Wang told Reuters.
Local governments across the export-focused provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been facilitating similar arrangements in recent months, with the central government endorsing the approach in nationwide guidelines issued in July.
In Dongguan, a major manufacturing hub, about 20,000 workers from 750 manufacturers have signed up to such schemes since February, according to Dongguan government.
In the high-tech industrial development zone of Heyuan city, home to over 300 industrial companies, more than 100 factories scaled back operations after the pandemic hit orders.
Through an employee-sharing programme launched in late May, over 3,000 workers have been redeployed, according to a local official who requested anonymity.
China forbids companies from earning a profit by leasing out their workers.
""Firms were first worried about legal arrangements of work injuries, staff poaching and the protection of commercial secrets, but through government mediation, they managed to reach an agreement,"" the official said.
These labour-sharing schemes are not unique to China. As the pandemic wipes out millions of jobs worldwide, some global corporations have redeployed surplus workers.
BEYOND COVID
In China, some industry and government officials say the schemes could outlast the pandemic shock.
Boyang Xue, North Asia analyst at consultancy DuckerFrontier, said ongoing risks of economic ""decoupling"" between the United States and China, a shrinking labour force and rising costs would drive more flexible work arrangements.
Lisheng Wang, a Hong Kong-based economist at Nomura, said workers' legal rights would need to be protected for such arrangements to succeed.
""For some industries with a low-entry barrier but different production cycles, employee-sharing could help increase labour utilization, reduce average labour costs, improve productivity and profitability, and increase workers' income,"" he said.
For example, the production peak for the electronics sector is usually in the fourth quarter, which differs from that of the textile industry.
 Darfon  Electronics Corp (TW:8163), a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer which owns a factory in China's Huaian city, has from March borrowed 200 workers from Jiangsu Canasin Weaving Co, a supplier of hotel linen, said Su Bohan, an investor relations official at Darfon.

""We have different production cycles, so we can share labour,"" Su said.

901,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 01:25AM ET</span>",Investors price for Fed chair to signal inflation can run higher,"By Karen Pierog and Ross Kerber
CHICAGO/BOSTON (Reuters) - Investors are awaiting a pivotal speech by U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell on Thursday, positioning for rates to be kept lower-for-longer and inflation to potentially run higher. 
Powell will speak in online remarks to the Kansas City Fed's annual economic symposium about the central bank's framework review, an initiative to explore how monetary policy should adapt to changes in the economy.
Low inflation and interest rates have made the Fed's conventional tools less powerful than before, and policymakers have been weighing whether to try to offset long periods of weak inflation with periods of higher inflation.
""I think the market is shifting gears and trying to position themselves for the likelihood that as Powell is speaking, that he'll say something that will lead investors to readjust their inflation expectations upward,"" said Jim Barnes, director of fixed income for Bryn Mawr Trust. 
Longer-dated treasury yields have moved higher this week as investors positioned themselves for higher inflation expectations, said Barnes.
The benchmark 10-year (US10YT=RR) yield was at 0.69% while the 30-year (US30YT=RR) was at 1.40% - both significantly higher than earlier in the month. Yields move inversely to prices and inflation erodes the value of longer-dated bonds.
The Fed's actions to cut rates, start some bond-buying, and approve massive lending programs have kept bond yields historically low.
Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer Global Wealth Management, UBS, wrote that the Fed keeping rates ""lower for longer"" meant cash and the safest bonds were likely to deliver negative real returns for the foreseeable future. 
Steven Englander, a managing director at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank said Powell is expected ""to convey ... reassurance that the commitments to easy money and above 2% inflation should be believed.""
Englander said he saw investors betting on inflation break-evens going higher, with the current level still well below any likely Fed target. 
The so-called break-even inflation rate for 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS)  closed at 1.74% on Wednesday, its highest closing point since mid-January, according to Tradeweb data. 
Meanwhile, the yield on 10-year TIPS (US10YTIP=RR), which are Treasury yields minus expected annual inflation, has dropped from a high so far this year of 0.710% in March to trade around the -1% level in recent days.
Analysts have also been noting for weeks the likelihood that the Fed will extend the duration of its asset buying to add more longer-term assets.

Housing markets and certain types of business investment are driven by long-term interest rates and such a move would seem to lower ""both the level and volatility of yields,"" wrote Englander.

902,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 01:21AM ET</span>","South Korea central bank cuts 2020 GDP outlook, open to more stimulus to fight virus fallout","By Cynthia Kim and Joori Roh
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank kept interest rates steady on Thursday, but sharply downgraded its 2020 growth outlook and kept the door open for more monetary stimulus to support an economy hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
The Bank of Korea kept the seven-day repurchase rate at a record low of 0.5% , in an unanimous and widely expected decision, after 75 basis points of rate cuts this year.
It said gross domestic product would likely shrink 1.3% in 2020 - the biggest contraction in more than two decades - from a previous forecast for a 0.2% decline.
Governor Lee Ju-yeol said monetary policy needed to be ""actively"" used if the downturn worsened, reiterating the central bank was open to more rate cuts and was willing to expand the use of other monetary tools.
""There is room to respond with rate cuts,"" Lee told a press conference livestreamed via Youtube. 
""That said, as base rate is at a considerably low level we will need to be cautious on that by reviewing the expected impact as well as adverse effects.""
He said the central bank was open to increasing bond purchases and carrying out open market operations but was, for now, not considering yield curve controls - a policy adopted by some central banks to hold down long-term interest rates.
""The negative growth of 1.3% outlook was somewhat shocking, (I) didn't think (the BOK) would be this drastic,"" said Yoon Yeo-sam, an economist at Meritz Securities.
September futures on three-year treasury bonds  initially rose, but later retreated as Lee sounded cautious about the possibility of more rate cuts.
The BOK is walking a tight rope as it tries to balance the need for more stimulus with the risk that further rate reductions may encourage more cheap borrowing and worsen a home buying frenzy. Property prices have risen rapidly, particularly in Seoul, despite several cooling measures.
The pandemic pushed South Korea's export-led economy into its worst recession in over 20 years and analysts worry this could drag into the third quarter as the government considers imposing the highest level of physical distancing.
Lee expected exports to rebound in the second half of the year but only gradually as global demand still recovers from the coronavirus fallout.
South Korea had been more successful than others in containing the virus, managing to avoid a full-blown lockdown, but suffered a setback this month with a church outbreak which spread to a political rally.

The policy review comes as the government and opposition are debating a fourth extra budget to bolster the 277 trillion won ($233.82 billion) worth fiscal stimulus pledged this year.

903,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 11:10PM ET</span>",Pandemic may push Japan banks' credit costs to crisis levels: BOJ's Suzuki,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese financial institutions may see credit costs balloon to levels hit during the global financial crisis if a resurgence in coronavirus infections hammer the economy, Bank of Japan (BOJ) board member Hitoshi Suzuki said.
Suzuki said the BOJ's massive stimulus programme was helping cushion the economic blow from the pandemic, with the benefits of ultra-loose policy still exceeding the costs.
But the strain on financial institutions from ultra-low rates could intensify as they respond to government requests to boost lending to firms hit by COVID-19, Suzuki warned.
""With the economy having lost momentum to achieve our price target due to the pandemic, our monetary easing will last even longer"" and would require the central bank to be more vigilant to the accumulating side-effects of its policy, Suzuki said.
""If a second and third wave of infection hits Japan, financial institutions' credit costs could balloon to levels near those hit after (the 2008) collapse of Lehman Brothers,"" he said in a speech in Asahikawa, northern Japan, on Thursday.
Japan has seen a resurgence in coronavirus infections after nationwide state of emergency measures ended in late May. The country has reported 64,904 cases in total and 1,230 deaths.
The BOJ has eased policy twice this year amid a deepening recession and created a lending facility to encourage banks to boost lending to firms hit by COVID-19.
But the massive loans backed by the BOJ and the government may squeeze financial institutions' margins further by weighing on lending rates, said Suzuki, a former commercial banker.
The impact of ultra-low interest rates on the economy may also be limited as companies pile up savings instead of boosting investment, he added.

Japanese companies' total internal reserves stood at a record 463 trillion yen ($4.37 trillion) in fiscal 2018, up 65% in the past decade, according to government data.

904,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 09:36PM ET</span>","Bank of Korea Holds Rate, Slashes GDP View as Virus Surges","(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Korea held its key interest rate amid mounting pressure on policy makers to take more action to ensure the resurgence of the coronavirus doesn’t derail the economy’s recovery.
The BOK maintained its seven-day repurchase rate at 0.5% on Thursday, a decision predicted by all 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The central bank also said it now expects the economy to shrink 1.3% this year, far worse than the 0.2% contraction it forecast in May. It sees inflation picking up slightly to 0.4%, from 0.3% earlier.
The hold underscores the balancing act facing the BOK, as it remains wary of adding stimulus that could further fuel property gains while the economic toll from the latest virus wave becomes evident. Governor Lee Ju-yeol said earlier this week the ongoing outbreak is the biggest risk to growth.
“The cut in the growth forecast speaks to falling demand,” said An Young-jin, an economist at SK Securities. “The elevation in the inflation projection, however, reflects gradual price increases among supply-side factors such as commodities and oil after some extreme slides earlier this year.”
South Korea’s 10-year bond yield declined 3 basis points to 1.38% as of 9:58 a.m. in Seoul after the central bank slashed its economic forecasts. The won gained 0.1% to 1,185.65 per dollar amid broad risk-on sentiment.
So far this year, the BOK has cut its benchmark rate by 75 basis points to blunt the impact of the pandemic, in addition to supplying liquidity and purchasing bonds to stabilize markets. The government has also implemented three extra budgets this year, the biggest stimulus of its kind on record.
Still, the BOK lowering its projection by a significant margin shows the bank sees stimulus falling short of offsetting the fallout from the global pandemic. The virus flareup at home and in its key trade partners, combined with floods that pounded parts of South Korea, have contributed to economists lowering their growth forecasts.
Korea Virus Wave Disrupts Recovery as Stronger Measures Eyed
How the BOK will respond should the economy worsen is a key focus for central bank watchers. The central bank sees the current rate as close to the effective lower bound, suggesting the bar for further rate cuts is high.
The bank has also been under fire from some lawmakers for providing liquidity that has aggravated a property bubble in parts of the country. Any further stimulus by the BOK would have to be carefully implemented as not to run counter to efforts by the government to curb property prices, including a series of regulations on home purchases and ownership.
Further Steps
Governor Lee has repeatedly said the bank was ready to turn to “unconventional” steps to stimulate the economy if necessary, without providing specifics.
While most analysts don’t expect the South Korean bank to adopt quantitative easing or yield curve control like some of its peers, it may step up bond purchases as prospects rise for more government debt issuances to fund emergency spending.

905,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 06:10PM ET</span>","Argentina steps toward next debt tango, with the IMF","By Adam Jourdan and Cassandra Garrison
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina, set to wrap up a $65 billion debt deal with creditors this week, has formally initiated talks to negotiate a new deal to replace its record standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund as it looks to escape from recession and default.
In a letter to IMF head Kristalina Georgieva on Wednesday, Argentina's Economy Minister Martin Guzman and central bank chief Miguel Angel Pesce requested formal talks that would lead to a new program to succeed the ""canceled and derailed 2018 stand-by arrangement.""
""The crisis that affects our country today was deepened by a quick agreement with the IMF in 2018, that was unsustainable, and carried out with its back to society,"" Guzman tweeted, adding it was vital to reschedule debt maturities with the fund.
The IMF agreed to float cash-strapped Argentina a $57 billion financing program two years ago, the biggest in the fund's history, under the previous administration of Mauricio Macri. Around $44 billion of that has already been lent.
Georgieva said in a statement that she had held a ""very constructive and positive conversation"" with Argentina's center-left Peronist President Alberto Fernandez and that the IMF was ready to ""support Argentina in these challenging times.""
Argentina's letter detailed the depth of its economic crisis and its efforts to prevent a further fall in output and employment, lower inflation and restore debt sustainability as it faces an estimated economic contraction of 12.5% this year. 
""We are determined to restart the process of pursuing a consistent fiscal path once the effects of the pandemic disappear,"" it said. 
Argentina's previous government faced a cash crunch two years ago after Macri's austerity drive, which included cuts to energy subsidies. Vendors raised consumer prices to help cover rising energy costs, fueling inflation.
Argentina earlier this month reached a preliminary agreement with creditors to restructure around $65 billion in foreign debt. Bondholders have until Aug. 28 to accept the offer, though all three major creditor groups have supported a deal.

In a separate statement, the government said Fernandez told Georgieva by phone that a new agreement should focus on economic recovery and solving pressing social problems.

906,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 06:06PM ET</span>","U.S. targets Chinese individuals, companies amid South China Sea dispute","By Susan Heavey, Daphne Psaledakis and David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday blacklisted 24 Chinese companies and targeted individuals it said were part of construction and military actions in the South China Sea, its first such sanctions move against Beijing over the disputed strategic waterway.
The U.S. Commerce Department said the two dozen companies played a ""role in helping the Chinese military construct and militarize the internationally condemned artificial islands in the South China Sea."" 
Separately, the State Department said it would impose visa restrictions on Chinese individuals ""responsible for, or complicit in,"" such action and those linked to China's ""use of coercion against Southeast Asian claimants to inhibit their access to offshore resources.""
The companies blacklisted included Guangzhou Haige Communications Group, several firms that appear to be related to the China Communications Construction Co, as well as Beijing Huanjia Telecommunication, Changzhou Guoguang Data Communications, China Electronics Technology Group Corp and China Shipbuilding Group.
It was the latest U.S. move to crack down on firms whose goods may support Chinese military activities and comes in the run up to the Nov. 3 U.S. election, in which both President Donald Trump and rival Joe Biden have been sharply critical of China.
The United States accuses China of militarizing the South China Sea and trying to intimidate Asian neighbors who might want to exploit its extensive oil and gas reserves. 
U.S. warships have gone through the area to assert the freedom of access to international waterways, raising fears of clashes.
A U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters that on Wednesday China launched four medium-range ballistic missiles that hit the South China Sea between Hainan Island and the Paracel Islands.
The official added that an assessment was underway to determine the type of missile launched. 
The Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post newspaper quoted a source close to the Chinese military as saying that China had launched two missiles, including an “aircraft-carrier killer”, into the South China Sea on Wednesday morning in a warning to the United States.
China complained that the United States had sent a U-2 reconnaissance plane into a no-fly zone over Chinese live-fire military drills on Tuesday.
The Pentagon said a U-2 flight conducted in the Indo-Pacific region was ""within the accepted international rules and regulations governing aircraft flights.""
The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately reply to a request for comment on U.S. announcements, but in July, Beijing said it was not afraid of any sanctions the United States might impose and accused it of stirring up trouble and destabilizing the region.
Washington warned last month it could respond with sanctions against Chinese officials and enterprises involved in coercion in the South China Sea after it announced a tougher stance rejecting Beijing's claims to offshore resources there as ""completely unlawful.""
China claims virtually all of the potentially energy-rich South China Sea, but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to parts of an area through which about $3 trillion of trade passes each year.
""This is the first time the U.S. has levied any type of economic sanction against Chinese entities for behavior in the South China Sea,"" said Greg Poling, a South China Sea expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.
""It probably doesn’t make much impact on those entities directly - I doubt that there is much CCCC needs to buy from the U.S. that it can’t get from other suppliers. And these certainly aren’t the financial sanctions that some might have expected ... But it could be a start at trying to convince Southeast Asian partners that the new policy is more than just rhetoric.""
Messages left with CCCC, a transport and infrastructure conglomerate, the Shanghai Cable Offshore Engineering Co Ltd, an engineering company that specializes in submarine cables, and Guangzhou Haige Communication Group, which manufactures communications equipment, were not immediately returned after business hours in China. Several other firms on the list could not immediately be reached or could not immediately be located. 
The Commerce Department said it was adding the 24 firms to its ""entity list,"" which restricts sales of U.S. goods shipped to them and some more limited items made abroad with U.S. content or technology. Companies can apply for licenses to make the sales, but they must overcome a high bar for approval.
The State Department did not name those subject to visa bans, but a senior department official told reporters “dozens” of individuals would be subject to the restrictions. A senior Commerce Department official said U.S. exports to the Chinese companies targeted had been relatively small - about $5 million in the last five years.

The actions follow a blueprint used by Washington in its attempt to limit the influence of Huawei Technologies Co for what it says are national security reasons.

907,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 06:06PM ET</span>",Exclusive: France creates reform roadmap for crisis-ridden Lebanon,"By Laila Bassam
BEIRUT (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron has created a roadmap for Lebanese politicians outlining political and financial reforms needed to unlock foreign aid and rescue the country from multiple crises including an economic meltdown, according to a document seen by Reuters.
The two-page ""concept paper"" was delivered by the French ambassador to Beirut, a Lebanese political source said. A diplomatic source at Macron's Elysee office said no document has been given to Lebanese parties. A French Foreign Ministry official declined comment. 
The necessary measures include an audit of the central bank, appointment of an interim government capable of enacting urgent reforms, and early legislative elections within a year.
Lebanon's now-caretaker government, which took office in January with the support of the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement and its allies, failed to make progress in talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout due to inaction on reforms and a dispute over the size of financial losses.
The government resigned over this month's huge Beirut port explosion that killed at least 180 people, injured some 6,000 and destroyed entire neighbourhoods, and renewed protests against a political elite over endemic corruption and mismanagement that has led to a deep financial crisis.
""The priority must go to the rapid formation of a government, to avoid a power vacuum which will leave Lebanon to sink further into the crisis,"" the French paper reads. 
It lists four sectors in need of immediate attention: humanitarian aid and the authorities' response to the COVID-19 pandemic; reconstruction after the Aug. 4 blast; political and economic reforms and an early parliamentary election.
It also called for progress in IMF talks and United Nations oversight on international humanitarian funds pledged to Lebanon in recent weeks, as well as an impartial investigation into the cause of the detonation of vast amounts of highly explosive material stored unsafely at the port for years.
Macron visited Beirut shortly after the blast and made it clear that no blank cheques would be given to the Lebanese state if it did not enact reforms against waste, graft and negligence. 
Since then, he has held multiple phone calls with major political leaders under the country's sectarian power-sharing system, a Lebanese political source said. Macron is due to return to Beirut on Sept. 1.
Political rivalries and factional interests have prevented the formation of a new government able to tackle the financial crisis that has ravaged the currency, paralysed the banking system and spread poverty.
The French concept paper stresses the need for an immediate and full audit of state finances and reform of the power sector, which bleeds public funds while failing to provide adequate electricity.
Parliament should enact laws needed to effect change in the interim period, it said. ""Factions must be engaged to vote on the key measures that the new government will take in the next few months.""
The roadmap could deepen France's role in Lebanon, a former French colony.

The paper states that Paris will play a major role in rebuilding Beirut port, bolster healthcare, send teams from its treasury and central bank to support the financial audit, and help organise early parliamentary voting, along with the European Union.

While the coronavirus will still likely saddle Air China (OTC:AIRYY) Ltd., China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) Corp. and China Southern Airlines Co. with losses for the latest quarter, financial statements from the so-called Big 3 may point to a nascent recovery in air travel thanks to demand in their vast domestic market.
July traffic figures were promising, with passenger numbers for the three airlines rising about 25% from June as travel within China picked up. The trio flew a total of 22 million passengers domestically last month, more than 500 times as many flown at all by Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd., which has no home market to fall back on. Revenue passenger kilometers also jumped, though the numbers remain far below a year ago, pre-pandemic.
After being the first hit by Covid-19, which erupted in Wuhan in January, China is emerging from the crisis; it’s the only major economy on track to expand this year. Businesses have reopened and people are traveling again after the government eased restrictions on movement, including for inter-provincial group tours. The FTSE China A 600 Travel & Leisure Index has climbed about 60% in three months.
Popular Chinese destinations include Jiuzhaigou, famous for its colorful lakes, and Yangshuo and cities such as Chengdu, Shanghai and Beijing. Some places are receiving almost three times the number of visitors than last quarter,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) analysts led by Parash Jain wrote in a note dated Aug. 17, citing Trip.com data. Hotels have also become busier after the curbs were lifted. Occupancy rates in Shanghai reached 65.8% in the Aug. 9-15 week compared with just 6% in February, state-run China Daily reported Monday, citing the local government.
“This should boost load factors further and allow airlines to improve yields, a key profit driver,” Jain said, noting that Chinese carriers generate most profit on domestic routes. “Domestic traffic has been consistently showing signs of a recovery, while international traffic has still to take off meaningfully due to hurdles from travel restrictions and quarantine requirements,” he said.
Some carriers including China Eastern have offered ticket deals that allow unlimited flights, sacrificing some of their bottom line to lure customers back. OAG Aviation Worldwide said scheduled capacity in Asia’s biggest economy reached 15.6 million seats this week, only around 8% lower than toward the end of January when the outbreak began. By contrast, U.S. capacity is still down 43.1% from January at 11.8 million seats.
Jain said passenger capacity could grow this month compared with August last year, a striking turnaround given how hard the virus hit. The damage has been so grave that the International Air Transport Association doesn’t expect the world’s airlines to recover to pre-pandemic levels before 2024.
While the July traffic reports from the Big 3 showed an improvement at home, their international passenger traffic was still down 96% or more from a year earlier. The carriers also took a beating in the first quarter with a combined loss of 14 billion yuan ($2 billion) and, according to Jain, they’re headed for a full-year loss of 24.2 billion yuan.
Cheap Jet Fuel
Second-quarter figures, which the three are due to release Friday, should show an improvement from January-March thanks to higher passenger traffic and the yuan’s resilience against the dollar, Jain said.
Lower oil prices could also help numb some of the pain. Jet fuel fell to less than $20 a barrel in May and is likely to average $45 in 2020, according to Paul Yong, a Singapore-based aviation analyst at DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) Holdings Ltd.
“With revenue from domestic routes making up about two-thirds of total revenue for China’s Big 3 and with relatively low jet fuel prices, this should help them outperform their Asian peers that have higher international route exposure,” Yong said.
Yong has buy ratings on the Hong Kong-listed shares of all three carriers, as well as the mainland-listed stock of Air China and China Eastern. He has a hold recommendation on China Southern’s Shanghai-listed shares. The Big 3 are overwhelmingly rated buy or equivalent by analysts tracked by Bloomberg.
Shanghai-based Spring Airlines Co. has also had a strong run on the stock market, outperforming all others on a gauge of carriers in the Asia-Pacific region with a gain of 23% so far this quarter. The budget airline is also due to report earnings at the end of this week.

909,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 05:06PM ET</span>",Brazil's Bolsonaro and economy minister split over welfare spending,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro said on Wednesday he had rejected a proposal by his Economy Minister Paulo Guedes for a new cash welfare program called ""Renda Brasil"" because it would involve cutting other social programs.
The disagreement highlights the split between Guedes, who is struggling to keep Brazil's fiscal deficit under control, and a president whose popularity and re-election chances have risen thanks to the financial assistance distributed during the coronavirus pandemic.
The two are also at odds over the government's plan to extend emergency pandemic payments to low-paid and informal workers until the end of the year, currently 600 reais ($106) per month, which the minister wants to cut to under 200 reais.
The rift sent the Brazilian currency down 1.5% against the dollar and saw the Bovespa index in Sao Paulo fall 2.2% by mid-afternoon. 
The Economy Ministry issued a statement quashing speculation that Guedes was planning to quit.
Brazil's emergency pandemic payments, known as the ""coronavoucher,"" has benefited 30 million households, or 44% of the country's total, since March.
Recent opinion polls show these payments were a key factor in boosting the popularity of right-wing Bolsonaro to its highest since taking office last year, especially in the poorest region, northeastern Brazil, once a stronghold of the left.
But Guedes has said the pandemic handouts cost the Treasury 50 billion reais a month and are fiscally unsustainable.
To hold on to his newfound support, Bolsonaro is seeking to rebrand Bolsa Familia, the popular cash transfer program launched in 2003 by former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, which helped build a bastion of support for his Workers' Party. 
Renamed Renda Brasil, Bolsonaro hopes to expand the welfare payments to an additional 7 million poor families, taking it to a total of 21 million, and to increase the stipend.
But the president said he was unhappy with the way the Economy Ministry had proposed funding Renda Brasil, via cuts in other social programs such as the salary allowance scheme that many low-paid workers qualify for.
Bolsa Familia, which enjoys widespread popularity and support, costs the Treasury around 30 billion reais ($5.5 billion) a year.

""I can't take from the poor to give to the poor. I cannot take away 12 million people's salary allowance to give to a Bolsa Familia or Renda Brasil, or whatever,"" Bolsonaro said at an event in the state of Minas Gerais.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - A group of former Latin American heads of state has joined a chorus of demands to delay a vote on who will head the region's main development finance lender, part of growing opposition to the first-ever U.S. candidate.
Postponing the Sept. 12 vote for a new Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) president would be the ""politically sensible"" thing to do, the leaders said in a letter seen by Reuters.
The letter was signed by six former presidents and prime ministers, including Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, and Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico, as well as Felipe González of Spain.
U.S. President Donald Trump's nomination of his senior Latin America adviser Maurico Claver-Carone has sparked controversy because he would be the first person from outside the region to head the IDB, which provided about $12 billion in lending last year.
The opposition also reflects concerns that Trump could lose the Nov. 3 U.S. election, and his candidate could find it difficult to work with a Democratic administration.
The letter said moving forward with the scheduled vote would cause ""irreparable"" damage to the bank.
""It would be an arbitrary imposition that we have no doubt would have very negative consequences for the future of the institution and the future of the relationship between the United States and Latin America,"" the letter said.
The IDB declined to comment.
Claver-Carone, known for his hardline stance on Cuba and Venezuela, has said he has the support of at least 17 of the bank's 28 regional member countries - enough to win.
However, Argentina, Mexico, Costa Rica, Chile, a top EU official and a host of former regional leaders have all urged a delay.
Argentina and Costa Rica have said they plan to nominate their own candidates, though Claver-Carone is still the only official candidate ahead of a Sept. 10 deadline to submit names, an IDB official said on Wednesday.
The opposition to Claver-Carone, which represents an estimated 22% of the vote, could thwart the election if they can sway enough members to garner 25% - the threshold for blocking a quorum and delaying the ballot. The percentage of voting control relates to each country's shares in the bank.
Members including Peru, Canada, Japan and some European nations could prove to be key deciders.
A foreign ministry official in Peru, which controls about 1.5% of the vote, said its decision was ""still under evaluation.""
Canada, which holds about 4% of the vote, was ""closely following the process"" and supports ""a fair, transparent and merit-based election at the IDB,"" a foreign ministry spokeswoman told Reuters.
Germany, which accounts for just under 2%, has also yet to publicly endorse a candidate or weigh in on a delay, but a spokeswoman at its U.S. embassy said the government hopes to see at least two candidates in the running.
""Germany expects an open, transparent, inclusive, timely and competitively based process,"" she said. ""A suitable candidate must convince all shareholders – regional and non-regional - during the selection process.""

911,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>","Trump could act unilaterally to avoid U.S. airline layoffs, White House says","By David Morgan and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is weighing executive action to avoid massive layoffs at U.S. airlines if Congress fails to agree a fresh coronavirus stimulus package, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said on Wednesday.
His remarks came a day after American Airlines (O:AAL) said its workforce will shrink by 40,000, including 19,000 involuntary cuts, in October without an extension of government aid as the pandemic continues to devastate travel demand.
""If Congress is not going to work, this president is going to get to work and solve some problems. So hopefully, we can help out the airlines and keep some of those employees from being furloughed,"" Meadows said in an interview with Politico. 
He suggested, however, that assistance would require legislative action, saying: ""It would take a CARES package, I believe, to do it,"" referring to the $3 trillion coronavirus relief package that Congress passed earlier this year. 
Airline shares were lower in early trading (DJUSAR).
U.S. airlines received $25 billion in payroll aid under the CARES Act to protect jobs through October and the industry has lobbied for another $25 billion to keep workers employed through March, when they hope travel demand will be stronger.
Meadows said he had spoken with officials from American, as well as from United Airlines (O:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL).
""We will continue to work with the administration and our bipartisan supporters in Congress and hope to come to a resolution in a timely fashion,"" American said in a statement.
United has warned that 36,000 jobs are at risk. Delta said Monday that it would furlough 1,941 pilots but has not detailed cuts across other employee groups.
""Executive orders will not save our jobs,"" said Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA told union members at 19 airlines including United.
""It will definitely take Congress acting to keep all of the job requirements in place,"" she said on Twitter, while adding: ""Good to see WH wants to restart talks.""
Talks between Meadows, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer ended in early August, with top Democrats and the administration far apart on new legislation. 

""Unfortunately, COVID-19 continues to spread and wreak havoc on our industry, and demand for air travel has not returned as anticipated,"" the main industry lobby A4A said in a statement, pointing to a challenging fall as airlines prepare to cut jobs and service without additional aid.

""Progress toward a full recovery in economic activity may well be slow and uneven,"" Bowman said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Kansas Bankers Association. ""The Federal Reserve will continue to monitor progress and respond promptly and flexibly to support the recovery."" 
To help shape her understanding of the outlook, Bowman said she is in the process of speaking individually with every CEO of 650 Fed-supervised community banks across the country. 
The pandemic ""continues to weigh heavily on our national economy,"" she said, and community banks remained well-positioned to help support the recovery.

913,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 10:54AM ET</span>",Meadows Predicts No Stimulus Deal Until End of September,"(Bloomberg) -- White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows predicted there will be no stimulus deal with Congress until the end of September, and sought to blame House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the delay.
“If we got back in the room with some of their priorities, we could cut a deal -- the president wants to do that. But I’m not optimistic,” Meadows said in an interview with Politico on Wednesday. Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said by email that the speaker’s position remains that to restart talks the White House “must meet us halfway” between the top-line numbers on the package.
Meadows said he thought Pelosi would look to combine stimulus with the stopgap continuing resolution needed to prevent a Oct. 1 shutdown of federal agencies -- something she’s repeatedly argued against. Meadows said he’d favor such a combination, but would like to see it pass sooner rather than later.
“I think the speaker is going to hold out until the end of September and try to get what she wants in the funding for the government in the CR or whatever funding mechanism happens to come up at the end of September,” Meadows said.
Democrats continue to offer a $1 trillion reduction in their proposal if the White House bumps theirs by $1 trillion, Hammill said. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had initially sought $3.4 trillion in relief, with Republicans at $1 trillion.
Sticking Points
The two sides have been at impasse over the next virus relief bill since talks broke off on Aug. 7. Aid to state and local governments and the level of supplemental unemployment insurance have been the biggest sticking points -- with Democrats seeking $915 billion for regional authorities and a $600 per week added benefit, significantly beyond what Republicans favor.
President Donald Trump has since implemented a new temporary $300 per week federal unemployment benefit using a limited amount of disaster relief funds. The program is proving difficult to implement, however, and is expect to run out of funds in a little more than a month.
Meadows on Saturday tried to have an impromptu meeting with Pelosi while she was in the Capitol and went with his entourage to her suite, only to be told she was in a meeting. He said Wednesday that he had aides reach out to her staff on Tuesday.
The stimulus delays come as economists are increasingly warning that the U.S. risks a prolonged recession if Congress doesn’t provide $1 trillion to $2 trillion in relief funds this fall. That’s even with continued Federal Reserve monetary support.
Yellen Warning
“When unemployment is exceptionally high and inflation is historically low, as they both are now, the economy needs more fiscal spending to support hiring,” former Fed Chair Janet Yellen wrote with economist Jared Bernstein in the New York Times on Monday. Congress “cannot expect the Fed to keep everything together on its own,” they wrote.
Senate Republicans, meanwhile, are actively preparing for the possibility of combining talks on regular government funding with those on stimulus. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has circulated a discussion draft of a slimmed-down stimulus bill that would extend $300 per week in unemployment benefits through December.
One Republican lawmaker told reporters Tuesday that he’s participated in conference calls about the stimulus bill, and that there has been no movement in the drive for a relief package since the beginning of the August recess. Republicans, the lawmaker said, remain divided about the best approach, with the matter of how to handle the extra jobless benefits remaining a key issue for many. Democrats also appear to remain very dug in, the lawmaker said.
The Senate isn’t scheduled to return to Washington until Sept. 8, with the full House returning for votes the following week.
Before then, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is set to testify at Congress next Tuesday for the first time since negotiations stalled. That’s at a hearing of the House’s special Oversight subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, the panel announced.

ZURICH (Reuters) - The 2021 Davos World Economic Forum (WEF) summit of business leaders and politicians has been called off for January due to the coronavirus pandemic, with organisers planning to reschedule the event to sometime early next summer.
""The advice from experts is that we cannot (host the event) safely in January,"" WEF said on Wednesday in a statement.
The confab in the Swiss Alps that has hosted rival heads of state including U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in recent years has been held in the Swiss ski resort of Davos since 1971.
WEF, which takes over the ski resort of Davos for about a week each year, has branded itself as the world's top venue for the business and political elite to meet and discuss the challenges of globalisation.
The group said the decision to delay this year's edition ""was not taken easily, since the need for global leaders to come together to design a common recovery path and shape the 'Great Reset' in the post-COVID-19 era is so urgent.""

In lieu of the meeting, it would host virtual 'high-level' discussions the week of January 25, WEF said, adding it would share dates and location of the rescheduled meeting once it was assured of health and safety conditions.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Luxury watchmakers Bulgari and Breitling and a handful of Swiss brands are gathering in Geneva this week for a scaled-down industry exhibition, braving the coronavirus pandemic to try to revitalise demand.
The big Swiss watch fairs in Basel and Geneva, which usually attract thousands of visitors, were cancelled earlier this year because of the virus.
This week's gathering, the first of what will be known as ""Geneva Watch Days"", will be very different. Instead of using a big exhibition centre, the event will be spread over a number of the city's luxury hotels. 
Jean-Christophe Babin, the boss of Bulgari (PA:LVMH), who devised the new format to help to ""rekindle the flame"", said the new setting along with strict hygiene rules would help to prevent infection. 
""It is important to physically meet our customers,"" Babin told Reuters in an phone interview. ""We hope the event will help us gain market share.""
""This is sending a strong signal that we are determined to grow whatever happens.""
Bulgari expects about 60 retailers and 100 journalists, bloggers and influencers to attend.
Demand for luxury watches has collapsed during the pandemic as the Chinese, the industry's biggest customers, could not travel or shop.
Swiss watch exports plunged 68% in May, but the downturn slowed in June and July as mainland Chinese started shopping again.
But Babin said global demand was not back to pre-crisis levels with the virus still very present in North and Latin America. South Korea and mainland China had rebounded nicely, but not enough to make up for declines in America and Europe, he said.
Georges Kern, CEO of Breitling, said on a webcast on Wednesday: ""Luckily we are now seeing some of our markets return to a new normal and sales are bouncing back as well.""
Edouard Meylan, chief executive of H.Moser & Cie, said sales of his brand were only down 2% so far this year and demand was encouraging, but he was worried about some of his suppliers. 
""We depend on suppliers for cases, dials, straps, and some of them could go out of business because big brands cut their orders, also for next year,"" he said.
Babin said Bulgari might buy strategic suppliers, notably in jewellery, if that became necessary.
Rapidly changing quarantine rules in Europe have had an impact on this week's event. 

Babin said visitors from Spain and Belgium had cancelled due to quarantine regulations. But retailers and media from elsewhere in Europe were coming, plus also quite a few people from the United Arab Emirates.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - SoftBank-backed used car platform Kavak is expanding from Mexico into Argentina in a merger with secondhand auto company Checkars after seeing sales recover from a pandemic-induced dip, Kavak Chief Executive Carlos Garcia said in an interview on Tuesday.
Although Kavak's sales in Mexico fell 28% in April from the prior year, they recovered to pre-pandemic levels in June and began to pull even higher in August.
As part of the move into its first market outside Mexico, Kavak, an online platform for buying and selling secondhand cars, will invest $10 million in Argentina.
Buenos Aires-based Checkars, founded in 2018, has recorded 1,500 transactions and last year posted $8 million in sales, Kavak said in a statement. Checkars confirmed the details of the deal. 
As well as ensuring a smooth merger, Garcia's next challenge is to boost inventory.
That's both to grab a bigger share of the used car market - which he says is worth $60 billion in Mexico and $20 billion in Argentina - and to meet rising demand from budget-conscious shoppers hit by the pandemic, a trend already documented in the United States. 
""Now with the pandemic, economics are more important for customers than ever,"" Garcia said.
His plan is to offer 20,000 used autos in Mexico in the next 12 months, up from 2,000 now available.
Some buyers come from households that already have one car, and opt for a second as an alternative to the subways and buses where passengers are more vulnerable to picking up the virus, he noted.
Garcia declined to state how much funding Kavak has raised, but said Japanese investor SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), which is aiming to deploy up to $5 billion in Latin America, has brought a global perspective to the four-year-old startup.

“I have never thought of 2% as a ceiling but to really stay focused on what anchors inflation expectations in the economy,” George said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Michael McKee broadcast Wednesday, on the eve of her bank’s annual policy symposium, usually held in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. “From a communications standpoint, I think we will be talking about the kinds of things that help us do a better job of achieving our objectives.”
The prestigious conference, usually located in the magnificent Grand Teton National Park, will be held this year via video conference over two days due to the coronavirus pandemic. Chair Jerome Powell will kick off proceedings at 9:10 a.m. Washington time on Thursday with a speech on the Fed’s long-awaited framework review.
Mild Overshoot
The Fed is wrapping up discussion of changes to its monetary policy strategy that are expected to include a more explicit acknowledgment that central bankers would welcome the inflation rate rising over 2% that would result in meeting their goal on average over some time frame.
The conference will discuss challenges for monetary policy over the next decade. While an exact list of panels and speakers won’t be published until Wednesday evening, George said topics would include “low interest rates, slow growth, what uncertainty means to the process of policy making -- all of those of course have now been amplified by the events of a global pandemic.”
George has sometimes dissented in favor of tighter monetary policy and doesn’t vote this year. While she didn’t specifically back the average inflation target idea, the central banker made it clear she’s not worried about the prospect of higher price pressures now.
Deflationary Forces
“Importantly, what we see today are really, generally deflationary kinds of forces,” she said. “So until demand comes back, until we see the economy regain its footing, it’s hard to see in the near term. There is a lot of stimulus that may be out there at the point that the economy regains its footing. Today is probably not that day.”
George said the course of the virus will affect how quickly the economy recovers, echoing the most recent Federal Open Market Committee statement. She pointed out some businesses and consumers have pulled back in response to a resurgence in part of the U.S. in the past two months.
“It’s very clear that the foundation to a solid recovery is going to depend on addressing the virus first,” George said.
One of the Fed’s most prominent lending programs, its Main Street facility for smaller and medium-sized businesses, has gotten off to a slow start, but George said she’s optimistic it will become a bigger recourse for borrowers.
“That I think is going to be an important credit facility going forward,” she said. “When you think about the pressures that small business may be under in the months ahead, I think this could prove to be one of the options that they turn to.”

GDP fell 17.1% in April to June, from the previous three-month period in a seasonally adjusted terms. In annual terms, the economy contracted 18.7% in the second quarter compared to a year earlier.
Measures to contain the spread of coronavirus, which has infected 568,621 people and killed 61,450 in Mexico, shut factories, kept shoppers and tourists at home and upended trade.
A breakdown of the seasonally adjusted quarterly data showed primary activities slipped 2.0%, secondary activities plummeted 23.4% and tertiary activities contracted 15.1%.
Primary activities include farming and fishing, secondary activities consider manufacturing, mining and construction, and tertiary activities cover retail and the services sector.
Mexico's economy is forecast to contract by as much as 10.5% this year, in what the finance ministry and the central bank have said would be its worst recession since the 1930s Great Depression.

921,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Laggard banks told COVID-19 no excuse to delay beefing up EU Brexit hubs,"By Huw Jones and Sinead Cruise
LONDON (Reuters) - Banks in the UK are coming under growing pressure from regulators to get their new hubs in the European Union up and running even as COVID-19 and foot-dragging by clients disrupt Brexit relocation plans, banks and regulators say. 
Unfettered direct access to the EU for Britian's financial services sector, worth around 26 billion pounds ($34.19 billion)a year, ends on Dec. 31 and few bankers are betting on an extension. 
More than 60 banks in London have set up or expanded operations in the bloc, think tank New Financial has calculated but with just four months to go, not all are ready.
""Many institutions in the EU are too small to be viable and are not doing a lot of business yet as clients want to remain connected to deep liquidity in London,"" said John Liver, a partner at EY, which is advising banks on their Brexit plans.
But he added that regulators were hardening their ""encouragement"" for banks to move the ""centre of gravity"" of their euro-denominated business from London and demonstrate the viability of new continental hubs. 
Given several near-miss hard Brexits already, some banks have delayed moving people and causing unnecessary disruption for teams and their families, a source at one global bank said.
The unexpected success of remote working during the pandemic has also raised the question of whether as many bankers, traders, risk managers and support staff need to cross the Channel once the transition period ends. 
""We are wondering why EU regulators need all those people to be physically on the ground in the EU when they can comply with the rules of EU from anywhere,"" the banking source said.
""The pandemic has highlighted how political this issue is.""
MIND AND MANAGEMENT 
With no possibility of direct EU-wide access from January, banks in Britain will have to rely on a patchy web of bilateral agreements with national regulators.
The European Banking Authority, the bloc's banking watchdog, said it understood the impact of COVID-19 on Brexit plans but hubs still needed to be ready before January.
""The pandemic has created challenges in some of the plans and some adjustments have been agreed, but the overall principles remain the same,"" said Piers Haben, director of banking markets, innovation and consumers at the European Banking Authority (EBA).
""The mind and management of the bank must be in the single market,"" he added.
A second international banking source said clients were in no rush because they can switch business between jurisdictions at relatively short notice, but staff dealing with EU clients, either from the office or home, must be based in the bloc from January because that is where they will be authorised and taxed.
With COVID-19 knocking the economy and clients' operations, there are also questions about the financial sense of running a UK and an EU hub.
The new hubs want to know how long European Central Bank supervisors will allow ""back-to-back"" booking, where banks can record EU trading and service activities centrally in London to avoid duplicating costs, the second banker said.
""Everyone is working on the assumption we are on a path to ending it but not yet; a planned programme rather than a guillotine in January.""
A spokeswoman for the European Central Bank said some banks had hit target operating models already or were on track to but others were falling short of expectations.
""The ECB stresses that this is not about moving assets and staff alone. It is also about aiming to be structurally profitable, being operationally self-standing in key areas and most importantly not excessively reliant on back-to-back booking to the parent.""

922,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>","Framework review complete, Fed's Powell starts hard sell for higher inflation","By Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - After a nearly two-year review, U.S. Federal Reserve officials feel they've hit on a better way to meet their key goals of steady inflation and maximum employment.
On Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell begins what may be the tougher task: convincing the public that the central bank can and will deliver in the wake of a pandemic that has arguably eroded trust in U.S. institutions and put a huge chunk of the labor force on the unemployment rolls.
It is a hard sell on a confusing topic - the thrust involves telling Americans that higher inflation will be good for them in the long run - and analysts have already begun second-guessing whether a new Fed ""framework"" will fare any better than the current one in an environment where monetary policy may be nearing the limit of what it can do to help the economy.
""The situation is really perilous right now and there is little that monetary policymakers at this point have left in their arsenal,"" said David Wilcox, former head of the Fed's research division and now a senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics.
Wilcox said he feared the Fed's new framework, expected to be unveiled soon, will seem abstract unless it is coupled with new steps to enforce it, such as massive new bond-buying or the setting of explicit unemployment goals. 
The minutes from the Fed's last policy meeting indicated those steps may be coming further down the road, giving the central bank time to see how the economy behaves at this stage of the coronavirus pandemic. It has already chopped interest rates to zero, started some bond-buying, and approved massive lending programs.
Powell, in online remarks on Thursday to the Kansas City Fed's annual economic symposium, will speak about the central bank's framework review, an initiative that included public hearings and research to explore how monetary policy should adapt to changes in the economy. 
Normally held at the mountain resort of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, but being conducted virtually this year because of the pandemic, the symposium has been used in the past by Fed chiefs to signal policy shifts, and that will be the expectation when Powell begins speaking at 9:10 a.m. EDT (1310 GMT) on Thursday.
Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida and Fed Governor Lael Brainard also are scheduled to speak next week in events sponsored by think tanks in Washington.
MISSED TARGET 
The topic may seem deep in the weeds of monetary policy, centered on convictions that weak inflation and low rates of unemployment can't coexist because wages and prices spiral if too many people are working.
Until the pandemic, however, they had. Unemployment crept to historically low levels without inflation even hitting the Fed's 2% target. Expectations about inflation, considered key to the future pace of price hikes, also lagged.
That has become a chronic problem not only for the Fed but for central bankers around the world. Without some inflation, interest rates remain lower than normal, and that affords little room to help the economy by reducing them when recessions hit, as happened this year. Central banks are then faced with cutting rates quickly to zero and using politically more difficult tools like bond-buying or credit programs to support businesses and families. 
""There is a growing realization that a 2% inflation target as originally put in place in the U.S. and around the world is not quite enough,"" St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said in a recent interview with Reuters. Changing the framework could help ""shore up the target and get expectations to stay at 2%,"" he said.
The Fed first put the inflation target in place in 2012, and has missed it most of the time since. Financial markets indicate the expected U.S. inflation rate 10 years out is just 1.75%, a level reflecting little worry about the risk of a jump in inflation and little faith in the Fed's sway over the one economic variable a central bank is thought to control. 
At its policy meeting next month, the Fed is expected to change how it characterizes its inflation goal. Instead of looking to achieve 2% inflation on an annual basis, it is expected to aim to achieve that level as an average over a longer time, and explicitly allow perhaps years of faster price increases to make up for years when prices rose too slowly.
It would take, for example, a decade of 2.5% inflation to offset the target shortfalls since 2012.
'COMPLETE NIGHTMARE'
The new framework is expected to also take greater account of the key lesson of the last few years: Unemployment can go lower than expected without triggering higher prices.
The existing strategy statement treats super-low unemployment as a risk to inflation that the central bank needs to ""mitigate"" rather than as a bonus for workers as long as prices are tame.
Tolerance for faster price increases, implicit in an average inflation goal, ought to allow for lower unemployment since the Fed would leave financial conditions looser even as prices picked up - not nip employment growth in the bud as critics say it has been too prone to do. 
That is a mouthful for Powell to explain, perhaps more so with about 28 million Americans collecting unemployment benefits. While wider inflation is modest, the fastest price increases of late have been for essentials like food and appliances.
""What if we are unlucky and we get high unemployment and inflation over 2%?"" , said Ed Al-Hussainy, a senior analyst with Columbia Threadneedle. Those were the very conditions that led the Fed in the 1970s to wage a two-decade battle to set its credibility as an inflation fighter.

""Messaging the algebra to Congress and the public is a complete nightmare,"" Al-Hussainy said.

Investing.com -- Hurricane Laura bears down on Texas and Louisiana, but oil prices come off their highs. Germany extends its job support scheme for another year. Stocks are set to open mixed ahead of durable goods data at 8:30 AM ET and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has a blowout quarter thanks to the Great Acceleration. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, August 26th.
1. As big as Katrina
The National Hurricane Center said the storm front Laura is set to make landfall as a Category 4 hurricane and warned of life-threatening storm surges, extreme winds and flash flooding over eastern Texas and Louisiana. 
The NHC’s categorization ranks Laura equal in force with Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005.
""On the forecast track, Laura should approach the Upper Texas and southwest Louisiana coasts on this evening and move inland near those areas tonight or (Thursday) morning,"" it said.
2. Oil prices edge off highs as Gulf refineries shut down
Oil prices came off five-month highs ahead of the storm, while gasoline futures also edged lower to $1.3863 by 6:30 AM ET (1030).
According to Petroleum Argus, some 2.6 million barrels a day of U.S. refining capacity has been temporarily shut in, with Chevron’s 100,000 b/d Pasadena refinery joining a lengthening list of installations to close on Wednesday. That’s more than 13% of total U.S. refining capacity that won’t be buying any crude for at least a couple of days.
The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement estimated on Tuesday that around 84% of crude production in the Gulf of Mexico – equivalent to 1.6 million barrels a day - has been shut in.
The hurricane is overshadowing what appears to have been another bigger-than-expected draw on U.S. oil stocks last week. The American Petroleum Institute estimated it at 4.5 million barrels on Tuesday. The Energy Information Administration’s data are due at 10:30 AM ET (1430 GMT)
3. Stocks set to open mixed after Tuesday records
U.S. stocks are set to open mixed after posting yet more all-time highs Tuesday as the implications of collapsing consumer confidence sink in.  
The Conference Board’s sentiment index slumped to a six-year low in August as the enhanced unemployment benefits approved in the CARES Act expired without being fully replaced. 
By 6:30 AM ET, the Dow futures contract was down 52 points, or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was effectively unchanged. Nasdaq 100 futures were, however, up another 0.3%.
Today's light calendar for data is headed by the release of durable goods orders for July at 8:30 AM ET.
4. Germany extends wage subsidies for another year
Germany’s government agreed in principle to extend the country’s subsidy scheme for workers on shortened hours by another 12 months through the end of next year.
While that reinforces the commitment of Europe’s largest economy to sustaining demand, it also reflects expectations that the effects of the pandemic will be felt on the labor market long after one or more of the vaccines currently in development become widely available. The move contrasts with the U.K., which has said it intends to end its wage support scheme in October.
The benchmark DAX index rose 0.6% by lunchtime in Frankfurt, while the EUR/USD was down 0.2% at $1.1812.
Elsewhere, the French government edged closer to announcing what is expected to be a 100 billion-euro stimulus package next week.
5. Salesforce crushes it
Anyone wondering why Salesforce should replace  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average had their doubts answered after the software firm with a huge beat in its quarterly earnings and a big upgrade to its earnings guidance.
The company’s results were typical of the “great acceleration” theme embraced by investors who have bet on the pandemic speeding up the process of business migrating to the Internet, and to Cloud-based technologies in particular.
For the full 2021 fiscal year Salesforce now sees $3.72 to $3.74 in adjusted earnings per share, some 25% above the consensus estimate before the earnings were released.   
 Intuit  (NASDAQ:INTU) and Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) also beat expectations with earnings released after the close on Tuesday, but department store Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN)  (NYSE:JWN) disappointed."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Energy on Wednesday said it will provide $625 million over the next five years for five newly formed quantum information research hubs as it tries to keep ahead of competing nations like China on the emerging technology.
The funding is part of $1.2 billion earmarked in the National Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Initiative Act in 2018.
Researchers believe quantum computers could operate millions of times faster than today’s advanced supercomputers, making possible potential tasks ranging from mapping complex molecular structures and chemical reactions to boosting the power of artificial intelligence.
“It’s absolutely imperative the United States continues to lead the world in AI and quantum. We know our adversaries around the world are pursuing their own advances,” U.S. Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios said during a White House press briefing announcing the quantum information research funding and another $100 million plus investment into the National Science Foundation’s AI Research Institutes.
The five research hubs are each led by the Energy Department’s Argonne, Brookhaven, Fermi, Lawrence Berkeley and Oak Ridge national laboratories. The hubs are comprised of top research universities, other national labs and big tech companies in the quantum computing space such as International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM),  Intel Corp  (O:INTC),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), and quantum computer startups Rigetti & Co and ColdQuanta Inc. An Italian research lab and a Canadian university are also taking part.
Missing from the list are Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), considered one of the top firms in quantum computing, and Honeywell International Inc (N:HON), which unveiled its quantum computing business in the past year. The Energy Department spokesperson declined to comment on whether they had been part of a proposal that didn’t receive funding.

Paul Dabbar, under secretary for science at the Energy Department, said the private sector contributed another $340 million worth of labor, equipment, lab space and other assets to the project.

At a meeting in Berlin that ended late Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition agreed to provide job-preserving subsidies until the end of 2021. The subsidies, known in German as “Kurzarbeit” and originally intended for 12 months, pay the bulk of paychecks and allow companies to hold on to workers during an economic shock.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said the money for the extension will come out of next year’s federal budget, adding to the 1.2 trillion euros Germany has made available to prop up the economy during the pandemic.
“Right now it’s about stabilizing the economy,” Scholz said Wednesday in an interview with ZDF television. “Because we acted swiftly and comprehensively, it has helped Germany come through the crisis much better than many other countries.”
Germany has used the compensation program to prevent mass layoffs before, helping the country weather the financial crisis just over a decade ago when Scholz was Labor Minister. There were about 5.6 million people receiving the benefits in July, compared with 7 million people in May, according to the Munich-based Ifo Institute for Economic Research.
‘Far From Normal’
The expanded benefits were part of a huge spending package aimed at helping the country emerge from the worst crisis in the postwar era, and the extension indicates that a rebound may take longer than initially anticipated.
Still, there was good news earlier on Tuesday with a report showing German companies have turned slightly more optimistic that the economy’s road to recovery will continue. Ifo’s business confidence gauge rose more than expected in August, while expectations also improved.
“We are seeing some fairly positive data on the current state of the economy,” Scholz told ZDF. “Things are going better than was feared a few weeks ago.”
Ifo President Clemens Fuest warned that while the recovery is on track, things are “far from normal,” and companies are likely to continue to cut jobs.
Germany’s wage-support program initially covers as much as 67% of net wages for households with children and increases over time. The European Commission is using the German program as a model for a regional effort to ensure that workers are furloughed and not sacked.
“It’s right that the most important instrument we have to fight the coronavirus crisis and secure jobs is continued in a practical and responsible way,” Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the head of Merkel’s Christian Democratic party, said Wednesday in an interview with ZDF.
“The most expensive thing for the state would be mass unemployment and a mass extinction of companies and that’s exactly what intelligent use of Kurzarbeit cash can prevent,” she added. “That’s what we saw during the crisis in 2008 to 2009.”
Election Reform
Aside from the wage benefits, the coalition agreed on a contentious election reform. The changes will be implemented in two steps, starting in next year’s national vote and continued in 2025. The goal is to reduce the size of the lower house of parliament, which currently has a record 709 seats.
The number could have grown to more than 800 seats after the next election because of a system that grants additional representation depending on the results.
The coalition also agreed to use some of the cash from the European Union’s recovery fund to equip teachers with laptop computers at a cost of 500 million euros.

926,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 05:27AM ET</span>",Fed Seen Holding Rates at Zero for Five-Years Plus in New Policy,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve looks likely to keep short-term interest rates near zero for five years or possibly more after it adopts a new strategy for carrying out monetary policy.
The new approach, which could be unveiled as soon as next month, is likely to result in policy makers taking a more relaxed view toward inflation, even to the point of welcoming a modest, temporary rise above their 2% target to make up for past shortfalls.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to provide an update on the Fed’s 1-1/2-year-old framework review of its policies and practices when he speaks on Thursday to the central bank’s Jackson Hole conference, being held virtually this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if interest rates are still zero five years from now,” said Jason Furman, a former chief White House economist and now Harvard University professor.
That would be good news for some investors. Thanks in no small part to the Fed’s ultra-accommodative monetary policy, the S&P 500 stock-market index is trading at a record high even though the U.S. economy has yet to recover much of the ground it lost in the deepest downturn since the Great Depression as the pandemic took hold.
FOMC Forecasts
At their June meeting, all 17 Fed policy makers projected that the federal funds rate they target would remain near zero this year and next. And all but two saw rates staying at that level in 2022. Officials will provide updated quarterly forecasts at their meeting next month, including for the first time projections for 2023.
“We’re not even thinking about thinking about raising rates,” Powell told reporters following the June meeting, in a memorable maxim that he’s repeated since.
Eurodollar futures aren’t currently pricing any premium for Fed rate hikes until early 2023, with a full quarter-point increase priced in toward the end of 2023. Some traders, though, have viewed this as slightly too dovish, with demand emerging for hedges against a steeper path than is currently priced in for 2023 and 2024. Some see ultra-easy monetary policy eventually spurring inflation.
Lower for Longer
The Fed held rates near zero for seven years during and after the financial crisis before raising them in December 2015. Former Fed Vice Chairman Alan Blinder doubts it will be that long this time, though he adds that he would have said the same thing when the Fed first cut rates effectively to zero in December 2008.
“It’s perfectly conceivable it could take seven years” before rates are increased, given how difficult it’s been for the Fed to generate faster inflation, said former U.S. central bank official Roberto Perli, who is now a partner at Cornerstone Macro LLC.
In the last decade, it took more than three years for inflation-adjusted gross domestic product to rise back to the level that prevailed before the 2007-09 financial crisis. The recovery is expected to be faster this time:  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) global head of economic research Peter Hooper sees GDP attaining its first-quarter level in the first half of 2022, though much will depend on the development and dissemination of a vaccine.
Framework Review
But staying the Fed’s hand will be a change in how it reacts to developments in the economy as a result of the framework review.
When it raised interest rates in December 2015, core inflation was clocked at 1.5% -- it’s since been revised lower -- while unemployment stood at 5%.
Economists said it’s hard to see the Fed increasing rates under similar conditions now.
The Fed first pronounced a 2% target for inflation in 2012, and officials took that to mean they would always shoot for 2%, no matter how much or for how long they missed. Bygones, they said, would be bygones. The trouble was that inflation has consistently run below their objective since then.
Under the new regime, the Fed is expected to seek an inflation rate that roughly averages 2% over time. So a modest rise in inflation above target would be welcomed, not feared, after an extended period where it undershot.
The Fed is also expected to codify a change in its approach toward achieving full employment. In the past, officials shied away from pushing joblessness below what was considered its long-run natural rate out of concern that would lead to too rapid inflation.
Labor Market
Now, the emphasis is on the benefits of a strong labor market for the economy and society. “They’re not going to act to cool off the labor market unless it’s generating unwanted inflation,” said Nomura Chief U.S. Economist Lewis Alexander. “That’s essentially walking away from the concept that there is a natural rate that it is irresponsible to push beyond.”
Powell has said he’d like to see the jobs market return to its pre-Covid-19 state, when unemployment stood at a half-century low of 3.5%. It’s now 10.2%
Blinder said it will take years to do that. “I hope it won’t be decades,” the Princeton University professor added.
The bottom line for policy: a prolonged period of rock-bottom interest rates.
“I’d be very surprised if it’s less than three years,” said David Wilcox, a former Fed official now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “I could see it being as much as six or seven years if the damage from the crisis proves to be much more long lasting.”

Castex told France Inter radio that the package would include 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) to support the arts and culture.
The government said on Saturday it would present details of its 100 billion euro ($118 billion) plan in the first week of September, instead of on Aug. 25, as it focuses on preparing the new school term.
Castex also said the authorities would do all they could to avoid a new lockdown to limit the spread of the epidemic.
He noted that the virus has not gone down in terms of its virulence, however.

Professor Jean-Francois Delfraissy, who heads the scientific council that advises the government on COVID-19, said that a second wave of the epidemic could hit the country in November.

The German economy contracted at its steepest rate on record in the second quarter and the government is desperate to mitigate the effects of the pandemic as much as possible, especially in the run-up to elections in the autumn of 2021.
""Corona remains a reality and a challenge,"" said Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, leader of the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) after around seven hours of talks with their centre-left Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners.
""Today we have agreed that we will extend important and effective measures to how we deal with the coronavirus,"" she added.
Among the main decisions were an extension of short-time work subsidies, which had been due to expire in March 2021, until the end of next year and prolonging bridging aid for small and mid-sized companies until the end of this year.
Short-time work saves jobs by allowing employers to reduce the employees' hours but keeps them in work.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, told public broadcaster ZDF the measures could cost up to 10 billion euros next year.
""The goal now is to stabilise the economy,"" said Scholz. ""The fact that we acted fast and big has resulted in Germany weathering the crisis much better than other (countries).""
The parties also agreed to prolong measures aimed at staving off bankruptcies by allowing firms in financial trouble due to the pandemic to delay filing for insolvency until the end of the year. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also brought in a massive stimulus package, worth more than 130 billion euros, that it hopes will help the economy return to growth.

The government has said it would set up special transfer payments of 2 trillion yuan ($289.72 billion) from special treasury bonds and an increased budget deficit to local governments. 
""The implementation of specific policies and measures will have a positive impact on investment, consumption as well as imports and exports,"" Xu told a briefing.
Of the 2 trillion yuan, 1.7 trillion yuan will be allocated to local governments after deducting 300 billion yuan for supporting tax and fee cuts this year, Xu said.
Local governments have spent 509.7 billion yuan, accounting for 30.5% of 1.674 trillion yuan in funds that have been actually allocated from the central government, he said.
Xu said he expected cities and counties that have already received the funds will speed up spending.
The authorities will punish officials who intercept and misappropriate the funds, or those who make false claims, Li Jinghui, a finance ministry official, told the same briefing.
China has set a 2020 budget deficit of at least 3.6% of GDP, up from last year's 2.8%. The government has finished issuing 1 trillion yuan in special treasury bonds.

933,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 02:15AM ET</span>","Column: Public confidence, often inscrutable, pivotal for recovery - Mike Dolan","By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - Public confidence in virus control, rather than the length and stringency of government lockdowns, may be the best way to gauge how economies emerge from this year's pandemic - though tracking that confidence can be a bewildering business.
Apparent gaps between what people are saying and doing complicate the task facing economists in assessing confidence, and how economies are expected to heal - at least before the arrival of a game-changing vaccine that's still likely to be at least six months away.
Britain provided an example of this confusion last week, with retail sales volumes returning to pre-pandemic levels in July despite consumer confidence polls remaining mired in gloom close to 10-year lows for the past two months.
There's a similar picture in the United States, where consumer confidence readings are also stuck near six-year lows even as retail sales return to their highest on record in July.
Pent-up savings, government support and a surge in online purchases - reflected in investors' obsession with technology stocks since March - partly explain the seeming contradictions in data. But only partly, not least with renewal of many of those policy supports in question over the month ahead.
Analysis by management consultancy McKinsey this month said public confidence in overall safety rather than the mechanical ebb and flow of government lockdowns was now crucial to return gross domestic product quickly to pre-COVID-19 levels.
The firm's economists reckoned the actual or expected drop in GDP across developed economies through June of this year was not as tightly correlated with the stringency of societal lockdowns, or their length, as many investors had assumed.
It said high-frequency data found no significant difference in employment or consumer spending between U.S. states that maintained longer lockdowns versus those that relaxed them early.
And it cited a study by University of Chicago economists Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson of footfall at 2.25 million U.S. companies and found differences in local restrictions accounted for only 7 percentage points of an average 60% drop in local consumer traffic - indicating people stayed home of their own accord and avoided larger, high-traffic businesses if they did venture out.
""The recovery is limited not so much by policy as the reluctance of individuals to engage in social economic activity,"" McKinsey said, adding its own consumer research found that more than 50% ""cautious"" or ""uncomfortable"" about re-engaging in daily routines and only 30% saying they'd feel safer when government restrictions are lifted.

https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvglbrlpq/retail.PNG
LIVES AND JOBS
So how does that confidence re-appear absent a vaccine?
The firm's polling found it was a whole of variety of issues rather, than any one measure, and also hinged on credible and consistent government communication.
About 75% of consumers would feel more comfortable if they saw people wearing masks, 65% if they saw data of declining infections in their locale and 56% if public health authorities said it was safe to re-engage.
""The evidence heavily suggests that a multifaceted public-health response that goes well beyond a simple transient lockdown is a necessary first step to restore confidence,"" it said, adding the GDP impact of getting that right was huge and every three-month delay in controlling the virus pushed back the return of GDP to pre-crisis levels by six months.
And yet the public response gets murkier when you see some other polls.
Asset manager Franklin Templeton last month sponsored the first in a series of surveys of 10,000 Americans by pollster Gallup and found stark misperceptions about the effect of COVID-19 that may speak to both economic behaviour, the efficacy of public information and where people get their news.
For example, the poll showed people on average thought about 50% of those killed by the disease were older than 55 - whereas official figures show 92% of fatalities in that group.
What's more, political affiliation also appears to play a big part. While 52% of U.S. adults as a whole say they are now still uncomfortable flying, the number was 42% for Republicans, 59% for Democrats and 54% of independents. Similar breakdowns appeared for questions on restaurant dining.
""The fact that a large share of the population overestimates the COVID-19 danger to the young will make a targeted public health response more difficult to agree on,"" said Sonal Desai, chief investment officer at Franklin Templeton Fixed Income.
""We think it is also likely to delay the recovery, causing a deeper and prolonged recession.""
Of course, for economists to extrapolate economic consequences, they must believe that the actions of people polled will be true to their words.
For retail at least, this might have been a bum steer through this summer and the true picture remains an enigma.

The lawsuit - which names President Donald Trump, the postal service and Postmaster General Louis DeJoy - asks the court to vacate recent changes made to the U.S. Postal Service and to stop it from implementing additional service reductions.
A planned overhaul of the post office, which is suffering deep financial shortfalls, has worried Democrats concerned that voters who want to avoid the new coronavirus will be prevented from casting ballots by mail because of potential delays in receiving voting materials or returning them.
U.S. Postmaster Louis DeJoy told lawmakers recently that he would resume some cost-cutting measures that have factored in widespread service delays after the Nov. 3 election.
""This USPS slowdown is nothing more than a voter suppression tactic,"" James said in a statement, noting that medicines and other critical mail were also being delayed. ""These authoritarian actions are not only jeopardizing our democracy and fundamental right to vote, but the immediate health and financial well-being of Americans across the nation.""
The lawsuit was filed by New York, New Jersey, Hawaii, New York City and San Francisco. Six states, led by Pennsylvania, sued the U.S. Postal Service and the new postmaster general on Aug. 21, saying service changes in recent weeks have harmed the ability of states to conduct free and fair elections.
The earlier lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Pennsylvania, was joined by California, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, North Carolina and the District of Columbia.

DeJoy, who has donated $2.7 million to President Donald Trump and other Republicans since 2016, has rejected charges that the changes stem from political interference. Trump has said repeatedly, without evidence, that absentee voting is unreliable, even though he has voted that way himself.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will slide into mild deflation for the next three years as the coronavirus crisis crushes demand and leads to more job losses, but the Bank of Japan is unlikely to ramp up stimulus to support prices, a former central bank policymaker said. 
Cutting interest rates further will hurt already weak regional lenders, which could face a build-up of bad loans as they boost lending to cash-strapped firms hit by COVID-19, Takahide Kiuchi said.
""Japan will likely see more small and midsized firms go under as the pandemic's pain deepens, which could boost credit costs for lenders through next year,"" said Kiuchi, currently executive economist at Nomura Research Institute.
""The pandemic has forced the BOJ to be more mindful of the risk of banking-sector problems, which means it can't cut interest rates easily,"" he told Reuters on Tuesday.
Under a policy dubbed yield curve control, the BOJ guides short-term rates at -0.1% and long-term yields around zero.
While BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has stressed his readiness to cut rates if needed, many analysts see that option as highly unlikely given the strain years of ultra-low rates has inflicted on commercial banks' profits.
Kiuchi said Japan will need about five years for gross domestic product (GDP) to return to pre-pandemic levels.
""Core consumer inflation will hover in slightly negative territory for about three years,"" he said. ""But the BOJ has already detached its policy from its 2% inflation target, which means it won't take action to prop up prices.""
During his five-year tenure at the BOJ until 2017, Kiuchi was a consistent dissenter to Kuroda's radical stimulus measures on the view that excessive money printing could do more harm than good.

Japan suffered its biggest economic slump on record in the second quarter as the pandemic hit consumption and exports. Core consumer prices stood flat in July from a year earlier.

937,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",Three-Decade Economic Boom Comes to a Sudden Halt in Vietnam,"(Bloomberg) -- For the past three decades, Vietnam has known only good -- or great -- economic news. The nation’s consistent growth as an exporter, propelled by Communist leaders who began embracing market-oriented policies in the late 1980s, pushed many into the middle class.
The coronavirus pandemic changed all that. With garment companies seeing orders slashed and other sectors hit with sudden export declines, Vietnam’s workers are enduring the downside of being tethered to the global economy. The economic slowdown in the U.S. and other markets Vietnam depends on for growth is being felt on the streets of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, as well as in villages and tourist centers.
Le Thi Hoa, who sells pineapple and mango slices outside Ho Chi Minh City’s Ben Thanh Market in the heart of the commercial hub, is among those wondering where the good times have gone.
“Now people don’t go out,” said Hoa, 55, wearing a face mask and sitting on a plastic chair next to fruit baskets in front of a closed seafood restaurant. “I can only sell about a third of what I did before the epidemic.”
Vietnam has been one of globalization’s stars, transforming itself from a largely agricultural economy to a manufacturing powerhouse within the span of a few decades. With exports equivalent to the size of its GDP, Vietnam has seen its economy grow as fast at 7.02% in 2019. Now it’s bracing for the slowest growth in two decades, of 2.4% this year. During the second quarter, it expanded by just 0.36% from a year earlier.
“Vietnam has experienced a tsunami of good news over the past 30 years,” said Ralf Matthaes, managing director of Infocus Mekong Research, who has lived in the country since 1994. “This is the first time since joining the global economic community two decades ago that Vietnam is experiencing a significant economic downturn.”
Vietnam’s abrupt slump highlights the sweep of the epidemic’s financial fallout and how even countries that have been relatively successful in containing the virus are unable to avoid its economic afflictions. Such economies won’t be able to return to business as usual until the rest of the world does.
“It’s likely to be quite bumpy,” said Sian Fenner, a Singapore-based economist at Oxford Economics, which forecasts an 8% contraction in global trade for 2020. “Countries that are export-oriented will remain vulnerable.”
In April, Vietnam’s exports plummeted 14% from a year earlier, followed by a drop of 12.4% in May as global commerce came to a standstill, according to the Department of Vietnam Customs. For the seven months through July, exports rose just 1.5% compared with 8% in the same period last year.
Trade Tethered
Vietnam’s leaders, though, show no signs of reversing economic course after signing more than a dozen trade agreements in recent years and making the nation a magnet for foreign investment.
The government, grappling with an outbreak in the coastal city of Danang that has spread to 14 provinces and cities, has garnered international respect for its virus containment. Until July 31, the country hadn’t reported a single infection death. It confirmed 1,029 virus cases and 27 deaths as of Aug. 25 as officials employ tough anti-virus measures, while allowing manufacturing businesses to stay open.
Though Vietnam is in better shape than other economies in Asia, where the virus has been far more deadly and disruptive, its reliance on foreign markets and a growing tourism industry have given its residents a lesson in global volatility.
In recent years, Vietnam has become a key cog in the global supply chain. It has opened factories for companies including  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)., Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co. and LG Electronics Inc., as well as solar panel makers and garment producers. Vietnam’s exports in 2019 reached $264.3 billion -- a fourfold jump since 2008. Average annual salaries rose from $1,154 to about $2,800 in that period, according to government data.
The pace of Vietnam’s shipments to the U.S., its largest market representing about 23% of exports in 2019, slowed in the first half of 2020 compared with the same period last year. The government reported a 14.6% increase in exports to the U.S., about half the rate of shipment growth in 2019.
Many of the sectors that have been hard hit, such as garments and textiles, employ millions of low-skilled workers. Samsung’s Vietnam unit, whose electronics products represented about 20% of the country’s total exports last year, revised its 2020 exports forecast to $45.5 billion, a $13.5 billion drop from 2019, according to the industry and trade ministry.
Tourism Woes
Meanwhile, the tourism industry, which represents about 9% of the economy, had a 55.4% revenue drop during the first seven months of the year. Given the pounding to the manufacturing and hospitality industries, almost a third of the population -- 31 million workers -- endured a financial fallout during the second quarter.
The global economic pain has been exacerbated by the virtual lockdown of the economy for much of April and restrictions amid the new outbreak.
With millions of assembly-line employees out of work, some local governments worry about the potential for social unrest, said Fred Burke, managing partner at the Baker McKenzie law firm in Ho Chi Minh City. He recalled that Minister of Planning and Investment Nguyen Chi Dung recently pleaded with Vietnam Business Forum members not to fire their workers but to hold on to them as long as they could.
Given the disruptions, consumer confidence is at its lowest point in 25 years, according to Infocus Mekong Research. Two-thirds of Vietnamese residents are deferring or deciding not to make big purchases. And 63% of Vietnamese are considering taking out loans as they seek financial lifeboats, the research firm said.
“Everyone is saving and we don’t go out so much,” said Bui Viet Nam, a 34-year-old executive with a Ho Chi Minh City garment manufacturer. “Incomes are going down and people are thinking about ways to earn more money through selling things online or getting a second part-time job. It’s a new world.”

938,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 05:18PM ET</span>",Thailand Turns to Faster Road and Rail Spending to Prop Up Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- Thailand’s Transport Ministry plans to accelerate spending on roads and rail projects in the fiscal year starting in October to aid an economy hammered by a slump in exports and tourism.
Key programs include expansion of Bangkok’s mass-transit network and expressways linking several nearby provinces and the nation’s eastern seaboard to Bangkok, as about half of Thailand’s gross domestic product comes from the capital city though it has less than a 10th of the nation’s population.
Also high on the government’s transport agenda is a highway network connecting neighboring countries and a high-speed rail that goes through neighboring countries to China.
“I’m trying to expedite budget disbursement because government spending can generate a chain reaction that increases economic activities,” Transport Minister Saksiam Chidchob said in an interview.
Funds will be a combination of the ministry’s annual budget allocation from the central government, revenue from state enterprises and income from various funds, Saksiam said. The transport budget in the new fiscal year will be 232 billion baht ($7.4 billion), up about 32% from the current period.
One key is to actually spend the money, Saksiam said. The disbursement rate for the investment portion of the government’s overall budget this fiscal year through mid-July was just 37%, according to the Finance Ministry. Specific figures for the Transport Ministry weren’t available.
Even before Covid-19, infrastructure spending was typically delayed by political wrangling and personnel changes. About 70% of the government’s investment budget was used in fiscal 2019, according to the Finance Ministry.
Fund Disbursement
“Disbursement has declined in recent years,” according to Tim Leelahaphan, an economist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Pcl in Bangkok. “And the government now appears focused on providing a short-term boost to the economy via private consumption rather than investment revival.”
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha reshuffled his Cabinet lineup this month. Though Saksiam kept his job at the Transport Ministry, Predee Daochai was appointed finance minister and Supattanapong Punmeechaow was named deputy premier in charge of the economy -- a role that oversees many large infrastructure projects.
Among the most ambitious efforts is the Eastern Economic Corridor, a favorite of former Deputy Premier Somkid Jatusripitak. The EEC is a highly industrialized area near Bangkok that has been promoted by the government as the key area for investment in industries such as automotive, robotics, logistics, health care and medical tourism.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic will test public confidence in the Bank of Canada's 2% inflation target, a senior official at the bank said on Tuesday.
Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri said Canadians' faith in the ability of the bank to keep inflation close to 2% had allowed it react effectively at the start of the crisis by cutting rates three times to record low levels.
""While we have benefited from having well-anchored inflation expectations in the past, this mooring will be tested by the very rough economic waters caused by the pandemic,"" Schembri told a business audience, without elaborating.
Schembri said people would shrug off temporary movements in inflation if they believe it was set to remain on track in the long run. Public confidence in the target, Schembri noted, meant the bank's decision to cut rates had had more of an impact.
""If inflation expectations had not been well anchored, the reduction in our policy interest rate would have had less impact. Consequently, more monetary stimulus would have been necessary,"" he said, without giving details.
But the average consumer thinks they are facing higher inflation than what has been announced, a gap that has become more pronounced during the pandemic and should be acknowledged by policy makers, Schembri noted.
The 2% inflation rate target is jointly reviewed by the central bank and the government of Canada every five years. The current target is set to expire in December 2021.

On Monday, the bank announced it had launched an online survey asking Canadians to provide feedback on its inflation targeting framework. The online survey marks the first time the bank has sought public input about the target.

Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan suffered from a major plunge in the GDP growth last quarter. We all know that the slump in the economy came thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the more surprising part was the extent of this decline for some countries. Singapore’s GDP plunged by a massive 13.2% YoY in the second quarter ending June 2020. The lockdown inflicted damage on the tourism and retail sectors of Singapore while weak global demand impacted the exports.
Talking of exports, South Korea is another economy that is dependent a lot on exports for its economic growth. Although its GDP declined by a nominal 2.9% in the June quarter compared to the last year, it was still the biggest fall in the last 22 years. Exports for South Korea plunged by 16.6%.
Hong Kong, which is already struggling from the double whammy of coronavirus and China imposing national security law on it, suffered from a 9% contraction in its GDP in the last quarter. Hong Kong’s GDP has now declined for the fourth straight quarter, which has already been hit by the anti-government protests last year.
Out of all the Asian Tigers economies, Taiwan’s economy was the least impacted as its GDP declined by a mere 0.73% year-on-year. Taiwan was able to control the spread of the coronavirus, and the decline mainly came from the reduction of travelers thereby impacting the airlines and the hotel industry.
The damage to the economy was even higher to developed economies like the U.S. and the UK. US GDP contracted by 34% but the fiscal and monetary support from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the US government supported the stock markets. Similarly, the UK’s GDP declined by 20% in the last quarter."

LONDON (Reuters) - The option of a one-time payment holiday during times of intense crisis might enable countries to pandemic-proof their bonds, a prominent debt fund believes.
Economic fallout from COVID-19 has triggered a record number of sovereign defaults in 2020, and managers at Boston-based GMO, heavily involved in sovereign restructurings in recent years, have proposed redesigning bonds so that countries can suspend or even wipe off debt payments for up to a year. 
Credit rating agency S&P has downgraded 51 countries this year, and four - Lebanon, Ecuador, Argentina and Belize - have already defaulted, beating a record set in 2017.
""In the case of Ecuador, it might have provided enough liquidity relief to prevent a default,"" said GMO's Carl Ross, one of the payment holiday plan's two architects and a negotiator in Ecuador's and Argentina's restructurings.
He favours that idea over current approaches such the linking of debt payments to economic fortunes chosen in 2012 by Greece, and the ""hurricane clause"" - offering debt relief if a second catastrophic storm hits - used in Grenada's 2015 restructuring.
""Our proposal is to revert to something much simpler,"" Ross said. ""The whole idea is to prevent countries getting into distress in the first place"".
Sui-Jim Ho, a partner at Cleary Gottlieb - the law firm that helped draft Granada's hurricane clause - said discussion around temporary debt suspensions was gaining traction.
However, he questioned how simple implementing them would be.
""We still need to figure out how the pandemic trigger event should be drafted,"" he said ""...Defined too loosely and it could be triggered too easily. Defined too restrictively and you could end up with too little too late.""
Graphic: Bond prices plunge ahead of defaults https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvllxenvb/Pasted%20image%201598352935580.png
GAME THEORY
Ross said the potential criticism that GMO's proposal could be abused by politicians looking for creative funding options was a low risk.
Bond markets would soon work out governments that tried to play the system, and as the deferral option would only be available once - or perhaps once a decade for long-term bonds - it was also likely to be used sparingly.
""Interactions between bond markets and governments are a 'repeated game' ... We believe this dynamic would be a very effective self-policing mechanism,"" he said.
His idea would need International Monetary Fund or U.S. Treasury support to take off, and a country would also have prove it was workable.
Ross said he suggested it to Ecuador but the process was moving too fast by then, and it wouldn't have prevented Argentina or Lebanon defaulting as their debts had already spiralled out of control. 
Countries hit by multiple crises wouldn't be saved either as having more than one deferral or debt forgiveness option would ramp up their borrowing costs.
Ross and the proposal's co-author, Mustafa Ulukan, estimate that a single one-year deferral option might only add 0.6% to the 8% a country with a low B-grade rating might pay to borrow for 10 years.
The approach could also address 'freeriding' criticism private sector bondholders are now facing for not following G20 governments and allowing the world's poorest countries to suspend debt payments during COVID-19.
Pressure for that to happen is growing but creditors warn the rating agencies would class it as a default, opening up a host of problems. That is something GMO thinks its plan would avoid.
""This (deferral) option, if broadly used, would be extraordinarily valuable in the current global environment,"" Ross said. ""This year and 2021, we have a lot of countries that are going to default.""

943,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 09:18AM ET</span>",Trump’s New Jobless Benefit Trickles Out With Two States Paying,"(Bloomberg) -- The emergency benefit payments ordered two weeks ago by President Donald Trump are just starting to trickle into jobless Americans’ wallets.
Participation is up to individual states, and as of Monday just two -- Arizona and Texas -- had begun paying out the supplemental $300 a week in benefits. Of the other states that have received funding for the program, Missouri hopes to start paying by this weekend; Utah and New Mexico anticipate it will be a few weeks before payments reach residents; Colorado is targeting mid-September; Iowa didn’t provide a timeline; and Louisiana didn’t respond to requests for comment, though it said on Aug. 19 it expected to distribute benefits “within the next week.”
As of Monday, 30 states had been approved for the program, with updates occurring daily. South Dakota publicly said it won’t participate.
The partial, gradual rollout limits the immediate impact of Trump’s stopgap action to provide $300 a week in additional federal aid for most jobless claimants, leaving families in a lurch as they wait for the supplemental income and holding back the economy more broadly. Lawmakers have failed to reach agreement on extending $600-a-week supplemental benefits, which expired in July and helped bring some semblance of regional equity to America’s patchwork social safety net.
Part of the reason for the slow start is that implementing the new program, known as Lost Wages Assistance, falls on overwhelmed state unemployment offices that have already struggled to process applications and deliver benefits during the pandemic. Another complication is that the program’s funding is coming from disaster money at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, an agency state officials are not accustomed to working with for unemployment-insurance matters.
The program requires working with a new agency and creating a new system with new rules and new reporting requirements, said Bill McCamley, head of the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions.
“If we don’t follow the rules correctly, we could be penalized in the future,” he said.
Tax Confusion
That’s what happened to some extent earlier this year when states tried to quickly implement a new federal program -- Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, or the federal program that extends jobless benefits to those not traditionally eligible like gig workers and the self-employed.
In New Mexico, the state launched the PUA program allowing applicants to use their 2018 tax information, but learned a week later that applicants had to use 2019 information instead. In other cases, confusion over how PUA recipients needed to certify or who qualified for the new aid led to other problems for states.
If, for example, a state paid out PUA benefits for a week the unemployed recipient shouldn’t have received payment for, the benefits have to be recouped, said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project. That means reclaiming money from people who have often already spent it.
“If I were a state agency director, I would definitely -- before I start handing out money that I might have to pay back at a time when there’s no way I can pay it back -- I’d be pretty clear on what every single detail is,” Evermore said.
Even in a best-case scenario, the program’s benefits would be limited. FEMA has been authorized to provide up to $44 billion in support, which economists estimate would last just one to two months if paid as intended to millions receiving jobless benefits.
Income Support
Such stimulus has proved essential to consumer spending: Unemployment benefits made up about 7% of Americans’ incomes in June, the biggest share on record. Without any supplemental unemployment payments, one paper estimates local spending would fall 44%.
The technicalities of Trump’s order -- and the interpretation of them -- create a host of challenges. The U.S. Department of Labor released a fact sheet on the program early last week with 29 questions and answers.
One key hitch: States are required to share the costs to some extent, but states can count the money they’re already paying toward unemployment benefits in this calculation. There are also administrative hurdles in determining precisely who’s eligible.
“Any more uncertainty on any level is just the bane of these state agencies’ existence,” Evermore said.

(Reuters) - Billionaire Bill Gates is leading satellite antenna firm Kymeta’s latest funding round with a $78 million investment, the company’s president told Reuters.
Redmond, Washington-based Kymeta, which sells pizza box-sized antennas for installation on cars, trains and boats, secured $85.2 million in capital. It plans to launch a monthly subscription service for satellite-based internet to government customers later this year, Kymeta President and COO Walter Berger said in an interview.
“The thesis here is to advance connectivity on a global basis. Cellular doesn’t do that,” he said.
Gates's firm, which has invested in at least one other funding round, did not immediately return a request for comment.
Kymeta antennas mainly link with satellites in high orbital altitudes and can link to remote places as well moving planes and vehicles.
A range of companies, like Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), are building networks of satellites in low-Earth orbit, an expensive and high-risk endeavor that has sent satellite operator OneWeb into bankruptcy.
Kymeta’s funding round comes on the heels of acquiring satellite service provider Lepton Global Solutions LLC, cementing a key government customer base and gaining access to 17 communications satellites in orbit.
The company plans to launch a satellite antenna bundle by the end of 2020 for $1,000 a month, Berger said.

Kymeta has been in discussions with various companies building low-Earth orbit satellite constellations, Berger said.

Law, a former legislator, left Hong Kong last month after China imposed a new national security law on the territory that has been heavily criticised by the West.
Law spoke to reporters in Rome shortly before Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio was due to meet Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi, with the pair expected to discuss the roll out of new generation 5G technology in Italy.
Italy has not joined the United States in imposing restrictions on Huawei but the company was excluded from a recent  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) tender to supply technology for a 5G network in Italy and Brazil.
Law urged Western governments to be highly cautious in their dealings with Beijing.
""The most powerful authoritarian regime in the world is posing a threat to democracies, including using measures of infiltration, including using the influence of their state enterprises like Huawei,"" he said.
""If infrastructure like telecommunications, harbours or even the nuclear industry are controlled or are owned by Chinese companies then it will impose serious danger to the country.""
Huawei has denied allegations by the United States that it is a Trojan Horse for Chinese cyberspies and Beijing has criticised countries such as Britain and Australia, which have said they will shun the Chinese technology giant.
Di Maio and Wang were due to give a news conference at the end of their talks. Law called on Italy not to ignore what had happened in Hong Kong.

""My arrival and the message I'm bringing here is very clear: We need to address the human rights violations to China even if we're engaged with them and we have to be very aware of the infiltration and their authoritarian expansionist nature.""

946,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 08:30AM ET</span>","Indian government consumption key to growth in economy amid pandemic, central bank says","By Swati Bhat
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian government spending will support the economy during the pandemic, but private consumption will be needed to drive any economic recovery once the coronavirus threat eases, the central bank said on Tuesday.
""An assessment of aggregate demand during the year so far suggests that the shock to consumption is severe, and it will take quite some time to mend and regain the pre-COVID-19 momentum,"" the Reserve Bank of India said in its annual report.
April-June quarter GDP data, set to be released on Aug. 31, is expected to show a contraction of 20%, according to a Reuters poll.
Private consumption will come back gradually with non-discretionary spending leading the way, until a durable increase in disposable incomes enables discretionary spending to catch up, the bank added.
""Upticks that became visible in May and June after the lockdown was eased ... appear to have lost strength,"" the bank said.
This weakening was mainly due to reimposition or tougher imposition of lockdowns, suggesting the contraction in economic activity was likely to prolong into the second fiscal quarter, it added.
Key downside risks to growth are wider pandemic spread, a deviation of seasonal monsoon rains from the predicted normal volume and global financial market volatility, the bank said.
The RBI advised that fiscal incentives for industry ought to be re-aligned in favour of productive labour-intensive companies so as to generate employment. 
It also highlighted the need for specialised infrastructure-focused lending companies to help drive funding of major infrastructure projects. It also called for the diversification of financing options for companies, saying capital markets and foreign direct investment offer opportunities to bring in investors with a longer-term view, as also more durable capital.
The RBI said the banking sector needs to be freed of risk aversion, which is impeding the flow of credit to productive sectors and undermining the role of banks in the economy.
Despite a reduction in banks' bad loans as of March 2020, the system's resilience will be tested by the economic fallout of the pandemic, since measures to alleviate it masked the consequent build-up of stress in the system, the RBI said.
""Against this backdrop, a recapitalisation plan for public and private sector banks assumes critical importance,"" it added.
In a separate report, the RBI had warned that banks' bad loans could nearly double by the end of this fiscal year, while the capital adequacy ratio could fall to 11.8% in a severely stressed situation.
Data in the annual report showed frauds of 100,000 rupees and above at banks increased by 159% in terms of value in 2019/20, but the RBI said the date of occurrence of these was spread out over several previous years.
Total frauds stood at 1.86 trillion rupees in FY20 versus 715.43 billion rupees in FY19, data showed.
In the April-June quarter of 2020, however, frauds came down to 288.43 billion rupees in value versus 422.28 billion in the corresponding quarter in 2019.
The RBI's own balance sheet increased 30.02% by June 30, it added. 

The increase on the asset side was due to a rise in domestic and foreign investments, loans and gold while on the liability side it was due to the increase in notes issued, deposits and other liabilities, RBI said.

947,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>","As uncertainty threatens U.S. growth, Fed seeks more firepower","By Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - A year ago, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned fellow central bankers of the significant risks posed by trade policy uncertainty, and the lack of precedents for monetary policy in the face of those unknowns.
As Powell this week prepares to address the Fed's annual central bankers' conference - usually held in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, but being conducted virtually this year because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic - uncertainty and the threat it poses to economic growth looms larger than ever. 
Everything is up in the air now, including how fast the coronavirus will spread, how many more people will die from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, and whether U.S. lawmakers will deliver a new economic rescue package, and how big it will be if they do.
Added to that are political storm clouds gathering ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election, with President Donald Trump already stoking doubts over the fairness of the process and its outcome.
Against that background, Powell is expected to open the Kansas City Fed's annual economic policy conference on Thursday with an update on the U.S. central bank's plans to refit its monetary policy approach to a world where persistently low inflation and low interest rates numb the effects of the Fed's recession-fighting stimulus measures. 
Rising uncertainty about the economic outlook, which economists say stunts household spending, business investment and factory output, may add to pressure on the Fed to bolster its policy arsenal. 
""When you have high degrees of uncertainty, it tends to mean policy is less effective,"" says Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University. ""For a given bang you need many more bucks."" 
A gauge of economic uncertainty that Bloom developed with colleagues has skyrocketed this year.
And new research published last week by the Fed suggests that ""uncertainty shocks"" compound over time, so that several in a row deliver a much bigger blow to the economic outlook than each one might have in isolation. 
As much as economists recognize that uncertainty threatens growth, in other words, ""the existing paradigm is understating the true effects of uncertainty,"" the researchers wrote. 
Graphic: Uncertainty spike https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/JACKSONHOLE/yzdvxxrxdvx/index.html 
MORE CLARITY?
After a record-setting contraction last quarter, the U.S. economy has shown some signs of returning to growth, with existing home sales surging in July, and a widely followed survey showing business activity snapping back.
High-frequency data on retail store visits and employment across industries moved higher in recent weeks after plateauing amid a spike in COVID-19 cases earlier in the summer. 
Credit card spending also rose, data from JP Morgan shows, although that may not capture the activity of the roughly 28 million Americans who are collecting jobless benefits, which shrank this month as extra federal payments lapsed. 
Still, the recent upturn in economic data, along with a slowdown in new infections since mid-July, has some economists wondering whether the recovery will be more rapid than many think.
""We focus a lot on the downside risks; don’t forget about the other side of the distribution,"" Tim Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon, wrote in his blog on Monday. 
Still, Fed policymakers are concerned the plethora of unknowns is exacerbating downward pressure on growth. 
""Uncertainty is quite high, and I think uncertainty matters a lot for players in the economy, and consequently for the economy itself,"" Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said earlier this month. ""Many seem frozen in place by today's uncertainty."" 
In remarks that echoed the minutes from the Fed's most recent policy-setting meeting, Barkin said the biggest drivers of uncertainty are the course of the virus and whether the U.S. government will deliver a new rescue package to cushion the pandemic's economic fallout. Lawmakers have deadlocked in their talks over another stimulus package. 
Powell could use his speech this week to lay out a clearer path for what he and his colleagues do control: monetary policy. 
With low inflation and interest rates making the Fed's conventional tools less powerful than before, policymakers have been weighing whether to try to offset long periods of weak inflation with periods of higher inflation, an approach known as average inflation targeting. 
They have also discussed beefing up their promise to keep interest rates low for some time to come, perhaps by ruling out any future rate hikes until unemployment, which was 10.2% in July, falls to some specified level.

Both changes would mean easier monetary policy, which, all things being equal, should bolster economic growth.

Investing.com -- The U.S. and China held trade talks by phone and were unusually polite about it afterwards.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) got ejected from the Dow Jones Industrial Average along with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) as the index publisher adjusted to give tech a higher weighting. Stocks are set to open higher ahead of house price and consumer confidence data. Germany's economic recovery continues, and the Gulf of Mexico braces for Hurricane Laura. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, August 25th.
1. End of an era as DJIA rebalances
Exxon Mobil was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in a landmark rebalancing of the world’s most famous stock index.
The company, a descendant of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, has been the embodiment of the private oil and gas industry and its importance to an industrialized economy since its foundation, and its omission is a powerful statement about the long-term decline in influence and value of natural resource extraction.
Other companies losing their place in the DJIA were defense group Raytheon and pharma giant Pfizer. They’ll be replaced by software group Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), biotech group Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) (which, oddly, is smaller than Pfizer) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON). The changes are aimed at restoring the weight of technology in the price-weighted index, which was set to drop as a result of Apple’s looming stock split.
2. U.S.-China polite after rescheduled trade talks
The U.S. and China got around to holding trade talks by telephone, less than two weeks after President Donald Trump cancelled a scheduled review of their January deal.
“Both sides see progress” was the official line that followed the call between USTR Robert Lighthizer and Chinese trade representative Liu He. That glossed over the reality that China has bought less than half of what it promised to buy from the U.S. in January, partly as a result of the pandemic that crushed demand for oil and gas imports in the first half of the year.
According to various reports, China has booked ships to import record amounts of U.S. oil next month. The bookings are, however, subject to change.
3. Stocks set to open higher; Software, retail earnings eyed
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher on Wednesday, still supported by signs that the coronavirus pandemic is receding across the U.S., and also supported by the temporary easing of antagonism between the U.S. and China.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones Futures contract was up 176 points, or 0.6%, while futures on the S&P 500 index, which closed above 3,400 for the first time on Monday, were up 0.4%. The NASDAQ Futures contract was up 0.2%.
Salesforce gets a chance to show off its DJIA props later with its quarterly report after the closing bell. It will be joined by Intuit, and by struggling retailers Nordstrom and Urban Outfitters.  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT), Best Buy and Hormel Foods all report before the start of trade.
4. German recovery gains strength
The data calendar is a little heavier today, with house price data due at 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), and new home sales and the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index due at 8 AM. Redbook’s latest research update is also out at 6:55 AM.
Overseas, Germany’s second-quarter gross domestic product figures were revised up to show a decline of ‘only’ 9.7% instead of the 10.1% initially estimated. Private consumption and net exports were responsible for most of the decline.
The recovery of Europe’s largest economy continues, however, albeit with signs of it flattening out. The closely-watched Ifo business confidence index rose by slightly more than expected to 92.6, with the surprise coming from a more positive estimate of current conditions. Expectations dimmed slightly.
5. Tell Laura I fear her
Crude oil prices remained well supported both by the trade talks and the German data, but eyes remained chiefly on the two tropical storms rampaging through the Gulf of Mexico.
The National Hurricane Center downgraded the first of the two weather fronts, Marco, to a tropical depression from a tropical storm overnight. That suggests its ability to cause any further trouble will be limited. However, the NHC upgraded Tropical Storm Laura to Hurricane, with landfall on the continental U.S. expected by Wednesday evening.
Over 1 million barrels a day of oil production has been shut in due to the storms, but the greatest sign of tightness has been seen in Gasoline RBOB Futures, which are at their highest since the March panic at $1.3865 a gallon. U.S. crude was up 0.2% at $42.69 a barrel, while Brent was up 0.6% at $45.91.
The American Petroleum Institute's weekly assessment of U.S. oil supplies is due as usual at 4:30 PM ET."

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale improved more than expected in August as both manufacturing and services picked up steam, a survey showed on Tuesday, boosting hopes that Europe's largest economy is set for a strong recovery following the massive coronavirus shock.
The Ifo institute said its business climate index rose to 92.6 from a downwardly revised 90.4 in July. This was the fourth monthly increase in a row and came in better than economists' expectations for 92.2.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said he expected the economy to grow by almost 7% on the quarter in the July-September period after it posted a record plunge of 9.7% in the previous three months at the height of the pandemic.
""The German economy is on the road to recovery,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement, adding that firms assessed their current business situation much more optimistically than in the previous month.
The Ifo survey recorded the strongest gains in business morale among manufacturers and service providers while sentiment among construction firms was also improving.
Wohlrabe added a note of caution, however.
""The upswing is still fragile. We have not yet reached the pre-crisis level,"" he told Reuters, saying the latest spike in new infections underlined the risk of a second wave which could derail the recovery again.
Wohlrabe also pointed out that export expectations had fallen again slightly, in a sign that doing business abroad remained difficult for many German companies.
RECORD NEW DEBT
Germany's parliament has suspended its debt brake this year to allow the government to finance its crisis response with record new debt of 217.8 billion euros ($257 billion).
The suspension, following years of balanced budgets, means the German state recorded a budget deficit of 51.6 billion euros from January to June, the statistics office said. Measured by the EU's Maastricht criteria, this is a deficit of 3.2%.
Employment has proven relatively robust during the crisis with the government's efforts to shield the labour market from the coronavirus shock with short-time work schemes paying off.
The relatively mild impact on employment has helped to stabilize household income and this in return has led to a big increase in household saving as consumers were unable to spend much during the lockdown months from mid-March until May.
The savings rate almost doubled to 20.1% in the second quarter compared with the previous year, the office said.
The German central bank expects household spending to drive a strong recovery in the third quarter, though the economy might not reach its pre-crisis level before 2022.
The government's stimulus measures include a temporary VAT cut from July to December worth up to 20 billion euros, which Berlin hopes will give household spending an additional push.
""The reopening of the economy will give the German economy a strong boost in the period from July to September,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said.
But the moment of truth may come in the autumn and winter months, which could see a wave of bankruptcies, Gitzel warned.
""In addition, the negative consequences of structural change in the automobile industry are becoming increasingly evident,"" Gitzel said, pointing to many small suppliers in the sector that are struggling to adapt to digitisation and electrification.

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - Top U.S. and Chinese trade officials have reaffirmed their commitment to a Phase 1 trade deal, which has seen China lagging on its obligations to buy American goods, giving a boost to financial markets on Tuesday.
The pledge was made in a telephone call between U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He - their first formal dialogue since early May - amid concern the deal could be on shaky ground because of worsening U.S.-China ties.
""Both sides see progress and are committed to taking the steps necessary to ensure the success of the agreement,"" the U.S. Trade Representative's office (USTR) said in a statement after what it described as a regularly scheduled call.
The call was originally expected on Aug. 15, six months after the trade deal was launched. 
But President Donald Trump, who has frequently expressed anger at China over the novel coronavirus pandemic, said last week he had postponed talks with China because ""I don't want to deal with them now.""
Washington and Beijing have traded sanctions and barbs over a growing list of issues including a new national security law imposed on Hong Kong, China's disputed territorial claims in the South China Sea, the coronavirus and U.S. accusations of national security threats posed by Chinese tech firms.
China's commerce ministry confirmed that the two sides had a ""constructive dialogue"" and agreed to continue pushing forward the implementation of the Phase 1 trade deal.
The USTR said they ""addressed steps that China has taken to effectuate structural changes"" on issues including protecting intellectual property rights, removing impediments for U.S. firms in the financial services and agriculture sectors and eliminate forced technology transfers. ""The parties also discussed the significant increases in purchases of U.S. products by China as well as future actions needed to implement the agreement,"" it said.
News of the call helped lift global stocks and Asian currencies.
""U.S.-China talks are bullish for most commodities as Trump is desperate for good news to help in the election,"" said Ole Houe, director of advisory services at agriculture brokerage IKON Commodities in Sydney
""It could lead to higher demand for U.S. products."" 
'KEEP BUYING'
Chinese purchases of U.S. goods are running well behind the pace needed to meet a first year increase of $77 billion specified in the deal, according to official data. 
While China has recently ramped up buying of farm goods including soybeans, it is far from meeting its commitment to buy $36.5 billion worth of U.S. agricultural goods under the deal - purchases that Trump has counted on to bolster his support in farm states that backed him in the 2016 election.
The United States exported just $7.274 billion in agricultural goods to China in the first half of the year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The U.S. comments ""showed that they think we are going to keep buying from the U.S., at least before the election takes place. And we will,"" an agricultural goods trader with a Chinese state-owned firm told Reuters, declining to be identified as he is not authorized to speak to media. 
""We are definitely going to maintain the stance to buy as much as possible, but it is really hard to say whether the targets can be reached."" 
Sushant Gupta, research director at the Wood Mackenzie consultancy, said it expects China to import more American LPG, propane and ethane in the second half of this year to meet petrochemical feedstock shortages, but does not expect China to be able to increase U.S. crude imports enough to meet the Phase 1 targets. 

China bought only 5% of the targeted $25.3 billion in energy products from the United States in the first half of 2020. Chinese state-owned oil firms have booked tankers to carry at least 20 million barrels of U.S. crude for August and September.

MINSK (Reuters) - The Belarusian central bank will not introduce capital controls to prevent the depreciation of the Belarusian rouble as these would be counterproductive, central bank board member Dmitry Murin told Reuters on Tuesday. 
A political crisis sparked by mass protests against President Alexander Lukashenko has dragged the rouble to record lows against the euro this week and sent Belarusians scrambling to buy foreign currency at exchange points. [nL8N2FQ1J2]
On Tuesday, the rouble weakened further, losing 1.2%-1.5% against the dollar and the euro. It has lost 30% so far this year against the euro (EURBYN=). 
But the central bank is not contemplating imposing restrictions, Murin said, adding: ""We believe that the introduction of restrictions will have the exact opposite effect."" 
Asked if the National Bank of Belarus could return to the obligatory sale of foreign exchange earnings, introduce targeted sales of foreign currency, restrict deposits or foreign exchange settlements, Murin answered in the negative.
Belarus had started lifting such restrictions five years ago.

DEBT LEVELS ""COMFORTABLE""
Belarus plunged into turmoil following Lukashenko's contested victory in an August 9 presidential election. 
His opponents say the vote was rigged, sparking waves of street protests and strikes that pose the biggest challenge to his 26-year rule. The European Union is gearing up to impose new sanctions on Minsk.
Murin said however the central bank would not artificially keep the exchange rate at any specific level, though he confirmed the central bank had conducted FX interventions in recent days. 
The country's gold and foreign exchange reserves stood at $8.857 billion at the start of August, data shows, but the interventions likely caused these to shrink, Murin acknowledged.
Despite declining reserves and some $3 billion in maturing foreign debt over the next 12 months, Murin saw debt levels as manageable. 
""The payments are quite substantial, but at the moment the foreign currency balances of the Ministry of Finance exceed the forthcoming payments by 1.6 times,"" he said. ""Overall, the debt level is within comfortable limits.""
Murin also said the outflow of deposits from banks remained moderate and if required, the central bank may consider supporting banks with forex refinancing tools.
Murin said he saw no reason for now to raise interest rates but did not exclude that possibility for the future. The main interest rate is at 7.75% and the next monetary policy meeting is due in October.

957,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 04:09AM ET</span>",Germany Closes In on Agreement to Extend Job-Preserving Aid,"(Bloomberg) -- Germany is likely to extend a state wage-support program designed to help Europe’s biggest economy weather the coronavirus crisis, according to a senior lawmaker.
Officials from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition -- meeting later on Tuesday in Berlin -- have “always taken the sensible path in the end on labor-market and social policy,” Carsten Schneider, a caucus manager for the Social Democratic Party, said in an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio.
“That’s why I think it will be agreed this evening and then sent to the lower house of parliament for approval,” Schneider said. The SPD is the junior coalition partner with Merkel’s conservative CDU/CSU bloc.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz last week proposed extending the job-preserving subsidies to 24 months, saying the measure would cost the government an extra 10 billion euros ($11.8 billion). Labor Minister Hubertus Heil, like Scholz a Social Democrat, said Friday that his impression is that both Merkel and the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, the CSU, back the plan.
The compensation program, normally limited to 12 months, was relaunched to shield workers and companies from massive job cuts during the pandemic. The benefit initially covers as much as 67% of net wages for households with children and increases over time.
Data published Tuesday confirmed that the German economy suffered a severe blow in the second quarter. Investment collapsed by 7.9% and household spending slid 10.9%, resulting in a 9.7% drop in total output. Exports registered a decline of more than 20%.
The number of short-time workers is several times higher than during the 2008-2009 recession caused by the global financial crisis, though Ifo institute economists estimate the number fell to 5.6 million in July from about 7 million in May.
“It’s still not certain how long this crisis will last, and the issue is whether we can protect jobs beyond the crisis, particularly in the manufacturing sector,” Schneider said. “Maintaining employment is a key factor in getting back to growth in the future. We can afford it, and I expect not only the unions to support it but employers as well.”

French firms' debt burdens were at record levels even before the coronavirus outbreak and many have increased borrowing to keep operations running as cashflow dwindled during the crisis.
The state has already offered to guarantee up to 300 billion euros in bank loans, but the sorry state of balance sheets at some smaller businesses has led to calls from the central bank and economists for support in the form of equity to stave off a wave of bankruptcies.
Le Maire told Les Echos business newspaper the state would guarantee 3 billion euros of loans to SMEs with a minimum duration of seven years, helping them to raise 10-15 billion euros.
The loans would be accounted for as equity on firms' books, which means they should not add to their debt burdens, and they would not confer corporate governance rights as equity usually does.
""These long-term loans are indispensable for SMEs whose debt loans are too high, holding back their development and investments,"" Le Maire said.
He added that discussions were still underway with banks on how much firms would be charged for the loans and said lenders would decide who gets them to ensure they go to companies with viable businesses.
Le Maire also said that banks had agreed to charge between 1-3% depending on loan duration after the first year for lending under the 300-billion-euro guarantee programme. During the first year, SMEs pay only 0.25% under that programme and bigger firms 0.50%.

Sun Guofeng, head of the monetary policy department at the People's Bank of China, told a press conference the central bank would not change its monetary policy direction or its flexible approach to policy.
Liquidity would also stay reasonably ample, which would allow China's economy to return to its potential growth, he said. 
""To cope with all sorts of uncertainties, the monetary policy requires greater certainty,"" said Sun, adding that China has not adopted zero or negative interest rates and other non-traditional policies such as quantitative easing. That means the PBOC does not need to deal with the complications associated with exiting such measures. 
Chinese authorities have urged banks to offer cheaper loans and cut fees to help struggling businesses hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lenders have also grappled with a surge in non-performing loans and difficulties to replenish their capital as profits fell.
Despite the pressures on the banking sector, there is no need for China to lower regulatory requirement on banks' capital adequacy ratio, Liu Guoqiang, vice governor at PBOC, told the same briefing. 
Capital adequacy ratio of the banking sector fell to 14.21% by end-June, but still remained above the regulatory standards of 10.5%, according to Liu.
""Even as capital adequacy ratio drops further in the future, we cannot lower regulatory requirements. Doing so would be fooling ourselves,"" said Liu, adding that banks should rather replenish their capital via tools such as perpetual bonds and second-tier capital. 
Mid-sized and small banks can use proceeds from local government special bonds to boost their capital, Liu said. 
On China's official digital currency, Sun from PBOC said internal tests are being conducted in Shenzhen, Suzhou, Xiongan and Chengdu, with plans for use at the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing although there was no timetable for the rollout.

960,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 02:15AM ET</span>","Pandemic may fire up Japan's inflation, doing what cenbank could not, economist says","By Leika Kihara and Takahiko Wada
TOKYO (Reuters) - The coronavirus shock is boosting the amount of money flowing into Japan's economy and may fire up inflation, achieving what years of ultra-loose monetary policy failed to do, the central bank's former top economist, Hideo Hayakawa, said on Tuesday.
The Bank of Japan has been printing money aggressively for years as part of a policy of quantitative easing, hoping to spur consumption in the world's third biggest economy and reach an elusive inflation target of 2%.
But most of the money piled up in financial institutions' reserves instead of spreading out across the economy, as risk-averse Japanese firms stayed wary of boosting spending.
After COVID-19 struck, however, the money printed by the BOJ is trickling down to households and companies, as the government ramps up spending and commercial banks boost lending to cash-strapped firms, said Hayakawa.
""Money is flowing into companies and households, leading to a surge in savings,"" Hayakawa, whose views are closely tracked by incumbent policymakers, told Reuters. ""Consumption could boom once the pandemic subsides, pushing up growth and inflation.""
Even if that scenario is not reached for years, policymakers should not assume that persistent deflation will cap bond yields, allowing Japan to run a huge fiscal deficit at low cost forever, he said.
""There's a strong belief among Japanese policymakers that prices will never perk up, and so it's okay to keep running a huge fiscal deficit,"" said Hayakawa, who is now a senior fellow at the Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research.
""But you never know how COVID-19 could affect prices. The biggest fear for the BOJ is a steady rise in inflation,"" he said, adding that such an increase would force the bank to consider whittling down stimulus without sparking an unwelcome spike in yields.
Bank lending has hit a record high in recent months as companies hoarded cash to tide over the sweeping impact of the pandemic.
Deposits also rose to a record 786 trillion yen ($7.4 trillion) in June and surged 8.3% in July from a year earlier, as households saved some of the cash doled out by the government in its steps to cushion the disease blow.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank will likely keep interest rates on hold on Thursday as the central bank weighs concerns about rising household debt and property prices with the need to support a coronavirus-hit economy.
The Bank of Korea (BOK) was expected to keep its base rate  steady at a record low of 0.50%, according to all 26 analysts surveyed by Reuters, after a total of 75 basis points rate cuts since March.
Thirteen of 15 analysts who provided forecasts for end-2021 saw the BOK holding rates throughout this year and next. One forecast a rate cut in 2021 and the other a rate hike.
South Korea's economy plunged into recession in the second quarter of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic battered exports and business activity, despite efforts by the government and the central bank to support Asia's fourth-largest economy.
""It is true that the gloomy economic condition warrants an accommodative monetary policy,"" said Kim Jina, analyst at IBK Investment & Securities. 
""But the bank will need to see whether the resurgence in COVID-19 leads to further deterioration of economic indicators, which makes any (immediate) policy action less urgent.""
This week's policy review comes as South Korea has seen a surge in coronavirus cases and is considering deploying the toughest stage of social-distancing rules, where schools and businesses would be urged to close.
But minutes from the latest BOK monetary policy meeting showed that while board members agreed rates needed to stay loose for the time being, some flagged the need to pay closer attention to financial imbalances as household debt rises along with property prices.
""Concerns regarding rising housing prices and household borrowings will hold back the BOK from easing further,"" said Defa Zhao from Continuum Economics.
The central bank is currently expecting gross domestic product to fall 0.2% this year - the worst since the 1998 financial crisis - and is expected to revise down this forecast at the meeting this week.

It announces its rate decision around 0100 GMT on Thursday and the governor's press conference will be broadcast live on YouTube from 0220 GMT.

Taiwan already has tough regulations restricting Chinese companies, and has in recent weeks ramped up actions to investigate those it suspects of operating on the island indirectly, via middlemen or overseas investment vehicles.
Taiwan plans to stop local sales of Chinese internet television streaming services, and this week gave e-commerce site Taobao Taiwan six months to re-register as Chinese-backed rather than foreign or leave the island.
Speaking to reporters, Premier Su said the government supported the moves to uphold regulations in laws governing Taiwan's relations with China, which claims the democratic island as its own sovereign territory.
Taiwan will ""not allow Chinese investment to pull a fast one, making turns at every point, like the government has no control and can't control it"", Su said.
""We have a government, and we won't do it like this.""
Taobao Taiwan has complained it is a totally different company from Taobao China, which is owned by China's  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), and does not fall under the Alibaba group.
Taiwan's government says Taobao Taiwan's British-registered operator is in effect controlled by Alibaba.
Taiwan has long been suspicious of Chinese attempts to sway its population, including by use of fake news spread online and efforts to influence Taiwan media.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian central bank president Roberto Campos Neto said on Monday that he has not been sounded out about replacing Economy Minister Paulo Guedes when he eventually leaves his post, and said the whole notion is a ""non-issue.""
In an interview with CNN Brasil, Campos Neto dismissed recent local media reports that he has been lined up to replace Guedes and said the reports only served as a distraction from getting the economy back up and running.
""My ideas are very closely aligned to Paulo Guedes'. I have never been approached. It would make no sense, given the alignment we have. I think it is a distraction,"" Campos Neto said.
Asked if he would assume the role if Guedes left, Campos Netos said that would make no sense, precisely because the two men's views on the economy and policy are so closely aligned.
""I think this is a non-issue,"" he said. 
Speculation that Guedes could quit has never been far from the surface ever since President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January last year, either due to differences of opinion with the president or frustration with the lack of progress for his sweeping orthodox, market-friendly economic and fiscal reforms.
On the issue of the public finances, an area where Campos Neto and Guedes are very closely aligned, the central bank chief said any deterioration in the fiscal outlook could prompt the bank to reevaluate its policy outlook.

Earlier on Monday, Campos Neto said economic and fiscal reforms help keep interest rates lower for longer, and that fiscal discipline anchors short- and medium-term rates.

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Monday his administration would provide an additional $1 billion to a program that provides food to American families dealing with the economic hardship from the coronavirus pandemic.
The Farmers to Families Food Box program is one of several government efforts to help struggling Americans. It aims to buy food from farmers who typically produced for restaurants but lost business because of coronavirus-related shutdowns, and deliver it to the millions of people who were thrown out of work or were otherwise hurt by the pandemic.
""Today I am proud to announce that we will provide an additional one billion dollars to fund the Farmers to Families Food Box program,"" Trump said during an visit to a North Carolina food packing plant.
Reuters reported in July that the government had delivered far less food aid under the up to $3 billion program announced in April than it had pledged by the end of June, citing food banks managers and data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
The program was criticized by food banks, analysts and some U.S. senators, who said contracts were often awarded to inexperienced vendors that were unable to source the food and deliver it in a timely manner.
According to the USDA website, the department aims to complete the purchase of up to $2.7 billion of food under the aid program by the end of August.

The White House said in a statement on Monday that under the program, more than 70 million boxes of food had been delivered to food banks and nonprofit organizations.

A survey from accounting firm KPMG showed 80% of business leaders had accelerated their digital expansion plans during the lockdown as they adjusted to staff working remotely and dealing with customers online.
There was uncertainty about the eventual scale of the shift away from shared workspaces in favour of working from home but 69% were planning to cut their office space in the short term.
""Maybe some kind of hybrid finds its way into the new everyday reality,"" Bill Thomas, KPMG International's global chairman and chief executive said.
Seventy-three percent said the shift to working from home had increased the pool of job candidates.
That could lead to teams that are more spread out globally and interact more online. 
""There's a comfort level with this that people have never had before,"" Thomas said.
Talent risk - covering recruitment and retention as well as the wellbeing and health of staff - had jumped from 11th to first in a ranking of risks over the next three years for CEOs.
Following behind were risks relating to supply chains, as trade tensions grow on the back of the pandemic, and environmental and climate change risks.
The COVID-19 crisis has split CEOs over the three-year outlook for the global economy with 32% saying they are less confident than they were at the start of the 2020 and another 32% saying they are more confident.

Proposals include a rescue package in which companies could issue bonds for future conversion to shares, as well as a capitalization program under which the government would take part ownership of businesses, Colombian Business Association President Bruce Mac Master said. 
""We're in an extraordinary situation which requires us to throw everything we have at it,"" Mac Master said at the group's annual congress. ""We should play with everything we've got.""
Colombia's companies regulator said in April the number of businesses declaring insolvency could double in the coming months due to the decline in economic activity in the wake of coronavirus. 
""It is much better to save companies than to try to find new investments; it's cheaper and we must try to do it,"" Mac Master said.
According to the Bogota and Cundinamarca chapter of the National Federation of Retailers some 58,000 businesses in the capital have shut down indefinitely, equal to 31%, while another 40% of retailers' sites are currently closed.
Mac Master also called for an increase in state subsidies to support companies to make payroll, buy-back programs and tax exemptions for the most desperate sectors. 
The government raised the possibility it could acquire stakes in companies in June, but has yet to publish further details.

A three-person panel determined that the duties, designed to counter Canadian subsidies, breached global trading rules because Washington had not shown that many prices paid by Canadian firms for timber on government-owned lands were artificially low. 
The U.S. industry has complained for decades that Canadian rivals benefit from provincial government subsidies, allowing them to sell their wood for less.
""Canada expects the United States to comply with its WTO obligations. U.S. duties on Canadian softwood lumber must not persist,"" Mary Ng, Canada's trade minister said of the decision.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer criticised the ruling in a statement, saying it prevented the United States from taking legitimate action against Canadian subsidies. 
""This flawed report confirms what the United States has been saying for years: the WTO dispute settlement system is being used to shield non-market practices and harm U.S. interests."" 
U.S. President Donald Trump has branded the WTO a ""broken"" and ""horrible"" institution and his administration has crippled the appeals process by blocking appointments to the WTO's appellate body.
The lumber dispute dates back to the 1980s and has included a previous round of WTO cases lasting from 2001 to 2006. That concluded with a settlement under which Washington suspended duties as long as lumber prices were sufficiently high.
The agreement expired in 2015, prompting the Trump administration's subsequent move to impose tariffs of up to 17.99% against what it saw as unfair subsidies for Canadian exporters of softwood lumber, which is used in home construction.

Monday's case, the ninth before the WTO in the lumber dispute, concerned subsidies. A different WTO panel last year largely upheld U.S. anti-dumping duties on Canadian lumber, prompting a Canadian appeal.

As the city slowly tries to reopen, that dropped to 12.9% in June, but many people are still trying to catch up to lost coronavirus income, advocates say. Up to 56% of Louisiana's renters are now at risk of eviction, the Aspen Institute calculates https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNzRhYjg2NzAtMGE1MC00NmNjLTllOTMtYjM2NjFmOTA4ZjMyIiwidCI6Ijc5MGJmNjk2LTE3NDYtNGE4OS1hZjI0LTc4ZGE5Y2RhZGE2MSIsImMiOjN9, the second-highest percentage of at-risk renters in the country after Mississippi.
Potentially making matters worse, Tropical Storm Marco and Tropical Storm Laura are bearing down on the Gulf of Mexico, and threaten https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-storms-lauramarco/thousands-evacuate-as-dueling-storms-take-aim-at-us-gulf-coast-idUSKBN25J0IM to flood the city again. 
KATRINA'S LASTING IMPACT 
After flooding from Hurricane Katrina damaged 70% of the city's housing stock in August 15 years ago, tens of thousands of New Orleans buildings stood blighted for years. Large public housing buildings were demolished, over residents' protests, and replaced with mixed-income housing that pushed many apartment units out of reach for the city's poor.
According to the Jane Place Neighborhood Sustainability Initiative, a housing rights organization, New Orleans rents have increased by 50% since 2000, while wages have only risen by 2%. 
More than half of the city's 390,000 residents are renters, and of those 61% are considered cost-burdened, paying more than a third of their income on rent, Jane Place calculates.
""People are paying more rent now than they've ever paid in their lives,"" said Frank Southall, lead organizer at Jane Place. ""It's not uncommon to never see a one-bedroom apartment that's in good condition for less than $1,200 in a city where the area median income for a single mother with a child (is) $25,000."" 
A CEILING IS NOT UNREASONABLE 
Amid the pandemic, housing advocates say some landlords are taking advantage of renters' vulnerable position. 
""We are seeing landlords, that if you owe them money right now, they're refusing to make necessary repairs that they're legally required to do,"" said Amanda Golob, a housing lawyer for Southeast Louisiana Legal Services. 
De Borah Wells, a 49-year-old chef who worked at the landmark Creole restaurant Commander's Palace before being furloughed in March, said her landlord threatened to evict her after she spoke up about her landlord's treatment of tenants and complained about the repairs her home needed, including the collapse of her kitchen ceiling in June. 
""I just wanted something decent. I don't feel like a ceiling is that unreasonable!"" said Wells, who negotiated with her landlord over the August rent because of the needed repairs but the deal fell through, according to correspondence between her and her lawyer. ""I can see outside from my kitchen, inside."" 
Wells took her landlord to court. On Friday, the landlord let her out of her lease, she said. The company did not respond to a request for comment. 
In Louisiana, landlords only need to give five days' notice before filing eviction notices, which they can do if payment is even one day late.
And, though landlords are supposed to make repairs to keep homes inhabitable, renters cannot withhold rent until they are made, leaving them with little recourse.
""The hard thing is, especially with low-income folks, it is difficult to move,"" Golob said, citing unreturned deposits or first month's rent and particularly COVID-19's impact on rental searches. ""Some people are staying in pretty terrible conditions because it is better than sleeping in their car.""
Brandie Barrow, a 25-year-old cook and mother of two, said she was able to stay current on her rent despite the restaurant where she works cutting her hours during the pandemic.
Still, after she complained last week of mold, maggots and mildew she found in her daughters' closet, she said her apartment complex gave her 30 days to move out. Her landlord did not respond to requests for comment left by voicemail. 
""How inhumane. Why should I have to pay for somewhere that I'm not happy?"" Barrow said.
Tammy Esponge, the executive director of the Apartment Association of Greater New Orleans, an association of rental housing owners, said she thought worries about mass evictions were overblown. 
The group had been encouraging landlords to work with residents to develop payment plans. So far, in Louisiana, the eviction rate was 5%, she said, though she acknowledged it was higher for some individual properties.
""Landlords don't want to evict. They lose money,"" said Esponge.

Nonetheless, Wells, who moved into her house last September, said she is thinking about leaving the city altogether. ""Worse case I can go back home to Chicago where my parents and boyfriend are,"" she said.

“They have created a real speculative environment,” Cooperman said Monday on Bloomberg Television. “I am uncomfortable at the present time, not because of the virus, because I’m focused on something the market isn’t focused on.

RIVERSIDE, Calif. (Reuters) - The potential loss of his life's work has kept Vince Bernard up at night, worried about whether he would be able to save his citrus farm. 
At Bernard Ranches in Riverside, California, the citrus grower saw more than 3,000 boxes of oranges rot when the coronavirus pandemic forced schools and restaurants to close in March. That loss translated into $36,000. 
""Lemon sales went from 40, 50 boxes a week to zero. And it was looking increasingly bad,"" said Bernard. 
Bernard's worst fears, however, were that his trees would die if he were not able to pay a hefty monthly water bill of $7,000. 
""I had nightmares of that,"" Bernard said.
The 68-year-old Bernard soon realized he had to knock on doors to avoid losing his crop of Valencia oranges. 
Fighting back tears, Bernard recounted how he went to his old customers and said he would be glad to sell anything at cost, half price or less to stay in business. ""I told them ... I'm desperate to keep my life's work going.""
Bernard started selling fruit in 1984. Besides distributing to local restaurants, hotels and schools, Bernard has been relying on The Fruitguys, an online business that delivers farm-fresh fruit to offices and homes nationwide.
With the farming industry suffering across the country due to the pandemic, The Fruitguys have lost 90% of their business. 
When Chris Mittelstaedt, founder of The Fruitguys, learned about Bernard's dire situation, he offered an alternative. 
""If I could get 20 weeks in a row of eight hundred bags of oranges sold for him, then that gets him closer to being able to save his ranch,"" said Mittelstaedt. 
Cesar Pascual and his family have worked at Bernard Ranches for 23 years. Pascual says watching Bernard's suffering has not been easy.
""He has made a tremendous effort in looking for ways to sell the product,"" Pascual said. 
For Bernard, he hopes to survive the pandemic and pass on his beloved trees to his grandchildren.

""I'm hopeful ... we'll keep going,"" said Bernard. ""Southern California groves, there's not very many of them left, period. I'll give this to the kids and it'll continue.""

973,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>","Brazil's GDP probably crumbled 9.4% in second quarter under coronavirus spread, Reuters poll shows","By Gabriel Burin
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Brazil's economy likely cratered 9.4% under the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in the country during the second quarter, the worst three-month period ever, a Reuters poll showed.
Economic activity began to stir again after President Jair Bolsonaro launched fiscal spending to deal with the aftermath of COVID-19, but optimism has been dented by fears this approach could derail his original austerity agenda if kept for too long.
Brazil has registered more than 3.6 million cases of the virus since the pandemic began, the world's worst coronavirus outbreak outside the United States.
The latest gross domestic product (GDP) data, due for release Sept. 1, are set to crank up a raging debate about the extent of a vast initiative that is quickly eroding the stance of Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, a Wall Street favorite.
The soaring budget deficit has stoked concerns among economists, whose warnings are adding pressure on a government already facing criticism for its handling of a health crisis that has cost almost 115,000 lives.
GDP probably collapsed 9.4% in April-June in quarter-on-quarter terms following a 1.5% drop in the first quarter, according to the median estimate of 33 economists polled Aug. 17-21. Forecasts ranged from -7.5% to -13.6%.
Almost all respondents to separate questions on the performance of GDP components viewed private spending and investment as factors dragging the economy in Q2, with incomes weakened by rising unemployment and companies holding back on capital spending.
Reflecting a nascent pickup from the initial paralysis, the estimated size of the fall in annual terms was cut for the second time, with analysts expecting a contraction of 10.7% versus a projected drop of 12.7% in May.
""Emergency aid measures helped avoid a deeper reduction in consumer spending, particularly at the end of the quarter,"" analysts at MB Associados in Sao Paulo wrote in a report last week.
Besides the contribution of higher public expenditure in Q2, analysts were expecting to see a boost from Brazil's trade driven by a large currency depreciation as the pandemic unfolded.
""Strong commodity-based sectors like agriculture and mining performed relatively well"", MB Associados said. However, the deterioration in the public accounts and its political impact are starting to hurt local markets again.
After two months of calm, the real (BRBY) was sent into a tailspin on reports that, instead of realigning the budget, officials may scrap a key spending rule that is widely seen as a cornerstone of fiscal policy.
The rule is likely to be broken in 2021, putting Guedes in a difficult spot. Last week he said he had Bolsonaro's support amid rising speculation that political demands for more spending to shore up growth could force him to quit.
Doubts about Guedes' future have grown since two more of his special secretaries left the ministry and local media reported central bank president Roberto Campos Neto was being lined up to replace him.
""A shift to the kind of austerity that would placate Mr. Guedes looks increasingly unlikely,"" Capital Economics analysts wrote in a report last week, adding he would stay on board ""for now"" after winning a tough battle in Congress.

975,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 06:52AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday, August 24th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- President Trump attacks the FDA for foot-dragging on the authorization of new drugs on the eve of the Republican convention. Epic Games gets a helping hand from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its fight against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL); and two major storms at once threaten oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, August 24th.
1. Trump lashes out at FDA
President Donald Trump accused unnamed officials of delaying the process of drug authorizations by the Food and Drug Administration in order to prevent his re-election.
Trump said “deep state” interests were “making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics. Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd.”
The comments came as the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization of convalescent plasma for treating Covid-19 patients. FDA commissioner Steven Hahn, a Trump appointee, said that the decision isn’t a full approval and that it is still evaluating it for effectiveness and safety.  
Separately, the Financial Times reported that Trump is also pushing for AstraZeneca’s experimental Covid-19 drug to get EUA.
2.  Republican convention begins, Conway departs
The Republican Party’s national convention begins with a series of remote events that will be live-streamed.
President Trump, who trails his Democratic Party rival Joe Biden in national opinion polls by some eight percentage points, is set to present his first term as an American success story derailed by what he calls the ‘China virus’, according to The Wall Street Journal.
The week began on an inauspicious note, as White House Communications chief Kellyanne Conway announced her resignation, citing family issues. Conway’s husband George has been a vocal supporter of The Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump Republican grouping.
3. Stocks set to open higher
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher, ostensibly lifted by hopes for more rapid deployment of drugs to treat Covid-19.
By 6:45 AM ET (1045 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 268 points or 1.0%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was up 0.8% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.9%.
The more optimistic tone has also pushed the dollar index back below 93. It was down 0.3% at 92.927, while gold futures were up 0.5% at 1,956.60 a troy ounce.
4. Storms threaten Gulf of Mexico oil output
Oil prices rebounded from their losses of late last week, in a movement largely driven by risk assets in other classes.
Market participants are closely watching the track of two tropical storms that have affected production in the Gulf of Mexico.
The twin threat from Hurricane Marco and Tropical Storm Marco had shut in some 58% of output in the Gulf – just over 1 million barrels a day - on Sunday, according to government information.
By 6:30 AM, U.S. crude futures were up 0.8% at $42.86 a barrel, while Brent futures were up 0.7% at $45.25
Storms tend to also disrupt demand for crude from Gulf coast refineries, so the effect on U.S. prices is rarely fully reflected in the price of benchmark contracts.
5. Epic gets a helping hand from Microsoft
Epic Games gained an important ally in its fight against Apple and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) at the weekend, as Microsoft said in a court filing that letting Apple block Epic’s developer account would badly hit game makers by stopping them from using Epic’s Unreal Engine.
The Unreal Engine, which powers Fortnite and other games, is a suite of technologies that provides a framework for making 3D graphics.
Epic licenses the engine to companies – including Microsoft - that use the technology.
Microsoft’s statement was filed as part of a lawsuit brought by Epic against Apple over its insistence on a 30% cut of in-app purchases. A hearing in a California district court is scheduled for later Monday afternoon."

(Reuters) - Companies raised the most funds in global equity and debt markets for the month of August in a decade as homebound bankers spend their summer fixing deals off the back of trillions of dollars of stimulus worldwide to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
Companies have raised $65.5 billion through initial public offerings (IPOs) and high-yield bond issuances globally so far in August, the highest for that month in at least 10 years, according to Refinitiv data. They raised $98.6 billion in July and $126.5 billion in June, which was the highest in 20 years. 
Graphic: Monthly global IPO proceeds https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkpllgrapb/Monthly%20global%20IPO%20proceeds.jpg
It comes as governments and central banks have made at least $15 trillion of stimulus available to help economies withstand the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic..
The fact that bankers and investors were working during the traditional August holiday month, due to coronavirus travel restrictions, also made it easier for deals to be executed, corporate advisors said.
""The liquidity in financial markets is the key point driving the number of deals we have seen in August,"" said Rishi Jalan,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s co-head of Asia debt syndicate, noting the pandemic had helped speed up the corporate deal process in some ways.
""People have adapted to the current environment very spontaneously. Roadshows have been turned into calls and investors are making themselves available very quickly, people are engaging with deals at short notice."" 
Graphic: Country wise breakdown of IPOs https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopaqnxbpa/Country%20wise%20breakdown%20of%20IPO.jpg
In Asia, there were $25.3 billion worth of equity deals so far this month, the highest in August in four years, the Refinitiv data showed.
Some $13 billion worth of U.S.-dollar denominated debt meanwhile was issued in Asia over the past three weeks, the most for August in three years, the data showed.
""There has been a lot of liquidity in the system and that has kept activity going, that has helped convince investors there is enough support in the system that they can regain confidence to deploy their cash again,"" said UBS APAC head of global banking, Gaetano Bassolino.

Grain trader Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM)'s recent deal to raise $850 million by selling a $550 million stake in Singapore's Wilmar and a $300 million exchangeable bond in the company would have been unlikely in any other August, the corporate advisors said.
""Typically in the summer months the risk is some key individuals are out on annual leave and that may impact some transactions,"" said Alan Roch, head of Asia bond syndicate at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) in Hong Kong. ""But that is not the case in 2020, pretty much everyone is working."" 
Graphic: Sector wise breakdown of IPOs https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxxolgpx/Sector%20wise%20breakdown%20of%20IPO.jpg 
Refinitiv data showed that technology and healthcare firms were among the top issuers of equity and debt offerings globally this year while travel services, hotels, and brick-and-mortar retailers lagged.

David Spreng, chief executive officer at venture capital firm Runway Growth Capital, said he expected a fair amount of M&A activity in coming quarters as companies raise money aggressively.
""Those who want to be the buyers rather than being eaten, want to make sure they have a strong balance sheet,"" he said.
""And even if you are likely to be a seller, you want to make sure you enter into that negotiation with a strong position as much as you can.""

978,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 03:21AM ET</span>",Safe bet? Sovereign funds rethink once-reliable real estate,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic has forced sovereign wealth funds to think the previously unthinkable.
With prime office blocks lying empty around the world, hotels half-vacant and retailers struggling to stay afloat, the funds are retreating from many of the real estate investments that have long been a mainstay of their strategies.
Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) invested $4.4 billion in the sector in the first seven months of 2020, 65% down from the same period a year ago, according to previously unpublished data provided to Reuters by Global SWF, an industry data specialist.
The nature of property investments is also shifting, with funds increasingly investing in logistics space, such as warehousing, amid a boom in online commerce during the pandemic, while cutting back on deals for offices and retail buildings.
Such shifts in behaviour can have seismic effects on the global real estate market, given such funds are among the largest investors in property and have interests worth hundreds of billions of dollars in total. Three sovereign funds sit within the top 10 largest real estate investors, according to market specialists IPE Real Assets.
A big question is whether the changes are structural for the funds, for which property is an asset-class staple at about 8% of their total portfolios on average, or a temporary response to a huge, unexpected and unfamiliar global event. 
""Real estate is still a big part of sovereign wealth fund portfolios and will continue to be so,"" said Diego López, managing director of Global SWF and a former sovereign wealth fund adviser at PwC.
""What COVID has accelerated is the sophistication of SWFs trying to build diversification and resilience into their portfolio - and hence looking for other asset classes and industries.""
Sovereign funds have been more bearish on property than public pension funds, another big investor in the sector, Global SWF found. While they have outstripped the pension funds in overall investment across most industries and assets this year, by two to one, that ratio is reversed for real estate.

https://graphics.reuters.com/SWF-REALESTATE/dgkpllmyopb/chart.png
FUTURE OF THE OFFICE
Funds are nursing hits to their existing property portfolios stemming from the introduction of lockdowns and social-distancing restrictions. While other parts of their portfolio, such as stocks and bonds, have rebounded from March's trough, a real-estate recovery is less assured. 
Property capital value globally is expected to drop by 14% in 2020 before rising by 3.4% in 2021, according to commercial real estate services group CBRE. Analysts and academics question whether the pandemic's impact may prove long-lasting, with more people working from home and shopping online.
""I think there's a real threat to some commercial business districts in the big cities as I can't see us all return to the 9-to-5 schlep in, schlep out,"" said Yolande Barnes, a real-estate specialist at London university UCL.
The value of property assets of some funds has fallen in 2020, with those experiencing the biggest drops including Singapore's Temasek Holdings and GIC, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), according to data compiled for Reuters by industry tracker Preqin. 
Those four funds have collectively seen the value of such assets drop by $18.1 billion to $132.9 billion, the data showed.
Reuters was unable to confirm whether the fall was due to lower valuations or asset sales. The funds either declined to comment or did not respond.
Many sovereign funds do not publicly disclose data on property investments, with Norway's one of the exceptions.
The Norwegian fund, which has around $49 billion invested in real estate, up from $47 billion at the end of 2019, said last week its unlisted property portfolio returned minus 1.6% in the first half of 2020.
Sovereign funds have also largely steered clear in 2020 of new direct investments in London or Los Angeles, hotspots in normal times, according to property services firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), which said SWFs were ""on the defensive"". 
LOGISTICS AND BIOTECH
The funds' advance in logistics properties, such as warehousing and goods distribution centres, comes at a time of high demand as people have bought everything from toilet paper to trainers from home during lockdowns. 
So far this year, logistics have accounted for about 22% of funds' real-estate investments by value, compared with 15% in 2019 as a whole, the Global SWF data shows. 
Meanwhile, investments in offices have fallen to 36% from 49% last year, and in retail property to zero versus 15%.
Marcus Frampton, chief investment officer at the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation (APFC), told Reuters that real-estate deal volumes had ""slowed down substantially"" in general, but that, anecdotally, he saw activity in industrial facilities like logistics and ""multi-family"" apartment blocks.
The wealth fund's holdings have risen to $4.7 billion, up from $4 billion at the end of June, after the purchase of multi-family and industrial REIT stocks on July 1, Frampton said.
""Commercial warehouse activity is strong,"" he added.
In a sign of the times, Temasek participated in a $500 million investment in Indonesia-based e-commerce firm Tokopedia in June.
In contrast, physical retail, a significant part of many funds' holdings, has been hit hard. QIA-owned luxury retailer Harrods in London has reportedly forecast a 45% plunge in annual sales, as visitor numbers plummet. Many other retailers have sought to renegotiate rents.
The outlook appears brighter for some fledgling sectors such as biotech, which has come to the fore during the pandemic.
""We have seen significant demand for life sciences space. That's ranged from office to specialist lab and warehouse space,"" said Alistair Meadows, JLL's head of UK capital markets.

DISTRESSED OPPORTUNITIES
The U.S. office market is expected to face its first year since 2009 of more space becoming vacant than leased, according to CBRE.
Still, investors are betting on a rebound of sorts in some quarters. For example, Canary Wharf Group, partly owned by the QIA, unveiled plans last month for a large new mixed-use development, including business space, in London's financial district.
And while hotels face huge challenges, occupancy rates are expected to rebound near to pre-COVID levels - but not until the end of 2021.
The Libyan Investment Authority has experienced problems with the operating expenses of some of its properties, including some hotels in Africa owned by its subsidiary, Chairman Ali Mahmoud Hassan Mohamed told Reuters.
But it remains committed to its real-estate portfolio, estimated at $6.6 billion in its latest valuation in 2012, as it was able to restore its value, he said.
Crises can also present opportunities, however.
In the aftermath of the pandemic, some funds may look for bargains as distressed properties emerge. 
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which operates a fund, told Reuters it would ""closely monitor market conditions with a view to capturing appropriate opportunities"".
And in an uncertain world, some academics argue that property remains a solid bet for savvy investors.
Barnes of UCL said sovereign funds could be ""lighter on their feet"" than some other institutional funds and more able to adjust their behaviour to suit changing circumstances.

""Real estate is one of the better sectors to be in, in a world of turmoil,"" she added. ""But it's very much about picking the right real estate.""

979,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 02:50AM ET</span>",Hong Kong buyers rush for UK properties after security law,"By Clare Jim and William James
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - Hong Konger Winnie Tong aims to move to Britain with her family in two years, but is stalling on plans to buy a house there after prices jumped almost 15% since April.
The 40-year-old who used to be in two minds about leaving Hong Kong now wants to settle in Birmingham as she is concerned about an increasingly politicised environment for her young children.
""Last year because of the anti-extradition law protests I wanted to migrate more, and it's pretty much this year, because of the national security law that I'm determined to move.""
Property agents said they sold more than double the number of apartments to Hong Kong buyers in the past two months, with the spike in purchases mainly for personal use.
""The good quality houses are all sold out and prices are more expensive,"" Tong told Reuters. ""Too many Hong Kong people are snatching up (property) in the UK now."" 
The UK government in July offered about 3 million British National Overseas passport holders in Hong Kong a path to British citizenship after Beijing imposed sweeping new security legislation in Hong Kong. 
""We have never received so many calls from existing clients,"" said Marc von Grundherr, director of London estate agent Benham and Reeves, which lets UK properties for about 1,000 clients in Hong Kong.
A weaker pound  since 2014 and a stamp duty holiday in Britain for homes priced below 500,000 pounds ($654,400), have also encouraged Hong Kong buyers to invest in the UK.
Property agent Arlington Residential in London said it completed more than 10 deals in the past two months, a figure it would normally achieve in a year. Centaline in Hong Kong said it sold around 60 apartments in July alone, adding that they had a waiting list of clients due to a shortage of supply.
Hong Kong investors buy homes anywhere from 300,000 pounds to 50 million pounds ($390,000-$65.50 million) and are increasingly looking outside London, such as in Manchester and Bristol, for cheaper options.
""Because of the situation in Hong Kong, those who didn't know the UK very well are now also looking...and they don't want to commit too much yet because their economic power is not as strong,"" said David Hui, Centaline Property sales director.
Hong Kong buyers have climbed a notch to become the fifth largest foreign investors in central London in the past 12 months, Knight Frank data showed, after China, the United States, India and Russia. They accounted for 4% of purchases, up from 2.5% in 2016. 
Guy Bradshaw, head of London Residential at Sotheby's International Realty UK, said Hong Kong buyers are nervous about the political situation and want to ensure their families are safe and their income is protected.

980,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>",Battle-scarred creditors call for reforms from LatAm default duo,"By Tom Arnold and Rodrigo Campos
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As serial defaulters Argentina and Ecuador near the finishing line on their latest sovereign debt overhauls, foreign creditors are nervy about investing again without macroeconomic reforms and International Monetary Fund support.
On the surface, the prospects for both countries look brighter. Absent complicated negotiations with the IMF, a clean slate post-debt restructuring will allow them to focus on reviving their COVID-19-ravaged economies with much less concern about looming foreign debts to repay.
But both governments will be painfully aware they need to woo back investor support to ensure their path to recovery - not an easy challenge given their tarnished track-records that combine for about 20 defaults.
Argentina's government hopes to wrap up its latest $65 billion debt restructuring by end-August. Ecuador, having gained support for its plan relatively quickly, is also finalising its $17.4 billion foreign debt revamp.
""In of itself, these deals are a positive first step but there is a lot more work to be done to firm up the outlook for investment,"" said Graham (NYSE:GHM) Stock, an emerging markets strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, and a creditor to both countries.
""There's plenty of goodwill (from creditors) but there's a question of (government) actions rather than just good intentions.""
Most immediately focus will turn to engagement with the IMF.
Ecuador's deal was predicated on a fresh agreement with the IMF, giving many investors faith in the commitment of President Lenin Moreno's administration to revamp the stalled $4.2 billion IMF lending programme.

Argentina's talks may be trickier. Economy Minister Martin Guzman has warned of ""tough"" negotiations that may not lead to a deal on a new program until early 2021.
""It's going to be a very difficult discussion,"" said Mauro Roca, emerging markets sovereign research managing director at TCW.
""The IMF will ask for some policy conditionality and Argentina at this point doesn't seem willing to accept important changes in the direction of policy. That would be seen as interventionist, so that discussion is going to be difficult and it’s going to take a while.""
Ecuador's sovereign bonds have generally outperformed Argentina's since May, which analysts said partly reflected Quito's friendlier talks with creditors.

POLITICAL WILL
Hopes of generating economic revival while ensuring debt sustainability - expected to stabilise at about 100% of GDP in Argentina's case - hinges on politics.
""It's going to depend on the macroeconomic conditions and the policy regime, particularly the direction of economic policy,"" TCW's Roca said. ""If those policies are not considered to be sustainable nobody would put money to work, particularly in FDI or something that requires looking down the road.""
A ""glass half-full"" scenario could see Argentina at the start of a virtuous circle, propelled by the ""right policy mix"" initiated by a Alberto Fernandez administration that had more political capital than his predecessor Mauricio Macri could have dreamed of, said Patrick Esteruelas, head of research at EMSO Asset Management.
""The problem is that glass half full is full of holes,"" he said. ""The historical fiscal multiplier in Argentina is very low which means any debt service relief does not translate into real activity gains. You need to see wholesale changes to a medium-term economic program that I don't think this government, despite its political capital, is willing to endorse.""
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said it was sceptical about prospects for comprehensive tax reform.
In Ecuador's case, investors are wary after unsuccessful attempts last year by Moreno to push through tax and monetary reforms intended to cut a burdensome fiscal deficit with elections coming up in 2021.
""With elections round the corner, and with the COVID-19 impact, the space and willingness to undertake difficult measures could be lower,"" said Raza Agha, head of emerging markets credit strategy at Legal & General Investment Management.
Currency woes raise another red flag as locals have piled savings into the U.S. dollar in recent years.
Argentina could see more foreign exchange controls amid still latent dollar demand, said Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed income strategy at Amherst Pierpont Securities.
Lack of domestic confidence in Argentina's peso was a ""massive problem"" that needed fixing before investment would flow properly, said Carl Ross of GMO.
The currencies of both nations were overvalued, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) said this month, and real depreciation was needed to prevent unsustainable current account deficits.
It might be hard for Argentina to correct overvaluation unless the government allowed it to float more freely, the IIF said.
""Ecuador faces the tallest challenge, as dollarization makes relative price adjustments unavoidable,"" it added.

Two-thirds of panelists said the economy is still in the recession that started in February, while nearly 80% indicated that there is at least a one-in-four chance of a double-dip recession. The NABE survey summarizes the responses of 235 members and was conducted between late July and early August.
A majority of panelists said they believe Congress should extend supplemental unemployment insurance and the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, with 22% indicating that the next fiscal package should be $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion.
After Congress failed to agree on a new stimulus package, letting the extra $600 a week in unemployment assistance expire, President Donald Trump announced in early August that he would redirect disaster-relief funds to provide federal aid to the unemployed by executive action.
While 40% of respondents rate the fiscal response by Congress as “insufficient,” 37% said it’s “adequate.” At the same time, more than 75% of panelists said the Federal Reserve monetary policy is currently “about right,” the strongest approval in more than 13 years.

982,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 23, 2020 10:54PM ET</span>",Biggest Thai Pension Fund Buys Foreign Stocks to Boost Gains,"(Bloomberg) -- Thailand’s Government Pension Fund plans to boost its overseas investments, especially in the tech sector, as domestic equities offer limited options for the 1 trillion baht ($32 billion) asset manager.
“Disruptions in the technology and digital industries will still be the major driving force in the post-pandemic world,” Srikanya Yathip, secretary-general of Government Pension Fund, said in an interview at her office Thursday. “Those sectors should deliver very good returns, which are easier to find in international markets than in Thailand.”
Srikanya this month was promoted to head of the state fund, which oversees the retirement savings for more than 1 million government employees. Her jobs before joining GPF included stints at private companies such as ad agency Chua Senko Pcl and TV Asahi, according to the fund’s website.
Southeast Asia’s second-biggest economy and other regional peers have lagged the global equity rally due to their underexposure to the tech industry, including online gaming, automation and e-commerce.
Lack of Tech Leaves Southeast Asia Indexes Unloved by Investors
The 50 largest stocks in the 603-member SET Index account for 71% of total market value. Information and communication technology companies account for about a tenth of Thailand’s market capitalization, data compiled by Bloomberg show, compared with industry weightings of about a third for the S&P 500 Index and about a fourth of the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.
The gauge of Thai phone operators, game developers and other technology companies has dropped 13% this year compared with a 9.7% gain in the MSCI Asia Information Technology Index.
Srikanya’s plan to step up international investments is a continuation of the fund’s recent strategy. About 9.5% of total assets are now in foreign equities, almost double the 5.1% at the end of March, she said, without identifying specific holdings. The proportion of domestic shares is little changed this year at 4%, she said.
The fund has “positive” gains from its investments so far this year, which faced very “tough” investment climate, Srikanya said, without elaborating. It posted a return of 5.7% in 2019, compared with an average annual gain of 4.3% in the previous five years, according to its website.
Still, the investment team faces a challenge to generate higher returns because about 78% of GPF holdings are in local and overseas bonds, on which yields have slumped, she added.
The GPF will also step up its emphasis on environmental, social and governance practices when making investments under her leadership, she said. It will avoid companies and securities that don’t meet requisite ESG standards, she said.

983,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 23, 2020 09:18PM ET</span>",China Investors Brace for Record Defaults in Risky End to 2020,"(Bloomberg) --
China’s fragile economic recovery is ushering in a dangerous new phase for the nation’s $4.1 trillion corporate bond market.
With the economy now strong enough for policy makers to dial back financial support but still too weak to save the most distressed borrowers, some fund managers are bracing for defaults on domestic Chinese debt to hit record highs this year. Delinquencies have already started rising after a remarkably quiet second quarter, and pressure on borrowers is set to grow as 3.65 trillion yuan ($529 billion) of notes mature by year-end.
While few see a crisis in the offing, debt specialists at SC Lowy and Adamas Asset Management are becoming more selective in China, arguing that the government-induced calm in local credit markets is unlikely to last. Analysts say non-state companies, lower-rated developers and some local government financing vehicles are particularly vulnerable as borrowing costs climb and refinancing becomes more difficult.
“The government has neither the firepower nor the will to backstop it all,” said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer at Adamas Asset Management in Hong Kong, adding that he expects onshore defaults in China to reach a new annual record. That would mean another 72.2 billion yuan of delinquencies by the end of December, according to data compiled Bloomberg.
Local defaults so far this year have been strikingly rare, considering that the Covid-19 pandemic plunged China’s economy into its worst contraction in decades during the first quarter. Onshore delinquencies fell 17% in the first half to 49 billion yuan, in part because the government encouraged lenders to refinance debt, accept payment delays, or find other solutions such as swapping bonds for fresh notes with longer maturities.

Authorities’ outsized focus on avoiding defaults now appears to be easing as the economy bottoms out and the threat of market contagion wanes, a policy stance that aligns with the government’s long-term goal of improving the financial system’s pricing of risk. Chinese companies reneged on 10.4 billion yuan of notes in July and about the same amount so far in August, with luxury home developer Tahoe Group Co. among the latest to miss payments.
“We have seen a somewhat illusory improvement in ‘defaults’ this year, but drilling deeper the picture is less comforting,” said Owen Gallimore, head of credit strategy at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore.
Gallimore predicts China’s onshore bond market will catch up with the trend offshore, where defaults on dollar debt tracked by Bloomberg have already exceeded last year’s total by 55%. He said funding stress will likely be concentrated in non-state borrowers and may impact more property firms, which account for the bulk of China’s high-yield bond issuance.
The nation’s developers need to refinance or repay 199.3 billion yuan of onshore debt and $12.3 billion of offshore notes before year-end, data compiled by Bloomberg show. And they’ll have to come up with the cash while also adhering to issuance guidelines introduced this month that restrict the size of bond offerings by property companies in China’s interbank market to 85% of outstanding debt coming due.
Even as authorities grow more tolerant of defaults, they’re unlikely to turn off the credit taps entirely. On Aug. 17, the People’s Bank of China added 700 billion yuan of one-year funding via its medium-term lending facility, more than offsetting upcoming maturities in a move that Citic Securities Co. described as more accommodative than expected.
Read more: PBOC Adds Cash to Ease Liquidity Stress
The upshot for bond investors is that security selection now matters far more than it did earlier this year, according to Soo Cheon Lee, chief investment officer at SC Lowy, a global banking and asset management group in Hong Kong. Smaller companies and borrowers experiencing commodity-driven or industry-related stress -- such as airlines and hotels -- will likely remain under pressure, Lee said.
In just the past week, companies including Haikou Meilan International Airport Co., cruise ship operator Genting Hong Kong Ltd. and transportation leasing firm Bohai Leasing Co. have issued fresh warnings that they may struggle to repay creditors.
At least ten Chinese companies that won investor approval to delay servicing their debt after the virus outbreak will face payment deadlines in the next eight months; and at least 83 firms with $46.3 billion of bonds outstanding face uncertainty over meeting their obligations, according to company statements and rating firms, the highest number of borrowers since Bloomberg began tracking the figures in January 2019.
China’s ratio of interest-bearing corporate debt to gross domestic product has climbed by 13 percentage points this year to 164.4% at the end of June, according to the National Institution for Finance & Development, a think tank.
Local government financing vehicles have also been piling debt, selling the equivalent of $361.1 billion in domestic and offshore bonds so far this year. Questions over whether they’ll be able to repay it all intensified this month after an LGFV from northeastern Jilin province wired funds to bondholders later than usual -- a sign of potential difficulties in securing the cash.
Jilin is just one of several Chinese provinces that face higher LGFV repayment risks, according to Li Yuze, an analyst at China Merchants Securities. Others include Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan, Li said.
Whether investors have adequately priced the risk of rising defaults is debatable. Corporate yields onshore have edged up from the lowest levels in more than a decade in May, but they’re still well below long-term averages, according to ChinaBond indexes. Spreads between lower- and higher-rated credits are also near the tight end of their historical range.“We think liquidity in the credit market will continue, but we need to be mindful that the underlying cash flow and fundamentals of companies are still very weak,” SC Lowy’s Lee said. “We see a lot of landmines out there.”

985,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2020 01:55PM ET</span>","Republicans, Democrats trade blame for stalled U.S. coronavirus aid legislation","By David Lawder and Ted Hesson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top Democrats and Republicans blamed each other for stalled talks on coronavirus aid legislation on Sunday, a day after the House of Representatives approved $25 billion in new funds for the U.S. Postal Service, a bill that Republicans declared dead.
The Democratic-led House passed the bill on Saturday in a special session called by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to prevent dwindling Postal Service funding and planned service cuts from interfering with delivery of mail-in ballots for the Nov. 3 election.
But the vote failed to shift a stalemate over the next phase of coronavirus aid since Aug. 6, when talks between the White House and Democratic congressional leaders broke down over funding levels and unemployment benefits. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Republican-controlled chamber would ""absolutely not pass"" the postal bill.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on Sunday criticized the Democratic vote as ""a largely messaging bill"" and blamed Pelosi for failing to agree on broader legislation that included supplemental unemployment benefits. He had, however, reached out to Pelosi's office on Saturday.
""I haven't heard from the speaker yet. I am going to make a phone call to her today,"" Meadows said on ABC's ""This Week"". ""My challenge to the speaker this morning would be this: If we agree on five or six things, let's go ahead and pass those.""
He said President Donald Trump would be willing to sign such a bill that includes postal service reform and funding. The Trump administration had previously offered $10 billion in additional postal funding, but the two sides remain far apart on overall funding levels.
Pelosi shot back on CNN's ""State of the Union"", saying that the postal bill addressed ""an emergency immediately and it’s something that should be bipartisan.""
""The public is demanding action on this now,"" Pelosi said. 
She also said Trump was stalling needed coronavirus relief for cities and children for political gain, signaling that negotiations were likely to make little progress during the Republican National Convention, which gets underway this week.
""This is like ancient Rome. Trump fiddles while Rome burns, while America burns,"" Pelosi said. ""And Trump gives bread and circuses without the bread. So we’ll see the circus this week with his convention.""
House Democrats passed a $3 trillion stimulus bill in May that included substantial aid to state and local governments and extension of $600-a-week in federal supplemental unemployment benefits, which are now expired. Pelosi has largely stuck to those demands in talks with Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
The two Republican officials had initially offered only $1 trillion in new coronavirus funds, lacking state and local aid with only $400 a week in unemployment benefit. Trump has since signed an executive order extending benefits at that level and deferring payment of some payroll taxes but implementation details are unclear.

Meadows told Fox News Sunday that he hoped that Republican senators would take up the House Postal Service bill and amend it to ""actually address many of the things that are hurting America right now in terms of this pandemic response and be able to get it to the president's desk.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Effective unemployment in Australia will climb above 13% by the end of September, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Sunday, as nearly half a million people lose their jobs due to a full lockdown of the country's second most populous city.
Releasing modelling from Australia's Treasury Department, Frydenberg said effective unemployment totalled 9.9% at the end of July, down from the record high of 14% in April when large parts of the country's economy were ordered to close to slow the spread of COVID-19.
But demonstrating the economic impact of Australia's second wave of COVID-19 infections, Frydenberg said the number of people out of work will swell by 450,000 during August and September amid a lockdown of nearly five million people in Victoria state capital, Melbourne.
“We know the road to recovery will be bumpy as we have seen with the setback in Victoria, however, the jobs recovery across the rest of the country gives cause for optimism,"" Frydenberg said in an emailed statement.
Once heralded as a global leader in combating COVID-19, Australia has seen a surge of new infections in the past month. 
Desperate to contain the spread, Victoria state earlier this month imposed a nightly curfew across Melbourne, tightened restrictions on movement and ordered large parts of the state's economy to close.

Australia has largely avoided the high casualty numbers of many other nations, it has recorded nearly 25,000 COVID-19 infections and 502 deaths.

The newspaper cited a Labour Ministry paper as saying the allowance, which covers some of the salary shortfall, will be extended to March 22, 2022.
Members of the ruling coalition will meet on Tuesday to hammer out the details and find a solution, as the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) are expected to reject the proposal.
Short-time work, or Kurzarbeit, is a form of state aid that allows employers to switch employees to shorter working hours during an economic downturn to keep them on the payroll. It aims to prevent shocks such as the coronavirus crisis from leading to mass unemployment.
BamS said that under the ministry plan, the extension will also apply to the gradual increase of the allowance after four and seven months, which will incur additional costs of around 300 million euros ($354 million), BamS said.
The Kurzarbeit extension is expected to cost the government up to 10 billion euros.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz proposed a week ago doubling the period over which the allowance is paid in an effort to prevent unemployment surging further during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Labour Ministry, in emailed comments, said that Heil had repeatedly argued in favour of an extension of short-time work schemes, adding talks about specifics were ongoing.

Investing.com - Investors will be on the lookout for any hints this week from the Federal Reserve about how much it could do to help the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The economic calendar features updates on durable goods and home sales. Political developments will remain on the radar as the Republican convention kicks off on Monday, with Congress still locked in a stalemate about what measures should be included in the next round of fiscal stimulus. It could be another big week for stock markets after the S&P 500 recouped all its coronavirus-driven losses and ended at Friday at record highs. Meanwhile, energy traders will be closely following two tropical storms heading into the Gulf of Mexico. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
Investors will be looking for indications on how the Fed will try to manage the long-term economic recovery in a speech by Chairman Jay Powell on the opening day of the annual Jackson Hole conference on Thursday.
Since the global financial crisis, Fed chiefs have used their keynote speech at the Jackson Hole conference - being held virtually this year for the first time in nearly four decades because of the pandemic - to signal important shifts in monetary policy or the economic outlook.
A major question - particularly ahead of the Fed's September policy meeting - is whether the central bank will shift its inflation targets to an average, which would allow inflation to run higher before interest rates are raised.
Investors may also be on the lookout for signs that the Fed is looking at additional ways to bolster the economy should Congress fail to deliver a new pandemic relief package.
The U.S. is to release data on July durable goods orders on Wednesday which is expected to show growth remained solid last month as the economy reopened.
Market watchers will also be keeping an eye on figures for new and pending home sales on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. Real estate has been one of the bright spots of the economy during the pandemic with mortgage rates near record lows.
The economic calendar also features updates on personal income and spending, consumer confidence and consumer sentiment, along with Thursday’s weekly look at initial jobless claims. Claims unexpectedly rose back above the 1-million-mark last week’s report showed, a setback for a struggling U.S. job market.
Markets will continue to follow developments in Washington as the Republican nominating convention for President Donald Trump gets underway on Monday. The convention is expected to culminate in a live acceptance speech from Trump on Thursday night on the South Lawn of the White House.
At last week’s Democratic convention speaker after speaker characterized Trump’s four years in office as chaotic. Trump countered on Friday that Democrats, not he, would bring chaos to the United States if Joe Biden wins the White House in November.
The conventions are happening against a background of a stalemate in talks between House Democrats and the White House over the next coronavirus aid bill as about 28 million Americans continue to collect unemployment checks.
Last week was a big week for stocks, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closing at record highs on Friday after the S&P 500 recouped all its losses caused by the coronavirus-driven slump. The Dow is still 6% below its all-time high in February.
Spurred by Fed buying of assets, stocks have rallied to record highs, while bond yields have been near record lows.
This week investors will await further clarity from the Fed on what more it can do to help the recovery, including details on possible changes to how it targets inflation.
On Saturday oil producers began to shut down some crude production ahead of tropical storms Laura and Marco that are forecast to hit the Gulf of Mexico in coming days.
Storms Marco and Laura are poised to become hurricanes and make back-to-back landfalls along the central Gulf Coast by mid-week. It is rare to have two simultaneous storms in the region, but neither storm is expected to become a major hurricane, and their potential tracks cover a wide area of the Gulf Coast, said forecasters.
U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore wells account for 17% of total U.S. crude oil production and 5% of total U.S. natural gas production. The region along the Texas to Mississippi coasts also accounts for 45% of total U.S. petroleum refining capacity.

An Irish minister resigned and a number of other lawmakers were disciplined on Friday after they were among more than 80 guests at a hotel dinner hosted by parliament's golf society, the night after COVID-19 restrictions were significantly tightened.
Hogan also attended the event in the west of Ireland that has caused public outrage and is under police investigation for alleged breaches of public health regulations. He apologised on Friday and said he attended on the clear understanding that it would comply with guidelines.
""The Taoiseach (prime minister) and the Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) did speak with Commissioner Hogan today and asked him to consider his position,"" a government spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. 
""They both believe that the event should never have been held, that the Commissioner's apology came late and that he still needs to give a full account and explanations of his actions.""
Irish national broadcaster RTE quoted a spokesperson for Hogan as saying there would be no response this evening to the call that he consider his position.
""We will reflect on that,"" the spokesperson added.
Hogan's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Hogan, a former minister from Deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael party, was appointed to the Commission's agriculture brief in 2014 and given the influential position of trade chief upon his reappointment last year.
Hogan has led trade talks with the United States and has a key role in negotiations over Britain's post-Brexit trading relationship with the bloc. 

He considered a bid to become the next director-general of the World Trade Organization in June before deciding against running.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, in a Fox News interview airing Sunday, raised the possibility of decoupling the U.S. economy from China, a major purchaser of U.S. goods.
In a video excerpt, Trump initially told interviewer Steve Hilton ""we don't have to"" do business with China, and then later said about decoupling: ""Well it's something that if they don't treat us right I would certainly, I would certainly do that.""
Trump entered into a high-stakes trade war with China before reaching a partial Phase 1 trade deal in January. Trump has since shut the door on Phase 2 negotiations, saying he was unhappy with Beijing's handling of the pandemic.

In June U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said a decoupling of the U.S. and Chinese economies will result if U.S. companies are not allowed to compete on a fair and level basis in China's economy.

A large crowd marched in the streets outside Netanyahu's official residence, waving signs and flags and calling for his resignation. Some protesters clashed with police, who arrested at least seven people. One police officer was injured.
The protest movement has gained traction in the summer months, with critics accusing Netanyahu of being distracted by a corruption case against him while COVID-19 cases have spiked. He denies wrongdoing.
On Friday Israel passed 100,000 reported coronavirus cases. It has recorded 809 COVID-19 deaths among its 9 million population. The country is in a recession and unemployment hovers above 20%.
Netanyahu has condemned the demonstrations against him, accusing protesters of trampling democracy and the Israeli media of encouraging them. He has argued that Israel's economy is better positioned than many developed countries hit by the global pandemic. 

Saturday's protest comes just days before an Aug. 25 deadline for the government to pass a state budget. A failure to do so will lead to general elections.

The number of companies registered to pay social security by the end of July was 1,282,346, according to figures from the Ministry of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration, or 91,240 fewer firms than in February before the government imposed a strict lockdown to try to contain COVID-19.
However, the statistics showed that since the easing of lockdown started in May, 49,159 companies have registered with the government.
This is just over half the number which closed when the pandemic was at its height in March and April.
The worst affected sectors of the economy between February and July were education, where 22.6% of companies closed, and agriculture and fishing, in which 15.2% of firms stopped trading, the government data showed.
The number of cases of COVID-19 has been rising steadily since the end of lockdown in June.

Spain diagnosed 3,650 coronavirus infections, the health ministry said on Friday, bringing the cumulative total to 386,054. The death toll was 28,838.

BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and the European Union on Friday announced a mini-deal valued at around $200 million to cut import tariffs on a small range of products, including U.S. lobsters, in a sign of easing transatlantic trade tensions.
The two, who have been at odds over aircraft subsidies and U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of punitive tariffs on EU steel and aluminum, announced the deal in a joint statement.
""The importance of the deal is that it has unleashed positive results elsewhere,"" an EU official said.
Under the agreement, the EU will remove tariffs of 8%-12% on imports of lobsters, while the United States will halve its duties on imports of certain glassware, ceramics, disposable lighters and prepared meals.
To comply with World Trade Organization rules, the lowered and removed tariffs will apply to all WTO members, although the products have been chosen so as to maximize the mutual benefits.
The whole deal is worth some 168 million euros ($198 million), based on 2019 trade. The EU imported some 42 million euros of U.S. lobsters and exported to the United States 126 million euros of the other products involved. The apparent mismatch is partly because the United States will only be halving, not removing, tariffs.
Lobsters have been a big concern for Trump, who threatened in June to impose tariffs on Europe and China over lobster duties.
Lawmakers from Maine have repeatedly called for aid for the lobster industry, which supports the livelihood of 4,500 state-licensed lobstermen and an additional 10,000 people.
U.S. Senator Angus King said the agreement would help level the playing field for U.S. producers whose European sales declined after a trade deal between Canada and the EU eliminated tariffs on Canadian lobsters. The U.S. industry has also been hurt by Chinese tariffs imposed in 2018 and the collapse of sales to restaurants during coronavirus-related lockdowns.
The agreement will still need approval from EU governments and the European Parliament. That could come within weeks.
Washington has subjected $7.5 billion of EU products, including Scottish whisky, French wine and European cheese, to tariffs because of a WTO case it won over EU subsidies given to planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR). 
It had threatened to increase them. However, it carried out only very modest changes last week, a move welcomed by the European Commission as a sign of Washington's willingness to work through a range of trade disputes with Brussels.
The WTO is expected to clear the way for European tariffs against U.S. products in a dispute over subsidies given to Boeing (N:BA) this autumn.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A congressional panel overseeing the implementation of some coronavirus aid programs urged the Federal Reserve and Treasury to take more risk with taxpayer dollars and increase outreach efforts to deliver more aid to small and medium-sized businesses struggling because of the pandemic.
The bulk of the panel's recommendations centered around the $600 billion Main Street Lending Program, which has seen modest use since launching in July, more than three months after it was announced.
Some 522 lenders had registered with the program as of Aug. 10, though only 160 publicized they were accepting Main Street loan applications from new customers. The Fed had purchased $472 million in Main Street loans as of Wednesday, more than double the amount from a week earlier.
Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren, whose regional bank runs the program, said during a hearing with the congressional panel earlier this month that he expects more banks and businesses will sign up if the economy worsens.
The congressional oversight panel suggested the Fed consider using more of its regional banks, not just the Boston Fed, to improve operation of the program and experiment with potential changes.
The panel also encouraged the Fed to look at other ways to make money available to a broader set of companies, for example through “asset-backed lending and second-lien lending” against hotels or other commercial real estate. That could potentially make the Fed a mortgagee to real estate investment trusts, private equity firms and other property investors.

The oversight committee plans to hold a panel in the coming weeks about the Municipal Liquidity Facility, which supports state and local governments. New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) became the second issuer to tap the Fed's municipal lending program this week when it sold $450.7 million of debt to the facility, which is administered by the New York Fed.

The plan, which includes tax incentives and bureaucratic simplifications, is meant to encourage multinationals from the United States and other countries to relocate their operations from Asia.
""We looking for more mega-investments like the one that arrived last year with Japanese fund SoftBank (which invested) in Rappi for more than $1 billion,"" Flavia Santoro, the head of trade organization ProColombia, said at a launch event.
Mega-investments are the term used by the government to refer to investments worth more than $280 million.
ProColombia has identified 536 businesses in North America, Asia, Europe and other parts of Latin America which could possibly relocate. Thirty-one have so far shown interest.
Foreign direct investment in Colombia contracted 21.9% to $4.67 billion between January and July, according to the country's central bank. The figure for the year is predicted to be well below the $14.6 billion in 2019.
""This is how to advance the relocation strategy of global companies to Colombia, taking advantage of the post-COVID moment when there are various organization who are looking at relocation scenarios, among other things to take advantage of a country like ours which has 16 free trade agreements,"" said Jose Manuel Restrepo, Colombia's commerce minister.

1/ POWELL TAKES (VIRTUAL) CENTRE STAGE 
A lot has been riding on the Fed in recent months: risk assets have surged on the back of its do-whatever-it-takes approach to propping up the economy with asset purchases and zero-bound rates during the pandemic crisis. 
Now a key challenge is how to spur inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell may give hints on Thursday on the opening day of the Jackson Hole conference, where he will discuss the central bank's monetary policy framework review. 
The review looks at how to revamp Fed tools to guide the economy. As part of that, investors have been anticipating details on possible changes to how it targets inflation. 
To guard against the possibility of higher prices ahead, investors have loaded up on assets like gold and TIPs. Still, while five-year five-year forwards - an inflation gauge - have been rising, the measure remains below the Fed’s 2% target.

Chinese banks are expected to show the scars of the pandemic and the domestic economic slowdown for the first time when they report half-yearly earnings, having bucked the Western banking sector's downward trend in the first quarter. 
The big five state banks, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) (CCB), and Bank of China (BoC), kick off earnings season on Aug. 28. 
The government has pressed banks into service: financial institutions have been told to sacrifice 1.5 trillion yuan ($217 billion) in profit this year to support companies by lowering lending rates and fees, and deferring loan payments. 
Beijing wants new loans and overall financing to top last year's while the banking regulator has asked lenders to raise loan-loss provisions and come up with realistic profit plans. That means profits won’t be growing, as the filings will show.-China keeps lending benchmark LPR steady for 4th straight month, in line with market –-China's banking sector expected to dispose $490 bln of bad loans in 2020 – Xinhua –

The dollar, slipping to more than two year lows in recent days, looks out of favour thanks to negative inflation-adjusted yields, weaker macro-economic data and tensions between Washington and Beijing. The downward move has fueled familiar talk about the dollar's decline as the world's reserve currency.
Investors are trying to gauge where next for the greenback. Intraday volatility has increased across the currency complex suggesting bearish positioning versus the dollar may be at extremes. 
And unlike July, when virtually all non-dollar currencies and precious metals gained on the dollar's 4% fall, August has been a mixed bag. The yen and the Aussie have struggled. Even gold's eye-watering rally is showing signs of exhaustion after hitting a record near $2,100 per ounce earlier this month. 
Throw in a U.S. Federal Reserve wary of pumping in more stimulus just yet, approaching U.S. elections and the greenback may find some fresh legs.

Betting on a recovery of so-called value (read cheap) stocks has become a popular mainstream call among sell-side analysts as investors scramble to assess which bits of the market the rally could lift next.
Value stocks generally lag in the first stages of a bounce-back but usually follow risk-on stocks upwards as the economic recovery unfolds. Now with hopes that a COVID-19 vaccine could be widely available in early 2021, overlooked undervalued stocks are becoming tempting targets for stock pickers. 
A rotation to value, targeting banks, autos and energy value stocks has already made tentative runs, but the decade long underperformance of that segment of the market means many won't touch them with a barge pole.
Looking at the outstanding performance of value stocks and big tech since the great financial crisis in general - and the COVID-19 market in particular - investors are wary of the value-trap.

Belarus's political crisis rumble on, dragging the European Union and the United States into another proxy standoff with Russia, the country's main economic ally.
Street protests over alleged vote rigging in President Alexander Lukashenko’s 'landslide' election win are set to continue in Minsk. With Lukashenko refusing to re-run the vote and starting a criminal case against the opposition, it's not obvious how the tensions get resolved.
For Moscow, Belarus is an important strategic buffer against NATO and the EU and Russia sells the country oil at below-market prices. But the relationship is testy and even Russia's currency and bonds might now be affected by the situation, especially if sanctions come into play.
Meanwhile the hospitalisation of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, the biggest thorn in the Kremlin's side, will do little to shift unwanted attention away from Moscow, with Navalny's allies alleging poisoning.

Stocks are set to open mostly flat, and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) get busy on vaccine trials. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, August 21st.
1. Biden seeks to take American out of 'darkness'
Joe Biden wrapped up the Democratic National Convention with an acceptance speech that promised to lead the U.S. out of ‘darkness’, without mentioning President Donald Trump by name once.
""Character is on the ballot, compassion is on the ballot, decency, science, democracy. They're all on the ballot,"" Biden said.
Responding via Twitter, Trump said that Biden’s words were at odds with his 47-year record in politics. Opinion polls this week have shown Trump slightly narrowing Biden’s lead to around 8 percentage points.
2. Europe stumbles after new wave of infections
Europe’s economic recovery stuttered this month as renewed restrictions on travel disrupted plans to allow a meaningful summer tourism season.
Activity slowed for the first time in three months, according to a preliminary reading of the composite purchasing managers index compiled by consultancy IHS Markit. The PMI for the euro zone fell to 51.6 from 54.9, due largely to the services sector.
German manufacturing, the traditional engine of regional growth, held up better, the PMI rising to 53.0 from 51.0.
On Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel had said there would be no return to generalized lockdowns due to Covid-19.
3. U.K.'s recovery on track - but borrowing soars
There was better news across the English Channel. In the U.K., the composite PMI recovered to over 60, signifying a more vigorous rebound – albeit from a lockdown that was later and more severe in the euro zone.
July’s retail sales numbers, too, also came in better than expected, rising 3.6% on the month and 1.4% on the year. They’re now ahead of pre-pandemic levels for the first time. The government also borrowed less than analysts expected in July, although the headlines were grabbed by the fact that national debt topped 2 trillion pounds ($2.6 trillion) for the first time.
The pound rose against the euro but inched off seven-month highs against the dollar, shrugging off the predictable end of another inconclusive round of Brexit trade talks with the EU.
4. Stocks set to open mixed; Ride-hailers in focus
U.S. stocks are set to open largely flat, with little on the calendar to push them in either direction.
By 6:40 AM ET (1040 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 27 points or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was also down 0.1% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down by less than 0.1%.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), which defied gloomy expectations to post a quarterly profit after the bell on Thursday. Farming machinery maker Deere (NYSE:DE) and retailer  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) report before the open. 
 Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Uber (NYSE:UBER) may share the spotlight, after winning a stay on the California court ruling that would force them to reclassify drivers as employees.

5. Pfizer eyes October review for Covid-19 drug
Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech said they are on track to submit their experimental Covid-19 treatment for review by regulators as early as October, after publishing fresh data from an early-stage study.
The two companies said their vaccine was administered largely without side effects, although they noted mild to moderate fever in less than 20% of participants in the test.
Elsewhere, Johnson & Johnson said it planned to test its experimental Covid-19 drug on 60,000 people in a phase 3 trial in September.

1007,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>",British public debt tops 2 trillion pounds for first time,"By William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's public debt has surpassed 2 trillion pounds ($2.65 trillion) for the first time, underscoring the challenge for finance minister Rishi Sunak, who is under pressure to give even more emergency support for the pandemic-hit economy.
Net debt in July, excluding public banks, rose to 2.004 trillion pounds. That's equivalent to 100.5% of Britain's economic output, the highest since 1961 when the country was still struggling with the costs of fighting World War Two.
The debt surge reflects a huge increase in government spending, ranging from its massive coronavirus job subsidy scheme and tax cuts to discounts for restaurant diners, as well the hit to tax revenues from a nationwide lockdown.
Debt has leapt by about 200 billion pounds since the coronavirus crisis engulfed Britain.
Sunak said the crisis had put the public finances under significant strain, but without the government's huge spending spree things would have been far worse.
""Today’s figures are a stark reminder that we must return our public finances to a sustainable footing over time, which will require taking difficult decisions,"" he said.
""It is also why we are taking action now to support the growth and jobs which pay for our public services.""
Britain's budget forecasters warned last month that debt would pass the 2 trillion-pound mark this year before continuing its sharp rise to 2.5 trillion pounds in the 2022/23 financial year and to 2.6 trillion pounds by the mid-2020s.
Sunak is due to announce his latest plans for the economy in an annual budget speech in the autumn when unemployment is expected to be rising sharply.
His job protection scheme, which has so far cost 35 billion pounds, is due to expire at the end of October and he is facing calls from unions, the opposition Labour Party and many business leaders to come up with alternative forms of support.
""The priority for the Chancellor (finance minister) going forward should be to prioritise limiting the depth of the economic crisis, particularly given record low borrowing costs and the risk of a post-furloughing rise in unemployment,"" Charlie McCurdy, an economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said.
Britain's borrowing costs were little changed after Friday's data.
""Only once the recovery is secured should the Chancellor turn to tackling the deficit, with tax rises needing to be a key plank of that plan,"" McCurdy said.
Borrowing in the April-July period surged to 150.5 billion pounds, almost three times borrowing by the government during the previous financial year as a whole.
In July alone, borrowing was 26.7 billion pounds, the smallest since the lockdown began and the figure for June was revised down by 6 billion pounds.
But the Office for National Statistics said it had revised up its estimate for the deficit in the 2019/20 financial year to 56.6 billion pounds, leaving it nearly 8 billion pounds higher than originally thought.

As well as the surge in spending and lower tax revenues, debt as a share of gross domestic product has also been pushed up by the sharp contraction in the size of Britain's economy during the coronavirus lockdown.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>",Column: Can euro junk bonds stay so zen? - Mike Dolan,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - Summer offered relief from the pandemic shock in the more stressed part of Europe's corporate bond markets - but investors may be back on the frontline if a vaccine is slow to arrive.
The bonds of high-quality, investment-grade companies have effectively been given a free pass through the pandemic by their inclusion in massive central bank bond-buying campaigns deliberately designed to keep credit flowing.
As a result, that market has been a sweet-spot for many defensive investors looking for some positive income compared with often negative government bond yields - but with virtually the same level of official support.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s analysts insist ""investment-grade spreads are now a policy tool, and not a market"". Indices of high-grade euro corporate bonds are back to where they started the year, with paltry implied yields of little over 0.30%.
The riskier part of Europe's bond market, the high-yield ""junk bond"" market is a different kettle of fish - full of companies far more stressed by this year's sudden stop in the world economy and often outside the direct central bank support.
And yet, calm has resumed there too as many of these ""speculative"" bond names also benefit from a variety of other government backstops and credit guarantees.
And with banks awash with cash - so much so that already negative euro interbank lending rates have fallen below even the ECB's overnight lending rate over the past month - the position of financials both as lenders and also constituents of junk indices is significant in that recaptured market tranquility.
Although yields on the ICE (NYSE:ICE) Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) euro high-yield index trebled by March 20, to levels around 7.75% not seen since the height of the euro zone debt crisis in 2012, they have almost halved again since as insolvencies actually dropped across Europe and initial scramble to raise new debt ebbed to a trickle.
So, despite the leftfield onset of one of the deepest recessions in modern history, euro junk bond borrowers are only paying on average about 1.4 percentage points more than they were at the start of the year. That's almost a third less than the peak of the euro crisis in 2011 and nowhere near the blinding 25% during the Great Financial Crisis 12 years ago.

'MIND-BENDING'
According to the latest fund survey from Bank of America, 67% of high-yield investors think central bank and government supports were enough to contain the default cycle in Europe. A fifth felt the relative quality of the European high-yield market, where BB-rated names make up 70% of indices, and a lower share of hard-hit energy firms compared to U.S. counterparts were also key in getting default rates as low as 1.7% in July.
But citing what they called one of the most ""mind-bending"" statistics of an already strange year, BofA's credit team point out that credit guarantee schemes saw year-on-year insolvency rates plummet in Europe during the second quarter - down 13%, 25% and 60% for Germany, France and Spain respectively.
However, Europe may face its own version of the much-touted ""fiscal cliff"" stateside as many of these guarantee schemes expire by the end of this year, and it's far from clear yet whether they'll get rolled over or when a vaccine will arrive.
Mindful of that, credit-rating agency S&P Global warned this week that default rates in high-yield euro corporate bonds could spike again to 8.5% by June next year - meaning some 62 companies defaulting - and said the pandemic wrought ""arguably the most pronounced deterioration in credit quality ever"".
Sectors hit by social-distancing measures, such as retail, consumer products, transport and leisure, comprise 39% of outstanding European speculative debt. A further 6% from energy and mining have been whacked by the commodity price swoon.
""Expansive monetary and fiscal support could lessen defaults over the medium term, but with basic revenues flagging, the proportion of CCC/C issuers has risen sharply,"" it said.
""When combined with continued support, this could lead to drawn-out period of a higher-than-average default rate, rather than typical cyclical behaviour.""
Yet a 8.5% default rate would still be less than the financial crisis peak of 10% in 2009, and almost half the record peaks of 2002 after the dotcom bust. What's more, not one of the respondents in BofA's recent fund manager survey saw default rates exceed 15% in this cycle.
""Bond investors have been pragmatic instead of being rational,"" said Unigestion's Florian Ielpo, adding they have simply bought up assets most buoyed by central-bank liquidity moves and government supports. ""The impact of these dislocations will last as long as policymakers have the upper hand – i.e. for a long time.""

1009,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 01:30AM ET</span>",South Africa's economy to grow strongly this quarter after record second-quarter fall: Reuters poll,"By Vuyani Ndaba
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's already recession-hit economy likely suffered its deepest-ever contraction in the second quarter but is set to grow strongly in the third as curbs to contain the coronavirus pandemic ease, a Reuters poll found.
Economists lowered their forecasts again and now expect an annualised 44.5% contraction in the April-June quarter, compared with the median estimate in a July poll for a 38.7% fall.
That would be by far the biggest drop since comparable records began in 1993, the year before South Africa held its first fully democratic elections. Second quarter GDP data is due early next month.
The most pessimistic forecast was for a 53% contraction while even the most optimistic predicted 20% shrinkage.
Growth is seen recovering in the third quarter, although the forecast 18.6% rebound is not as sharp as the 19.3% predicted last month.
JP Morgan wrote that high-frequency data point to a notable recovery of activity in July and August.
However, that will not be enough to offset the previous plunge as coronavirus restrictions closed down swathes of the economy.
The 2020 median outlook for an 8.0% contraction is unchanged from last month's poll but next year's rebound has been cut to 3.1% from 3.5%.
""There is higher forecast risk when modelling the sectors for which monthly data is lacking,"" Citi economist Gina Schoeman wrote. ""We are confident that the agricultural sector will be a lone positive print given that it remained open throughout with fairly good harvests, but this is a small weight in GDP.""

With the outlook bleak, the South African Reserve Bank is seen keeping interest rates at their current level of 3.50% for much longer than previously thought.
The median of the latest survey suggests no change though 2021 whereas the previous poll pointed to a 25 basis point hike in January or March.
Inflation is expected to remain benign - below the midpoint of the Reserve Bank's 3-6% comfort level - at an average of 3.1% this year and 4.0% next year.
SARB Governor Lesetja Kganyago said last week that adding unemployment or economic growth to the Bank's mandate, an additional measure touted by some politicians and labour leaders, would risk policy mistakes and hurting its credibility.

1010,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 08:15PM ET</span>",U.S. economic recovery outlook steady even as Wall St touches record: Reuters Poll,"By Shrutee Sarkar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is recovering smartly from the deepest recession on record, but unlike financial markets, economic forecasters have yet to show any new wave of optimism about quelling the virus and business returning to normal.
Indeed, the latest Reuters poll suggests that if the world's largest economy is to sustain its momentum, a second round of fiscal stimulus ahead of the upcoming presidential election to preserve jobs would be required. 
The survey of over 110 economists taken Aug. 14-20 found the U.S. economy - which remains the global epicenter of the virus with over 5.5 million cases - would grow 18.8% this quarter on an annualized basis after shrinking a record 32.9% last quarter.
It was then expected to grow 6.1% in Q4, slightly slower than the 6.5% rate predicted in July. That is a bit stronger than the best quarter during the recovery from recession following the global financial crisis over a decade ago.
While the poll median for Q3 was the most optimistic since April, the Q4 consensus was cut for the third consecutive survey and there was no material change in the growth outlook next year, with growth seen slowing from 5.0% in the first quarter to 3.0% by Q4. 
""With consumer confidence weakening, employment growth stalling and incomes being squeezed by lower federal unemployment benefits, there is the potential for a period of weaker economic activity in the absence of more support,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York.
""There is still huge uncertainty about a vaccine and its efficacy. Given the economic challenges already mentioned we suspect that the recovery could take longer than many anticipate.""
The latest findings stand in sharp contrast to exuberance on Wall Street, where benchmark stock indexes have recovered all of the 35% losses incurred at the start of the pandemic and are trading just below record highs. 
The Federal Reserve has pledged unlimited liquidity through its bond purchases after slashing interest rates to zero, the biggest such stimulus in history, while the U.S. Congress enacted a $2 trillion fiscal package earlier this year.
In minutes to its latest meeting, the Fed suggested more support for the economy would be required.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told Reuters this week Wall Street has called this ""about right"" so far and the United States would do better than many forecasters anticipate.
But Reuters polls accurately estimated the historic collapse in Q2 GDP, predicting a 30% contraction as early as April and came within 1.2 percentage points of the actual -32.9% outcome the week before the data was published late last month. 
The latest median 2020 GDP forecast showed a contraction of 5.3%, compared to -5.6% predicted last month. But the growth outlook for 2021 was cut to 3.8% from 4.0%. 
Asked how long would it take for the U.S. economy to reach its pre-COVID-19 level, more than half of respondents, or 28 of 48, said two or more years. The rest said one to two years and none said less than a year.
Such strong rates of growth are not forecast to generate much price pressure either, with inflation expected to bump around below 2% this year and next.
Much will depend in the near-term on whether Congress, deadlocked along party lines, comes to an agreement. 
""Delinquencies will likely rise even further if some sort of deal cannot be worked out to extend supplemental unemployment benefits. Failure to reach a deal on more stimulus would have wide ranging impact on the economy,"" said Sam Bullard, senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC). 
The jobs outlook is uncertain. Economists were almost split on the risk the job recovery reverses by year-end, with 24 saying it was high or very high and 20 saying it was low.
The unemployment rate was forecast to slip over the next two years, but would remain above pre-COVID levels, averaging 9.0% this year and 7.6% next year, compared with 3.5% reported just before the pandemic.

1011,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 07:45PM ET</span>",House Speaker Pelosi says she opposes smaller coronavirus relief bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday that now was not the time for the chamber to pass a stripped-down coronavirus relief bill, after more than 100 House Democrats urged their leadership to pass enhanced unemployment benefits.
""I don't think strategically it's where we should go right now because the Republicans would like to pass something like that and say forget about"" other Democratic priorities, Pelosi said in an interview on PBS's ""NewsHour"" program.
Pelosi said she would also want any legislation to include aid for state and local governments, food aid for children, funding for vote-by-mail and other initiatives.
On Tuesday, more than 100 Democrats in the House of Representatives issued a letter urging Pelosi to allow a vote on a bill to reinstate the lapsed $600 a week unemployment benefits until the coronavirus pandemic ends.

Asked about the letter, Pelosi said: ""I don't think the timing is for us to do it right now.""

1012,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 07:09PM ET</span>",China’s Covid Recovery Is Taking on Water,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- One of the most severe floods in decades is ravaging the industrial heartland, just as China struggles to shake off the impact of Covid-19. The Yangtze River’s inundation has so far caused direct economic losses of 178.9 billion yuan ($25.7 billion), including collapsed buildings, flooded factory floors and homes and livelihoods lost for millions of people. Average rainfall for June and July surpassed previous years; fixing the damage has barely begun.
The latest disaster feeds into a picture of an uneven turnaround as China picks itself up from the pandemic. Beijing has pumped in trillions of yuan in stimulus and relief, and there are signs of upticks in activity. But it’s getting harder to say what the true state of the Chinese economy is. The numbers are all over the place. For investors buying into a cyclical rebound, it may be worth a deeper look.
Parsing through more granular data shows that heavy trucks are selling like hotcakes – up 89% last month from a year earlier. Excavator sales rose almost 30%. Demand for automation machinery has picked up, as has movement of goods across the country. Machine use hours fell 3% overall, and were flat in flood-stricken southern China. Monthly electricity generation is down, and cement inventory levels are higher than in previous years. Government spending on fixed assets is rising strongly, but industrial production and manufacturing investment are sagging.
Much of the enthusiasm for China rides on expectation alone. Hopes that Beijing will spend, ease and build its way out out of the slowdown are pushing up proxies of economic activity.  Two trillion yuan ($288 billion) of additional funds, including special direct transfers of over 1.5 trillion yuan, have been committed.  That’s in addition to funds that were deployed previously, including the issuance of special bonds. Yet, the reality is turning out to be harder. The floods haven’t just caused consumer prices to tick up, they’ve slowed the ability to build and manufacture – regardless of money promised toward infrastructure, roads and railways. Will buying trucks now force repair activity to restart in the second half of 2020? Unlikely. The pain will be lasting.
All this points to the recovery starting to lose steam. Though China was first in and (sort of) first out of Covid-19, consumers aren’t jumping on the bandwagon. Part of the problem is that the outbreak came on top of already sagging demand that Beijing was struggling to revive. Manufacturers and industrial firms were facing a crisis of confidence, balance sheets were constrained and a boost to direct financing wasn’t trickling through.
Now, the floods have come. Sure, the meiyu front is a seasonal affair. In certain years, like 1998 and 2016, the rains turn severe. To deal with this, China has built 98,000 reservoirs, 110,000 hydrological stations and a web of hundreds of thousands of levees. Climate change has made the deluges worse. A study on the impact of floods on the manufacturing sector over the seven years to 2010 found that firms’ output, on average, decreased by 28.3% in years of large-scale inundations, or a total of 15.4 trillion yuan loss to the economy. The study also found there was a lagged effect: In the two years following such disasters, a further 2.3% was lost, indicating the impact lingers and is larger than just the direct damage. Bringing these lessons forward to now, while freight volumes may be rising, people aren’t traveling by rail and air in droves. Returning to work has become much more challenging, especially for factory and migrant workers traversing the country.
The crises of 2020, worse than any single natural disaster, confront Beijing with a dilemma. On one hand, old-school fiscal pumping and railways to nowhere will boost short-term growth. So, domestic construction machinery manufacturers like Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic Co. forecast production of certain excavator parts to rise by 30% this month from a year earlier, sending its stock price up over 80% this year. On the other, the top brass knows that investments in high-tech infrastructure will pay off in coming years, helping fuel the current stock market rally. The uneven turnaround stems from unclear priorities: growth, debt, or the future economy? The numbers show as much.
Underlying it all is a teetering banking system with clogged plumbing. Despite the monetary easing, direct financing is handicapped at a time the economy needs it most. State planners have tried to strike a balance. But they’ve failed to show an appetite for the pain required to let some weaker companies fail and allow real demand to emerge. Only when they demonstrate real priorities to investors can China get this recovery back above water.

“We will give tax credits to companies to bring jobs back to America, and if they don’t do it, we will put tariffs on those companies, and they will have to pay us a lot of money,” Trump said during a campaign event in Pennsylvania.
“So what are they going to do? They are going to bring the jobs back,” Trump said.
He offered no explanation about how such a system of tax credits and tariffs would work, and it wasn’t immediately clear if the White House is developing such a policy. The remarks came during a more than hour-long speech intended to rebut former Vice President Joe Biden’s acceptance of the Democratic nomination for president later Thursday.
Biden was born in Scranton, near the borough of Old Forge where Trump spoke.

1014,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 05:00PM ET</span>",Former Fed staffers urge U.S. Senate to reject Shelton nomination,"By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - A group of former Federal Reserve staffers, including economists, lawyers and bank presidents, sent a letter to U.S. senators Thursday asking them to reject the nomination of Judy Shelton, one of President Donald Trump’s picks for the Federal Reserve Board.
The Fed alumni said Shelton, who has advocated for a return to the gold standard and questioned the need for the central bank, has ""a decades-long record of writings and statements that call into question her fitness for a spot on the Fed's Board of Governors."" The letter was signed by 38 former Fed staffers, including two former Fed bank presidents.
""The Fed has serious work ahead of it,"" the former Fed staffers wrote https://medium.com/@fedalumni/fed-alumni-urge-senate-rejection-of-fed-nominee-shelton-c4785101e346. ""While we applaud the Board having a diversity of viewpoints represented at its table, Ms. Shelton's views are so extreme and ill-considered as to be an unnecessary distraction from the tasks at hand.""
The Senate Banking Committee confirmed Shelton's nomination last month with a 13-12 party-line vote, despite a rocky confirmation hearing in mid-February, when several senators expressed concerns about placing the longtime Fed critic in a role that would give her a say on U.S. monetary policy.
Shelton's nomination must now be approved by the full Senate, where the deciding votes may come from a handful of moderate Republicans. At least four Republicans would need to vote against Shelton to sink the nomination.
U.S. Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Senator Mitt Romney of Utah have both said they would vote against Shelton's nomination. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said in late July that he would ""study carefully the records"" for Shelton and Christopher Waller, Trump's other nominee to the Fed board, after the Senate finishes working on virus legislation.

Chinese crude buyers have chartered about 19 tankers for September to send roughly 37 million barrels of oil to China, according to provisional tanker fixtures. If these proceed as planned, the exports would surpass a record set in May at 35.2 million barrels, according to U.S. Census data compiled by Bloomberg. The May volume was also the most by any U.S. oil buyer for a given month, data show.
Under phase one of the deal, the world’s largest oil importer promised to buy an additional $200 billion of U.S. goods and services in 2020 and 2021, including $52 billion in energy products, in an agreement signed in January. Purchases so far have lagged that target. A review of the deal that was set for for August 15 was canceled, and has yet to be rescheduled.
All but one of the tankers, which can carry about 2 million barrels each, will originate on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Unipec, the trading arm of Chinese’s largest refiners Sinopec (NYSE:SHI), has booked some of those tankers, while a few others were chartered by PetroChina Co Ltd, a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corp.
Still, fixtures can get canceled or rerouted if market fundamentals change.

1017,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 03:40PM ET</span>",Fed Chair Powell to speak on Fed's framework review next Thursday,"By Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell could deliver a sneak peak into the U.S. central bank's efforts to revamp its approach to monetary policy next Thursday when he addresses the Kansas City Fed's annual central banking conference. 
Powell will discuss the Fed's monetary policy framework review at 9:10 EDT (1310 GMT) on the opening day of the conference, the Fed said on Thursday. 
It will be Powell's first public appearance since the central bank's policy meeting in late July, when the Fed reiterated its commitment to use all its tools to support an economy whose outlook is very much dependent on the course of the novel coronavirus. 
Investors have been eagerly awaiting details on possible changes to how the Fed targets inflation that, in the current environment, could mean the Fed sticks with aggressive stimulus measures longer than under its previous rubric. 
Minutes of the Fed's July meeting, released on Wednesday, showed policymakers are nearing agreement on refinements to the Fed's framework, though they did not provide any detail. 
U.S. central bank chiefs have in the past used the annual gathering, usually convened in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to signal important policy shifts. 
This year the conference, entitled ""Navigating the Decade Ahead: Implications for Monetary Policy,"" will take place in a virtual and public format because of the coronavirus pandemic, giving the chair an even bigger megaphone than usual.
Fed policymakers have been working on a new framework since late 2018. Low inflation and low interest rates globally, they worried, would make combating future recessions using their existing strategies more difficult. 
When the pandemic sent the world's biggest economy into its sharpest downturn since the 1930s, the Fed went big, slashing rates to zero and buying trillions of dollars of bonds to boost investment and hiring. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 10.2% and the virus continuing to spread, some Fed policymakers are advocating even more stimulus. 

Any changes to the Fed's overarching framework may have little short-term impact on Fed policy, but could signal a readiness to take even more aggressive action ahead.

""In total, as at the end of the first week of August, banks had provided voluntary relief on loans with a book value at risk of R537 billion,"" it said.
South African Finance Minister Tito Mboweni held a meeting with bank chief executives on Wednesday.
Banks in South Africa are seeing one of their worst crises in ages with rising bad loans and hefty impairment charges in an economy which was already in recession before the pandemic. The country's bank index <.JBANK> is currently trading at a discount of almost 40% to the country's top 40 index (JTOPI).
However, fund managers have said the banks have requisite balance sheet strength, management depth and strong profitability to weather the storm.
Besides temporary loan relief, the banks have disbursed 14% of the 100 billion rand loan guarantee scheme announced by the government in May, according to the statement.
To Aug. 1., the scheme has disbursed around 14 billion rand out of the 100 billion rand on offer, benefiting almost 10,000 businesses and 15,000 applications still under process, it said.
The loan guarantee scheme, with a total outlay of 200 billion rand, is part of a 500 billion rand package announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa to cushion the impact of coronavirus on South African businesses and individuals.
However, disbursals have still been low as companies are wary of piling up debt and hence changes in the scheme are being worked out, the statement said.

“Ms. Shelton’s views are so extreme and ill-considered as to be an unnecessary distraction from the tasks at hand,” the letter said.
The letter was also signed by two former reserve bank presidents and three former division directors on the board’s staff. It has 38 current signatories, all of whom worked at the central bank at some point.
The Senate Banking Committee advanced Shelton’s nomination on a party-line vote in July, and she now awaits approval by the full Senate. No vote has been scheduled for her or fellow nominee Christopher Waller, research director at the St. Louis Fed.
Shelton didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
Two Republican senators, Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine, have said they will vote against Shelton, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska has said she was undecided, making Shelton’s fate uncertain. Her confirmation would be blocked if four Republicans vote against her and Democrats remain unified in their opposition.
Shelton, an informal adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign, has drawn significant criticism for policy views well outside the mainstream -- including a history of admiration for the gold standard -- and for being a political loyalist who might bend to Trump’s will.
She appeared to abandon her advocacy for ultra-tight monetary policy when she emerged as a Fed candidate, publicly aligning herself with the president’s calls for lower interest rates.
The letter assailed her past advocacy for the gold standard, her one-time opposition to federal deposit insurance and past remarks calling into question the need for a central bank.
“Ms. Shelton has a decades-long record of writings and statements that call into question her fitness for a spot on the Fed’s Board of Governors,” the letter said. “Now, she appears to have jettisoned all of these positions to argue for subordination of the Fed’s policies to the White House -- at least as long as the White House is occupied by a president who agrees with her political views.”
Other prominent signatories to the letter included Cathy Minehan, former president of the Boston Fed; Gary Stern, former president of the Minneapolis Fed; Edwin Truman, former director of the division of international finance; and William English, former director of the division of monetary affairs.

1021,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 01:30PM ET</span>",New laws herald crackdown on Chile´s delinquent 'daddies of the heart',"By Natalia A. Ramos Miranda
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The release of 10% of Chilean citizens’ pension funds early to help withstand the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic has sparked an unexpected flurry of legal petitions for child support from the country’s army of indebted “baby daddies.”
Half a million petitions have been lodged for child support payments to be made by the four out of five absent parents - largely fathers – who are in default, according to the Ministry of Justice and prosecution service figures.
Pedro Maldonado, head of one of Santiago’s four family courts, said the avalanche of cases highlighted a problem in need of a solution. 
""People think that child support is not an imperative like a bank loan,"" he told reporters. ""The large number of debtors are men because it remains the case that it falls on women to take care of their children.""
The issue of absent fathers is far from new in Chile, where they even have a nickname: ""Papitas de Corazon,"" or ""Daddies of the Heart."" 
Figures from Chile’s National Institute of Statistics show 42% of households are headed by a woman, above the regional 35% average estimated by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.
Despite Chile being advanced regionally terms in making child support obligatory, latency has become the norm. 
""It is one of the greatest moral dramas there is in this country,"" Carmen Dominguez, director of the Family Centre at Santiago’s Catholic University, told Reuters.
""Thousands of children have grown up with fathers who just could not care less. It is a completely naturalized reality."" 
TIP OF THE ICEBERG 
Under Chilean law, child support is at the bottom of the debt hierarchy and attracts no automatic interest or adjustments, meaning people are more likely to stop paying it than another debt like a mortgage, said Dominguez.
The issue burst into the public domain this month after irate single mothers saw an opportunity with the release of $9.654 billion so far to 7.2 million people from the country’s private pension funds after a law proposing it swept through Congress and onto the statute books on July 24. 
Since then, the prosecution service, which is responsible for mediating child support agreements between separated couples, has received 500,000 petitions relating to 300,000 old and new cases of child support debts in the hope they can be settled using the pension payouts, which average $1,350. 
Dominguez said those who came forward to seek payments were ""the tip of the iceberg,"" with many mothers simply accepting they had to shoulder the childcare burden alone. 
Among those seeking the pension payout of her former partner is Daneri Plaza, 40, who has been trying to obtain overdue alimony from her daughter`s father since 2005. 
Over the years, the judiciary has attempted to help her claw back an estimated $11,250 of support owed using measures that included an attempt to arrest the father. But he was never home during the attempts and has not held a steady job for his earnings to be tapped. 
Plaza´s daughter is now 20 and studying. Given the uncertain future of Chile´s students amid persistent lockdowns and weak job market, she could still use the money, her mother said.
""My daughter has the right to receive contributions from her father,"" Plaza told Reuters.
GUARANTOR STATE 
Chile’s Congress, invigorated by the widespread positive reception of the pensions bill, has passed more legislation in record time in recent weeks, including one last Wednesday to allow the pensions funds of parents who owe child support to be redirected to their children instead.
A move is also afoot to add defaulting fathers to the National Debt Registry. 
However, with Chile`s unemployment rate at 11 percent and the economy projected by the Central Bank to contract between 5.5% and 7.5% in 2020, there are warnings that latent child support will only get worse if the government does not implement extensive reform.
Patricia Nuñez, early child development officer for Unicef in Chile, said the move to seize released pensions was a good first step.

She added: ""The problem is that this ends up being treated as an individual situation, between private parties, but we must open the discussion on the role of the state as guarantor.""

(Reuters) - Americans made tentative moves back to restaurants and gyms over the past week, hiring advanced across a sample of industries and a rise in job postings suggested it may continue, signs the U.S. recovery grinds along, albeit not without some setbacks.
High-frequency data estimating retail stores visits and employment across industries as well as broader indexes of the recovery, after largely plateauing during a summertime surge in coronavirus cases, mostly moved higher through early and mid-August.

Defying worries, at least so far, that the expiration of extra unemployment insurance benefits in July would lead to an immediate collapse of spending, August opened ""on the right foot,"" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Gregory Daco wrote after the company's recovery index jumped 1.3 percentage points for the week ended Aug. 7.
Graphic - Oxford Economics Recovery Index: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/OXFORDINDEX/rlgpdlnyepo/chart.png
The June and July rise in daily diagnosed coronavirus cases moderated, improving the index's health component. After topping 66,000 last month, the 7-day moving average of new cases has fallen back below 50,000 according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. Measures of mobility, demand, production and employment all rose as well, and the improved health data ""if sustained, will bolster the other dimensions in coming weeks,"" Daco wrote.
That remains an ""if"" as the fall reopening of schools and colleges poses new challenges - of containing the virus where classes and activities are conducted in person, or of finding ways for parents to leave the home if needed for work in cases where they are not. Colleges including the University of Notre Dame and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill have already reversed plans to reopen and moved to online instruction after virus breakouts among returning students.
Nor is all the data positive. Initial claims for unemployment insurance rose unexpectedly to 1.1 million for the week ending Aug. 15. They had fallen below 1 million the week before for the first time since March, raising hopes of a faster decline in joblessness.
Ongoing claims by contrast continued a steady decline to 14.8 million as furloughed workers moved back into jobs, and other employment data showed company hiring plans at least staying steady.
Weekly new job openings aggregated by Chmura Economics from companies and national job sites rose through early August, an indicator of company intentions to bring on new workers. An index compiled by job website Indeed comparing current openings to 2019 has continued rising though at a slower pace in August.
Graphic - Job openings tick up: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/REOPENING/ygdvzmymzpw/chart.png
Data from time management firm Kronos showed shifts across industries rose 1.4% over the week ending Aug. 16, with about half the hiring attributed to the return of workers to schools and colleges. 
Retail spending also appeared to hold up. Data published by reservation site Opentable on seated diners at restaurants was at or better than 50% of the year-ago level Friday through Sunday, the first such three-day stretch since mid-March and a stark contrast to the full collapse of restaurant dining in April.
Data on retail foot traffic from cellphone tracking firm Unacast showed visits to restaurants last weekend hit 2019 levels in about half of states for the first time since late July, with a similar return to beauty salons and barbershops. Traffic to gyms hit year-ago levels in 17 states, the most since mid-July.
Measures of retail traffic compiled by Safegraph, by contrast, fell about a percentage point, and the number of employees fell slightly at a sample of small businesses, according to data provided by employee time management firm Homebase.
Yet people are spending. Credit and debit card purchases by 30 million Chase cardholders reached a pandemic-era peak in the week ending Aug. 14, falling just 9% short of its year-ago level.
JP Morgan economist Jesse Edgerton cautioned that while the data showed little impact from the lapse in unemployment benefits in July, those effects could be masked by the fact that the benefits are often paid through separate state-issued debit cards not included in his analysis, or because those on unemployment may be underrepresented among Chase cardholders.
Nevertheless, he wrote, combined with other data on restaurant dining, overall mobility and other indicators of spending, ""we have thus far seen little sign of decline...since the extra benefits expired,"" with a JP Morgan jobs tracker predicting gains of 1.2 million in August.

1023,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 12:30PM ET</span>",Factbox: High-frequency data sources for tracking the U.S. pandemic economy,"(Reuters) - Policymakers, economists and investors are turning increasingly to so-called high-frequency data to get a more timely snapshot of the U.S. economy during the fast-moving coronavirus pandemic than traditional monthly and quarterly indicators can provide.
These run the gamut from long-established government reports such as the Labor Department's weekly unemployment benefits figures - which in the latest week shot back above 1 million new claims - to new privately sourced analyses of retail foot traffic from mobile phone tracking data and shifts worked at small businesses derived from payroll service providers.
Here are some of the sources:
* The U.S. Department of Labor's Weekly Jobless Claims https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/claims.asp report, published every Thursday morning, has long been viewed as the most timely official data on the state of U.S. employment.
* Alternative views on what's happening with employment are available from time management firms Homebase https://joinhomebase.com/data and Kronos https://www.kronos.com/about-us/newsroom/update-us-workforce-activity, which shed light on information such as the number of workers on the job and numbers of shifts worked.
* JobsEQ by Chmura http://www.chmuraecon.com/blog aggregates new job listings posted each week by companies and on job websites, considered an advance indicator of future job growth.
* Mobility reports from Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility and Apple https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility Inc (O:AAPL) show how much people are moving around in different communities as lockdowns ease or are reimposed.
* Data analytics firms Unacast https://www.unacast.com/covid19/covid-19-retail-impact-scoreboard and Safegraph https://www.safegraph.com/dashboard/covid19-commerce-patterns offer even more granular information on foot traffic at retailers and other commercial destinations.
* Online restaurant reservation site Opentable https://www.opentable.com/state-of-industry tracks daily counts of seated diners and compares that to year-ago levels, a series many economists have followed to gauge activity in one of the hardest-hit industries.
* For keeping track of trends on travel, which has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) provides Checkpoint travel numbers https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput.
* A number of the 12 regional banks in the Federal Reserve system have devised activity indexes of their own. The New York Fed, for instance, uses 10 different data series ranging from weekly jobless claims to steel production to produce its own Weekly Economic Index https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/weekly-economic-index#.
* Opportunity Insights' Economic Tracker https://www.tracktherecovery.org, with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Brown University, combines anonymized data from private companies, including credit card processors and payroll firms, to provide a real-time picture of employment rates, consumer spending, and job postings across counties, industries, and income groups.
* A number of investment and economic research firms have formulated their own activity indexes. The Oxford Economics Recovery Tracker http://blog.oxfordeconomics.com/topic/recovery-tracker, for example, takes into account financial conditions and health metrics as well as indicators of employment and demand. 
* For insight on the spread of COVID-19 itself, Johns Hopkins University's Tracking Project https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map keeps tabs on daily U.S. county-level data on testing, population, infection rate, and hospital capacity.

* And the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Protect Public Data Hub https://protect-public.hhs.gov provides COVID-19 information from non-government datasets collected by academia, non-profit organizations, industry, hospitals, and facilities reporting from all 50 states and territories.

""First step to realise trade partnership is to conclude ongoing trade negotiations,"" said Taranjit Singh Sandhu during a virtual summit organised by an industry body.
India and the United States have been struggling for more than a year to conclude the limited trade deal, sparring over higher tariffs and New Delhi's policies on e-commerce and data storage.

1026,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 07:27AM ET</span>",Turkey Avoids Interest-Rate Hike ,"(Bloomberg) -- Turkey left its policy interest rates unchanged on Thursday, risking greater volatility in the lira as the central bank looks for a backdoor way of containing the currency’s weakness.
The Monetary Policy Committee held its key one-week repo rate at 8.25% for a third month, in line with the majority of forecasts in a Bloomberg survey. In the view of most analysts, however, pressure on the lira and the worsening inflation outlook warranted an outright rate hike.
The MPC said it will continue with its “liquidity measures,” according to a statement. The Turkish lira depreciated after the decision, reversing earlier gains against the dollar.
“The gradual normalization of pandemic-specific financial measures and recent tightening steps taken in liquidity management are judged to support macrofinancial stability,” it said. “However, depending on the course of the pandemic, uncertainties regarding domestic and external demand conditions remain significant.”
Policy makers led by Governor Murat Uysal haven’t stood pat but instead tightened liquidity by relying on fringe tools and ceasing to provide funding at its cheapest benchmark rate. News on Wednesday of a possible energy discovery in the Black Sea may have also emboldened the central bank as Turkish stocks and the currency rallied.
Uysal’s preferred path will likely be to continue tightening by stealth and avoiding a change in the benchmark that could irk President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The Turkish leader is a firm believer that high rates cause inflation. Most economists and central banks around the world believe the opposite to be true.
It’s a view Erdogan repeated this month even after the lira weakened to a record low. The currency is the third-worst performer in emerging markets this year with a loss of about 19% against the dollar.
The lira traded 0.9% weaker at 7.35 per dollar as of 2:20 p.m. in Istanbul, the biggest depreciation among the currencies of developing developing nations on Thursday. Yields on two-year local bonds added seven basis points to 13.33%.
“The resistance to hiking interest rates despite market forces suggesting otherwise shouldn’t come as a shock to anyone,” said Simon Harvey, a London-based market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd. “Whether this was the right decision by Governor Uysal, only time will tell.”
Bumpy Outlook
Investors anticipate the Turkish currency will remain among the world’s most unstable, with its three-month implied volatility the world’s second highest after Brazil’s real.
The central bank’s approach is now effectively to tweak the cost of funding on a daily basis, modifying the amount of liquidity available to lenders across its various rates. The average cost of cash provided by the central bank rose to 9.37% on Wednesday as a result, compared with as low as 7.34% in July.
It’s also conducted conventional repo auctions in which lenders set their own rates through bids, and limited the amount of money lenders can borrow in the interbank market, a move that may send some of them to seek funding at the regulator’s highest rate.
The monetary authority still has space for additional liquidity steps and could direct banks to borrow from its late liquidity window at 11.25%, Ibrahim Aksoy, chief economist and strategist of HSBC Asset Management Turkey, said before the decision.
Investors say the problem is that such an approach lacks transparency. What looks like tightening today can be reversed tomorrow with little notice or explanation.
It additionally amounts to a reversal of a decision under former Governor Murat Cetinkaya to focus on a single benchmark from June 2018 after a bout of lira depreciation resulted in a massive rate hike.
Prior to Thursday’s decision, Turkish policy makers delivered 1,575 basis points of rate cuts in nine consecutive steps before pausing for two months.
“They learned nothing from 2018, or it was just re-affirmed that Erdogan still runs monetary policy,” said Timothy Ash, a London-based strategist at BlueBay Asset Management. “We have seen the movie, got the t-shirt, eaten the popcorn.”

1027,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 06:34AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday, August 20th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. weekly jobless claims come round again, as the dollar bounces and stocks and commodities fall in response to the Federal Reserve's failure to offer any fresh monetary goodies. Airbnb's IPO is back on, and Vladimir Putin's most fearsome opponent is poisoned as the trouble in Belarus continues to bubble. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, August 20th.
1. Jobless claims due
Thursday means it’s time for the latest update on the health of the U.S. labor market. Initial jobless claims are expected to have fallen further last week to a new five-month low of 925,000, from 963,000 the week before.
Continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week time lag, are expected to fall by nearly half a million to 15.00 million.
However, while that would extend the positive trend, it only covers half the story. Last week’s data from the Labor Department showed 28 million Americans still claiming jobless benefits, when the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance scheme is included.
The Philadelphia Fed’s business survey will also be released at the same time.
2 Dollar bounces, commodities sell off as Fed disappoints
The dollar bounced and commodities slipped after the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s July policy meeting failed to give any clear hint of a shift to looser monetary policy. By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the dollar index was back above 93.000 and the EUR/USD was at $1.1836, over a cent below this week’s high.
Gold futures were down 1.7% at around $1,934 an ounce and U.S. crude oil futures were down 1.1% at $42.63 a barrel.
The Fed warned that government may have to increase stimulus efforts to keep the economic recovery on track – putting the spotlight back on a still-deadlocked Capitol Hill.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly is due to speak at 1 PM ET (1700 GMT), where those still hungry for hints of easier money may yet be satisfied.
3. Stocks set to open lower despite Nvidia's blowout quarter;
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower against a backdrop of disappointment over Fed policy, and the latest U.S. move against China. The administration said on Tuesday it will suspend reciprocal tax arrangements between the U.S. and Hong Kong in response to the effective ending of Hong Kong’s political autonomy.
By 6:30 AM ET, the Dow 30 futures contract was down 75 points, or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down less than 0.1%.
Stocks in focus Thursday are likely to include NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), which fell 1.4% in premarket despite the chipmaker posting record sales in the past three months, due largely to demand for gaming and remote services.
There are also updates due from Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba , as well as cosmetics group Estee Lauder and the controversial biotech startup Sorrento Therapeutics.
4. AirBnb files for IPO
The year’s biggest IPO is back on. Airbnb said it has filed confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering, rather than the direct listing that it had previously signalled it intended to pursue.
That means the company is likely to be selling new stock to strengthen its balance sheet, rather than just offering a cash-out for its early investors.
Airbnb was hit hard by the pandemic but its business has bounced back surprisingly quickly, with bookings up 6.7% on the year in July. However, when it sold debt earlier this year to shore up liquidity, the attached warrants converted into stock at a valuation of some $18 billion, barely half of the valuation in its last private funding round.
5. Russian opposition leader in suspected poisoning
Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was hospitalized and reported to be unconscious and in a critical condition after a suspected poisoning.
The news will grab the attention of domestic opponents of President Vladimir Putin at a time when the prospect of Russian intervention in Belarus, with the attendant political shockwaves through Europe, is appearing increasingly likely.  
Russian state media, having reported relatively cautiously on the violent crackdown following this month’s presidential elections, have now swung firmly behind President Alexander Lukashenko.
Russian stocks were the worst performers in Europe overnight, falling 2.2% to a 10-day low. The ruble fell to a two-week low against the dollar."

1029,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>","China, United States agree to hold trade talks, Chinese commerce ministry says","BEIJING (Reuters) - China and the United States have agreed to hold trade talks ""in the coming days"" to evaluate the progress of their Phase 1 trade deal six months after it took effect in February, the Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday. 
Ministry spokesman Gao Feng made the comments at a weekly briefing held online, but did not elaborate.
They followed Tuesday's remarks by White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows that no new high-level trade talks were scheduled, though both sides were in touch about implementing the Phase 1 deal.
The deal, reached on Jan. 15, and seen as a major breakthrough after a two-year long trade dispute between the world's two largest economies, set ambitious targets for China to sharply boost purchases of U.S. farm and manufactured goods. 
But ties quickly soured in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic and China's imposition of a new national security law in Hong Kong.
Both sides traded threats and sanctions on individuals and businesses, such as Chinese video platform TikTok.
Official data also suggests China's imports of U.S. farm and manufactured goods, energy and services are well behind the pace needed to meet a first-year target increase of $77 billion over 2017 purchases.
China's purchases have increased as its economy recovers from this year's coronavirus lockdown, however.

On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters he had postponed an Aug. 15 review of the trade pact, in frustration over Beijing's handling of the virus pandemic.

1030,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>",Merkel's conservatives clash with Scholz over debt brake,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has drawn criticism from Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives with his proposal to suspend the constitutionally enshrined debt brake in 2021 after abandoning it this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Scholz asked parliament in June to suspend the debt brake and allow record new borrowing of 217.8 billion euros ($258.14 billion) as Berlin tries to help companies and consumers recover more quickly from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Scholz, chancellor candidate for his centre-left Social Democrats in next year's federal election, said at an SPD event in Berlin late on Wednesday that the government would have to abandon the debt brake in 2021, too.
The move indicates he is trying to permanently move Germany away from its image as Europe's austerity champion and become one of the euro zone's biggest spenders before the election. 
But his proposal sparked fierce criticism from Merkel's chief budget lawmaker Eckhardt Rehberg.
""Suspending the debt brake must not become a habit. We have to get back to the regular debt limit as quickly as possible,"" Rehberg told Reuters on Thursday.
There was still no agreement in the coalition on whether the government should ask parliament to suspend the debt brake again in 2021 and allow higher spending, he said.
""It's the Bundestag that will pass the budget for 2021 in December, not the finance minister in August,"" Rehberg said, pointing to signs the economy was recovering and tax revenues developing better than expected.
He made clear, however, that Merkel's CDU/CSU bloc doesn't want to unleash an austerity program in an election year.

""With such a statement, the chancellor candidate is opening the race for additional spending,"" said Otto Fricke, chief budget lawmaker from the opposition pro-business Free Democrats.

1031,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 05:01AM ET</span>","Chinese EV maker Nio launches battery leasing service, eyes global market","BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio Inc (N:NIO) has launched a battery leasing service that will allow drivers to buy an EV without owning the battery pack - one of the most expensive EV components - thereby lowering the starting price of its cars.
The service, called ""battery as a service"" (BaaS), entails drivers paying a monthly rental fee for use of the batteries.
The cheapest Nio car after subsidies is now an ES6 sport-utility vehicle (SUV) priced 273,600 yuan ($39,553) without ownership of the battery pack, versus 343,600 yuan including the pack.
""We believe with BaaS, more customers of gasoline cars will consider electric vehicles,"" Nio's chief executive William Li told reporters.
Nio operates 143 battery-swapping stations around China, where drivers can swap spent battery packs for fully charged replacements. Li said Nio was building a new battery-swapping station in China every week and planned to build 300 new stations next year.
Li also said the firm hoped to enter some international markets from the second half of next year starting with some European countries. He added the firm aimed to enter more markets from 2022.
The industry ministry has said it would promote the adoption of vehicles with batteries that can be swapped between different makes and models.
To that end, Nio's battery packs are the same shape and size across its lineup, which is comprised of three SUVs. EV models from peer BAIC BluePark New Energy Technology Co Ltd (SS:600733) also have standardised batteries.
The batteries for Nio's leasing service will be supplied by a company established by Chinese battery makers including leader Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (SZ:300750). The company has registered capital of 800 million yuan, a government filing showed.

Interest rates on those loans averaged 5.27% in July, 0.91 percentage points lower than a year ago, the People's Bank of China said in a statement handed out ahead of a news conference in Beijing. 
Prudent monetary policy will be more flexible and appropriate, the PBOC said, while market rates would be guided towards the rates on the medium-term lending facility (MLF) and open market operation (OMO).

1034,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 04:09AM ET</span>",France Rules Out New Shutdown as Europe Grapples With Surging Virus,"(Bloomberg) -- French President Emmanuel Macron ruled out bringing the nation to a halt and Spain’s government appeared rudderless as Europe struggles with a resurgence of the coronavirus that threatens its tentative recovery.
France on Wednesday reported 3,776 new infections, the largest daily increase in three months, while Spain, which has re-emerged as an epicenter of the pandemic on the continent, recorded 3,715 new cases, the most since April 23. German infections increased by more than 1,000 for a third straight day on Thursday.
Europe’s economies were decimated by the crisis in the second quarter and governments are desperate to foster a swift recovery without triggering a broad new wave of the disease. The uptick in cases in recent weeks has been blamed on social gatherings and travelers, but officials are reluctant to resort to the strict lockdowns imposed during the initial peak of the pandemic in March and April.
“We cannot shut down the country, because the collateral damage of confinement is considerable,” Macron, who hosts German Chancellor Angela Merkel for talks later on Thursday, said in an interview with Paris Match magazine.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, meanwhile, is on vacation with his family and hasn’t come out to address the public even as bad news piles up.
Governments across Europe are tightening restrictions to combat the spread. In France, masks must now be worn in busy outdoor areas of Paris and Marseilles. Toulouse will require general mask-wearing starting Aug. 21, Agence France-Presse reported, the first large French city to do so.
The country’s response must be to “speed up vaccines, guarantee their access, and provide the best health response given what we know,” Macron told Paris Match, adding that, if necessary, authorities should resort to local “targeted” lockdowns. Testing, tracing, isolating the infected and broadening the wearing of masks when necessary are also key, he said.
With Spain’s tourism industry reeling and the economy on its knees, some voters are on edge and any perceived political indifference could hurt the weak minority government that relies on separatists to stay in power.
Widely Panned
Sanchez’s handling of the pandemic has been widely panned while Italy, which served as model for Spain in being the first to head into lockdown, appears to have a better handle on the crisis. Both countries are in deep recessions and had to try to balance the need to keep people safe with the desire to try and capitalize on a lucrative summer season.
Italy has also seen a pick up in new cases, albeit more contained than elsewhere. On Wednesday, the country reported 642 new infections, the biggest increase since May 23.
The government has closed nightclubs, banned dancing in public venues and made face masks compulsory from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. in all places, including streets and squares, where crowds can gather.
Recent outbreaks have been traced back to parties in seaside resorts such as Porto Rotondo in Sardinia, as well as to people returning from vacations abroad.
The government could even move to isolate Sardinia, one of the country’s busiest summer vacation regions, after a rise in coronavirus cases linked to the island, Corriere della Sera reported Thursday, citing unnamed ministry officials.
In Sweden, the government’s decision to adopt a light-touch strategy to tackle the pandemic pushed its death toll per capita many times higher than in the rest of the Nordic region.
However, the situation improved dramatically in July. The pace of infections in the country is now converging with those of neighboring Denmark and Norway, where governments are telling citizens to use face masks for the first time.

The ceiling will be capped at four times that of the loan prime rate (LPR), said He Xiaorong, a member of the Supreme Court's judicial committee, at an online new conference, meaning the upper limit of one-year private loan would be capped at about 15.4% based on the current LPR rate.

The index for business sentiment among bicycle retailers rose to 95 on a scale of 100, meaning nearly all firms in the sector were satisfied with their current situation, Ifo said.
""Bicycle dealers are experiencing a real boom,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said.
Other retailers doing relatively well during the pandemic include construction and DIY superstores, as well as food and delicatessen shops, the survey showed.
The biggest losers in the crisis are clothing and shoe retailers, as well as car dealers. ""For car dealers, things were already really bad before the crisis, and now they are getting out of the coronavirus slump rather slowly,"" Wohlrabe said.
The German economy, Europe's largest, contracted at its steepest rate on record in the second quarter as consumer spending, company investment and trade all collapsed during the peak of the pandemic.

But sentiment surveys and recent economic data point to a quick, V-shaped recovery as long as another big wave of new infections and a nationwide lockdown can be avoided.

1038,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 01:21AM ET</span>",North Korea to set new five-year plan in January as economy struggles,"By Sangmi Cha and Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's ruling party will hold a congress next year to decide a new five-year plan, state media reported on Thursday, after a party meeting noted serious delays in improving the national economy and living standards. 
The plenary meeting of the ruling Workers' Party on Wednesday convened a congress for January to set forth ""a correct line of struggle and strategic and tactical policies"" after reviewing lessons from the past five years, the official KCNA news agency said.
The meeting comes as the isolated country deals with international sanctions, struggles to cope with damage from recent flooding and faces significant economic damage from strict border closures and other measures aimed at preventing a coronavirus outbreak.
North Korea had faced ""unexpected and inevitable challenges in various aspects,"" Leader Kim Jong Un noted in a speech at the meeting, KCNA reported.
Goals for improving the economy had been ""seriously delayed and the people's living standard not been improved remarkably,"" KCNA quoted the plenary as saying.
While the reports did not detail what the new plans might include, the mention of work by an auditing committee hints that the congress could be another step to press people involved in private economic activity to give more of their resources to state coffers, said Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, a North Korean economy expert at the U.S-based Stimson Center think-tank. 
""Auditing is often code for greater scrutiny into the financial affairs of various organs, institutions and enterprises,"" he said. ""And this scrutiny, in turn, often entails the state scavenging for more money and resources.""
Kim announced the first five-year economic plan since the 1980s when the congress last met in 2016, also vowing to not use nuclear weapons unless the country's sovereignty was infringed by others with nuclear arms.

Last year, Kim vowed to make a breakthrough in the country's campaign to build a self reliant economy in the face of tightening sanctions aimed at curbing its nuclear and missile programmes.

1039,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 10:54PM ET</span>",Kim Jong Un’s Bleak Economic Assessment Hints at Growing Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- Kim Jong Un acknowledged that North Korea’s development goals have been “seriously delayed,” in the latest sign that sanctions, flooding and the coronavirus have dealt a triple blow to the country’s already anemic economy.
Kim told the first gathering of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea’s Central Committee in eight months that the country “faced unexpected and inevitable challenges in various aspects,” state media said Thursday. “Planned attainment of the goals for improving the national economy have been seriously delayed and the people’s living standard has not been improved remarkably,” Kim said, according to the Korean Central News Agency.
The statement was the latest in a series by Kim complaining about the pace of key policy goals, a striking admission for a state built on the infallibility of Kim family rule. In recent months, Kim has lashed out at cadres over what he saw as lax virus management and blasted the people responsible constructing his showcase Pyongyang General Hospital, saying they were flouting party policies and being “careless” with spending.
The North Korean leader also pledged to unveil a new five-year economic development plan at a ruling party congress to be held in January, without elaborating. The last five-year plan was unveiled in 2016.
Key party meetings often lead to a shake-up of cadres, which could mean new powers for prominent officials such as his sister, Kim Yo Jong, and a purge of others. At a Politburo meeting last week, Kim sacked the premier he appointed a little more than a year ago, removed the southern border city of Kaesong from virus lockdown and said he would not accept foreign food aid because of the risk posed by the pandemic.
While state media made no mention of the U.S.-led sanctions regime on the country, Pyongyang has repeatedly lashed out at the campaign. In December, Kim similarly told the Central Committee that “the conditions of the national economy have not turned better,” adding “the role of the state as the organizer of the economic work has not been enhanced.”
Kim is facing difficulties on various fronts, and a reported health scare earlier this year raised questions about succession. His nuclear discussions with President Donald Trump have ground to a halt without him winning any sanctions relief, and the U.S. and South Korea this week kicked off joint military drills.
“Unless there is a major change -- such as pushing for economic reform or improving relations with South Korea, China and/or Russia -- it would be difficult for North Korea to deliver the economic prosperity it vowed,” said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul who has advised the South Korean government over the years.
The economy was already under pressure from his decision to shut borders in January due to the coronavirus, which slammed the brakes on its minuscule legal trade. This year, the troubles could send the economy into its biggest contraction since 1997, according to Fitch Solutions.
Torrential rains that hit his state this summer have wiped out farmland, increasing food insecurity in the country where the United Nations World Food Program says about 40% of the population is undernourished.
North Korea has boasted that it doesn’t have any confirmed cases of Covid-19, a claim doubted by U.S. and Japanese officials.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy will not fully recover from its current historic downturn for at least two years, a Reuters poll of economists found, but there is only a slim chance the Bank of England will use negative interest rates to boost the upswing.
Britain has suffered the highest death toll from the novel coronavirus in Europe, leading to criticism of the government's response to the pandemic.
Last quarter, when a lockdown to quell the spread of the virus was at its tightest, the economy shrank a record 20.4%. But as many restrictions have been lifted, it was expected to expand 15.1% this quarter, the Aug. 14-19 poll showed.
""The severity of the slump was chiefly a by-product of the very long lockdown in the UK, necessitated by the government's laissez-faire attitude in the early days of the pandemic, which meant the virus spread more widely than in other countries,"" said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Earlier this month the BoE said the economy would not recover to its pre-pandemic size until the end of 2021, but 20 of 23 economists who responded to an extra question said it would be at least two years before that happened. Only three said within two years.
After contracting 9.7% this year - more than most of its peers and more than the 9.1% forecast last month - the economy will expand 6.2% in 2021, the poll of nearly 70 economists predicted. In a worst case scenario, it will contract 14.2% this year.
""Unlike BoE chief economist Andy Haldane, who thinks it is now time to see the economic glass as 'half-full', recent data outturns have made us more pessimistic about the lasting economic impact,"" said Elizabeth Martins at HSBC.
To support the economy the government has ramped up spending to record amounts, the centrepiece of which was to pay 80% of wage bills if staff were put on leave rather than let go.
But that scheme is due to finish at the end of October, and all respondents to an extra question said the risk that the job market will worsen significantly before this year draws to a close was high or very high.
""Evidence of job losses is already mounting and the planned phasing out of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme in the autumn will make things worse,"" said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
The economic slump has pushed firms to slash thousands of jobs. While the unemployment rate unexpectedly held at 3.9% in June it was seen peaking at 8.0% in the fourth quarter, the poll found.
STAY POSITIVE
For its part, the Bank of England has chopped borrowing costs to 0.10% and restarted asset purchases.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey has said that negative interest rates, used by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, were part of the Bank's toolbox but that it did not have any plans to use them for now.
Bank Rate was expected to remain at 0.10% until 2023 at least, forecasts showed, and when asked about the chance of negative interest rates, economists gave just a 22.5% median probability. Only two economists polled had sub-zero rates as their base case scenario somewhere in the forecast horizon.
Meanwhile, Britain faces the added task of trying to agree a trade deal with the European Union before a transition period following its departure from the bloc finishes at the end of this year.
Reuters polls have consistently predicted that the two sides would agree a deal, and the latest survey gave only a 30% chance that no agreement would be reached before the transition period ends. 
""The UK economy faces a trifecta of risks this winter, stemming from possibly renewed COVID-19-related restrictions, an economically difficult Brexit, and significant labour market weakness,"" said Stefan Koopman at Rabobank.

1041,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 08:20PM ET</span>",Euro zone economic outlook steady but job recovery at high risk: Reuters Poll,"By Shrutee Sarkar and Richa Rebello
BENGALURU (Reuters) - A full bounceback from the euro zone's deepest recession on record will take two years or more, according to a Reuters poll of economists who also said there is a high risk the job recovery underway reverses by the end of 2020.
Europe was badly hit earlier this year by the coronavirus pandemic, which has now infected more than 22 million people globally. But stringent lockdowns and contact tracing helped get the numbers down and allowed swift re-openings. 
Along with trillions of euros' worth of European Central Bank stimulus and a 750 billion euro European Union recovery fund that kicks in next year, sentiment has improved, and the economy is bouncing back along with the euro.
The consensus from the Aug 14-19 Reuters poll points to 8.1% growth this quarter compared with the previous one, easily the fastest on record, following a historic 12.1% contraction in Q2. That is unchanged from the July poll median.
In May, around the time lockdowns were lifted in most euro zone countries, the Q3 forecast was for 7.2% growth. 
Quarterly growth will then slow sharply to 3.0% in Q4, slightly better than the 2.8% predicted last month and still a historically robust rate.
However, more than 70% of economists, or 25 of 35 who replied to an additional question, said it would take two or more years for euro zone GDP to reach pre-COVID-19 levels. Ten respondents said within two years and none said within a year.
""Despite the recent recovery in economic indicators, the better-than-feared performance of labour markets and the recent agreement on the Recovery Fund, we still see various downside risks to the economic recovery,"" said Elwin de Groot, head of macro strategy at Rabobank. 
""Although there have been encouraging reports with regard to a potential (COVID-19) vaccine by early 2021, as long there isn't any effective one, containment measures will have to be kept in place regardless. A second series of partial lockdowns could have some serious economic effects.""
Around three-quarters of common contributors to this month's and last month's poll either lowered their GDP forecasts for the remainder of the year or kept them unchanged.
Asked to predict their worst-case scenario, the median response was 4.0% this quarter, much better than the 2.0% forecast in last month's poll. But the worst-case view points to a 2.0% contraction in Q4, the most pessimistic yet for that period.
On an annual basis, the economy was expected to shrink 8.2% this year and then grow 5.5% next, or -10.3% this year and no growth in 2021 on a worst-case basis.
Much will depend on how the job market performs from now on.
Thanks to wide-reaching government furlough programmes that have helped businesses retain workers, euro zone unemployment has risen only slightly to 7.8% in July from 7.2% in February.
But about 85% of economists in the poll, 28 of 33 who responded to an additional question, said the risk the job recovery reverses by year-end was high, including four who said very high.
""Euro zone unemployment almost looks like a Cinderella story. With barely any increase in unemployment, it is currently the belle of the global labour market ball, at least compared to many other developed economies,"" said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist, eurozone and global head of macro at ING. 
""When the clock strikes midnight, however, and short-term work schemes come to an end, the fairy tale is unlikely to continue. We expect a second wave of job losses towards the end of the year and going into 2021."" 
The jobless rate is expected to rise to 8.9% in 2020 and 9.3% in 2021, according to a July Reuters poll. 
Inflation was not expected to touch the ECB's target of below, but close to 2% through to 2022, according to the latest August survey. The ECB's key interest rates are expected to stay on hold through the forecast horizon.

1042,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 08:05PM ET</span>",India faces protracted slowdown as virus clouds rural revival,"By Swati Bhat and Manoj Kumar
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is staring at a protracted slowdown as coronavirus cases reach its countryside, with signs of recovery in the rural economy hailed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""at best a mitigating factor"", government officials and analysts said.
The world's No.5 economy reports first-quarter GDP data on Aug. 31 and, according to a Reuters poll, it is likely to have contracted 20% over April-June. It is forecast to shrink 5.1% in the year to March 2021, the weakest since 1979.
Nearly half of India's 1.38 billion population rely on agriculture to survive, with the sector accounting for 15% of its economic output.
Modi has been citing higher fertiliser demand and sowing of monsoon crops, both key signs of rural activity, to show there are ""green shoots"" in the economy.
But four government officials said the uptick in activity may not be as large as believed given a spike in virus cases in rural areas that were initially isolated from the pandemic. 
""The economic situation has in fact worsened since April and May, and we are likely moving towards a longer economic slowdown than earlier expected,"" a finance ministry official said.
The official pointed to sluggish consumer demand and a slowdown in rural lending as causes for concern. 
""The situation on the economy front is very serious and the government's hands are tied on the fiscal front,"" a government adviser with direct knowledge of India's budget plans said.
Both declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to media. A ministry spokesman declined to comment. 
'AT  BEST  (NYSE:BEST) A MITIGATING FACTOR'
A slump in monthly demand for fuel, electricity, steel, consumer durables and auto sales over April-June further highlight the dire state of the economy.
India also has the third-highest number of virus infections in the world at more than 2.7 million, and new cases are increasingly emerging outside major cities, dashing hopes the rural economy will be a buffer against shrinking exports and manufacturing.
""While a recovery in rural activity provides a glimmer of hope, it is at best a mitigating factor,"" said Rahul Bajoria, a  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economist. Bajoria expects India's GDP to have contracted 22.2% in the June quarter.
Farmers planted nearly 14% more land between June 1 and July 31 than last year given good monsoon rains, while fertiliser production rose 4.2% in June.
""Even as the momentum coming from the agriculture sector owing to a normal monsoon and robust sowing is a positive, we believe this may not sustain due to surplus labour concerns, along with an increasing proportion of active COVID-19 cases,"" said Upasna Bhardwaj, economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank.
Rating agency ICRA believes pent-up demand contributed to some improvement in manufacturing in June and July, and that it may not continue in August due to virus-related lockdowns. 
A widening fiscal deficit may also limit India's ability to provide more stimulus, though Finance Minister Nirmala Sithamaran has promised to take steps for industries like tourism and hospitality. 
India's fiscal deficit hit a record $88.5 billion over April to June, already 83.2% of the target for the whole fiscal year, due to lower tax collections and front-loaded spending.
CENBANK HELP
India's central bank has frontloaded interest rate cuts, but many feel demand is likely to remain subdued until virus worries subside and the government pumps in more money.
""Flattening of India's virus curve is critical for a pickup in production. Once the economy unlocks fully, we expect exports to lead to recovery and domestic demand to lag,"" said Kapil Gupta, chief economist, Edelweiss Research.
Former central bank Governor Raghuram Rajan has called for greater focus on protecting India's economic capabilities for a meaningful revival.

""As is the case with most countries in the region, there is bound to be some permanent damage to output, setting recovery back by a few years to return to pre-COVID trend,"" said Radhika Rao, a DBS economist.

1043,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 06:20PM ET</span>",UK trade minister accused by opponents of hiding think-tank meetings,"By Andy Bruce and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's trade minister has reclassified recent meetings with a pro-hard Brexit think tank as personal discussions, removing them from the public record and sparking opposition allegations that she wants to conceal their influence on public policy.
The Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) is widely regarded as one of Britain's most influential right-leaning think tanks. It promotes free-markets and has argued strongly for a clean break from the European Union since the 2016 Brexit referendum.
Two meetings with trade minister Liz Truss and the IEA had originally been included in quarterly transparency data published on the government's website and described as discussing trade. They were removed on Wednesday with a note explaining they were personal meetings - the first such revision since the department was created in 2016.
The opposition Labour Party said Truss appeared to be evading rules designed to ensure integrity, transparency and honesty in public office. Government rules require meetings with external organisations that discuss official business to be declared.
""It makes no sense for Liz Truss now to claim that meetings on those issues had nothing to do with her ministerial role, and suggests instead that she has something to hide, whether in terms of who attended the meetings or what specifically was discussed,"" said a spokesman for Emily Thornberry, head of Labour's trade policy brief.
The Department for International Trade said the meetings were initially included due to an administrative error, and they held no information about them. They declined to comment when asked how a meeting on trade and investment could be considered a personal meeting. 
The IEA said it regularly hosted events and meetings with ministers and others, but did not provide any further details of the meetings with Truss.

""By definition, the private events we run do not involve the minuting or publication of the full, frank and free exchange of views which we try to ensure takes place,"" a spokeswoman said.

Tax receipts of the federal government and the 16 regional state governments edged down by 0.3% year-on-year after tumbling in the previous months, the ministry said in its monthly report.
The German economy, Europe's largest, contracted at its steepest rate on record in the second quarter as consumer spending, company investment and trade collapsed during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic.
From January to July, tax revenues fell 8%, less than an estimated drop of nearly 10% for the whole year, the finance ministry said.
The ministry pointed to recent increases in industrial output and exports, adding that business and consumer sentiment surveys also pointed to a further improvement.
""For the coming months, industrial production is expected to recover further,"" the ministry said.
The government said in April it expected the economy to shrink by 6.3% this year and rebound in 2021 with an expansion of 5.2%. This means that the economy is unlikely to reach its pre-crisis level before 2022.
The government is expected to update its growth forecasts and tax revenue estimates in September.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz hope that a massive stimulus package, worth more than 130 billion euro ($155 billion) including a temporary VAT cut to boost domestic demand, will help the economy return to growth.
Parliament has suspended the constitutionally enshrined debt brake, allowing the federal government to increase annual new borrowing by a record 217.8 billion euros this year.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Emergency payments to Brazil's poor could be extended through the end of the year, President Jair Bolsonaro said on Wednesday, but at a lower rate than the current 600 reais ($108) a month. 
The payments are widely cited as one reason why the economy appears to have recovered from the depths of the coronavirus crisis more quickly than many had expected, but are due to expire next month.
The government and the country at large are debating whether the payments should be extended and by how much, given the parlous state of public finances.
Bolsonaro said continuing with 600 reais a month is not an option as that would jeopardize Brazil's fiscal credibility. At the same time, one of the proposals put forward by the economy ministry, of 200 reais a month, is not enough.
""We can reach a middle ground and we will try to extend it for a few more months, perhaps until the end of the year,"" Bolsonaro said in Brasilia alongside Economy Minister Paulo Guedes.
Guedes again insisted that the government cannot afford 600 reais a month, but said it will do all it can within its means to extend the program that has reached 64 million Brazilians.
The aid package costs the government more than 50 billion reais a month.
Meanwhile, Guedes said the economy is recovering in the shape of a  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) ""swoosh"", and that a program to help finance company payrolls will more than double its reach in the coming months to over 200,000 companies.

Guedes also said 200 billion to 300 billion reais of credit will be made available to small businesses by the end of the year.

Kudlow, speaking to reporters at the White House, defended a reduction in the unemployment supplement to $300 from $600, saying stimulus measures should be reduced slowly as the economy strengthens.
""I think the economy is on a self-sustaining recovery and it's a V-shaped recovery,"" he said. ""We're seeing terrific numbers."" 
Asked about concerns that a second wave of coronavirus infections this autumn and winter could derail the recovery, Kudlow said: ""The hope is that the decline in cases and fatalities will continue. That's the great hope.""
He said the number of infections should continue to decline since more Americans were now using face masks, maintaining social distancing and regularly washing their hands.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Wednesday reported 5,460,429 cases of the novel coronavirus in the country, an increase of 39,318 from its previous count, and said the number of deaths had risen by 1,172 to 171,012.
Kudlow said the White House was looking at different ways to ensure that the payroll tax cut called for by President Donald Trump would be forgiven.
""As far as the payback is concerned, ... you could stretch that out over a long period of time,"" Kudlow told reporters. ""So the payback won't be immediate and no one will be hurt.""

He said the payback could occur over five to eight years since the budget window was 10 years. The amount in question was roughly $1,100 per worker for four months, he said.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 04:55PM ET</span>",Fed's Barkin says uncertainty is weighing on U.S. outlook,"By Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - Uncertainty is weighing on the U.S. economic outlook, Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Thomas Barkin warned on Wednesday, keeping households from spending, businesses from investing and even banks from extending credit. 
To reduce that uncertainty, he said, at least two things are needed: better control of the coronavirus, and more government aid for the unemployed and for businesses.
""We simply need to get this virus under control to give people confidence and certainty,"" Barkin told the National Economists Club in a virtual event. But the economy also needs ""continued fiscal support"" to get through this period, he said.
The White House and U.S. lawmakers have failed to reach agreement on a new rescue package, after key parts of a $2.3 trillion law passed in March expired in recent weeks. The government aid helped cushion the economy from what would have been an even worse downturn, Barkin said. 
""We need to be aware of two economies: there's the one we see in the numbers, and the one we might see if we weren't benefiting from unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus,"" he said. Many small businesses, for instance, might have filed for bankruptcy during the first wave of shutdowns if not for the government's now-closed Paycheck Protection Program.

""Fiscal stimulus in particular was very useful to put money in people's pockets"" and much of it has been spent, he said. ""If we do not have further business support and stimulus programs, then we will see what the underlying looks like, post-Covid.""

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",Several Fed policymakers see more easing ahead to help brace economy,"By Ann Saphir and Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - Several Federal Reserve policymakers say the U.S. central bank may need to ease monetary policy further to help nurse the economy through the coronavirus pandemic, minutes from their policy meeting last month showed on Wednesday. 
The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero and bought trillions of dollars of bonds in response to the economic crisis spurred by virus, moves which have provided a boost to jobs and spending. 
But, according to the readout of the July 28-29 policy meeting, members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee saw the rebound in employment already slowing and additional ""substantial improvement"" hinging on a ""broad and sustained"" reopening of business activity.
Since last month, the number of new daily coronavirus infections has dropped, but is still averaging around 50,000, slowing business reopenings and, in some parts of the country, forcing schools to delay, reverse, or abandon plans to conduct in-person classes.
""Noting the increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook over the intermeeting period, several participants suggested that additional accommodation could be required to promote economic recovery and return inflation to the Committee’s 2% objective,"" the minutes from the meeting said.
Policymakers last month discussed a range of possible approaches that could be appropriate ""at some point,"" including promising to keep interest rates low until certain economic benchmarks are met, or until a particular future date. The Fed used both options effectively during the last recession. 
In what would be a novel approach for the Fed, policymakers also expressed little support for adopting caps or targets for Treasury yields. ""Many participants judged that yield caps and targets were not warranted in the current environment but should remain an option"" for the future, the minutes said.
The apparent swearing-off of pursuing a form of Treasury yield curve control did not go down well in the Treasury market. Yields on 30-year bonds and 10-year notes both rose notably.
""It seems the market is quite displeased with the discussion about yield curve control specifically,"" said Tom Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) in New York.
MONETARY GAS PEDAL
The minutes also showed policymakers were nearing agreement on changes to the Fed's policy framework, including its periodic ""Statement of Longer-run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,"" that could result in the U.S. central bank sticking with aggressive stimulus measures far longer than under its previous rubric.
Fed officials ""agreed that ... refining the statement could be helpful in increasing the transparency and accountability of monetary policy,"" the minutes reported. 
""Participants noted that the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy serves as the foundation for the Committee's policy actions and that it would be important to finalize all changes to the statement in the near future."" 
Policymakers decided to revamp their policy approach in late 2018, when they worried that low inflation and low interest rates globally would mean they would need stronger tools than before to combat future recessions. 
That was well before the pandemic ended a record-long period of growth and sent the world's biggest economy into its sharpest downturn since the 1930s. 
At the current juncture, with the U.S. unemployment rate at 10.2%, drastic cuts this month in government aid to households and businesses, and the virus continuing to spread, changing the Fed's overarching framework may have little short-term impact on policy. 
But it could signal the Fed's readiness to keep its foot on the monetary gas pedal, and perhaps to take even more aggressive action ahead. 
At the July policy meeting, all 17 policymakers supported leaving the target range for short-term rates between 0% and 0.25%, the minutes showed. 
They also said the outlook for the economy hinged on the outlook for the virus, which has now killed more than 171,000 people in the United States, according to a Reuters tally.

And a number of participants said that since many provisions of the government's massive late-March coronavirus rescue package are due to expire while the labor market is still weak, ""additional fiscal aid would likely be important for supporting vulnerable families, and thus the economy more broadly, in the period ahead.""

1050,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 03:25PM ET</span>",Canada's Trudeau needs to spend to survive autumn confidence votes,"By David Ljunggren and Steve Scherer
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government will likely survive a confidence vote next month but needs to invest in social programs to secure the opposition support he needs to stay in power, especially with a second, riskier vote coming later in the year.
Trudeau said on Tuesday he would introduce ""bold new solutions"" as part of a plan to help Canada recover from the coronavirus pandemic. He will put it to a vote in September which, if lost, will trigger an election. 
The Liberals only control a minority of seats in parliament and need opposition legislators to govern. The most obvious choice is the New Democratic Party (NDP), which competes for the same center-left voters. 
""I think we will find it easy to vote in favor"" as long as there are no obvious poison pills, such as spending cuts, a senior NDP source said on Wednesday. 
The NDP is short of money and would find it hard to go to the polls now, the source added. As long as the party backs the Liberals, Trudeau will have enough support to govern.
Trudeau's main rivals are the right-leaning Conservatives, who will elect a new leader this Sunday. The Conservatives would need both the NDP and the separatist Bloc Quebecois - the three hold a combined 177 seats to the Liberals' 156 - to bring down Trudeau, who says he does not want an election. 
Three Conservative strategists told Reuters there was little or no chance of an election being triggered next month, citing the likelihood of NDP support for the Liberals.
But in order to stay in power, Trudeau will need to offer the NDP enough of an incentive to back the Liberals when they unveil a fiscal update later in the year, which is also subject to a confidence vote.
The NDP source said the party would need to see major investments in at least one of its priorities. These include a national childcare program, universal dental care and a reform to employment insurance payments.
""We want to see real action ... if people conclude that all the Liberals are doing is talking, then there are a lot of soft left votes we could take in the next election,"" said the source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.
Even if the Liberals think they can take advantage of NDP weakness and a new Conservative leader, Canadians may object to a vote so soon after an October 2019 election, especially if there is a second COVID-19 wave.
Senior cabinet minister Dominic LeBlanc said the government and opposition had already been discussing some of the plans that Trudeau will unveil next month.
""So we don't think there would be any reason for the opposition to force an election,"" he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp on Wednesday.
Not everyone thinks the Liberals can or even want to avoid an early election. Pollster Nik Nanos of Nanos Research said the Liberals would benefit from going to the polls while Ottawa is still sending out stimulus checks.

""I think their political calculus is to have an election before Canadians hit an economic wall,"" he said. ""Once some Canadians cannot pay their rent or meet their mortgage, there will be political hell to pay.""

1051,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>",Canada's economic growth seen outpacing U.S. as virus containment pays off,"By Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - A staggered reopening from lockdowns, supported by fiscal stimulus, is likely paying off for Canada's economy, with activity forecast to rebound in the current quarter twice as fast as in the United States, its biggest trading partner by far.
Canada's economy is set to grow at an annualized rate of 36% in the third quarter, compared to 20% for the United States, the average forecasts of Canada's six largest banks showed. That reflects some catch-up for Canada after an estimated deeper slump in the second quarter, but also greater success at controlling the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
The number of daily new cases in Canada has slowed to less than 400, using a 7-day moving average, from about 1,800 at its peak in May, according to Canada's Public Health Agency. A spike in U.S. infections last month led to some states making a U-turn on reopening their economies.
Helped by a surge in employment, surging housing sales and gains in credit card spending, Canadian economic activity recovered in July to about 95% of pre-pandemic levels, BMO Capital Markets estimated.
Signs of a fast start to economic recovery could be welcomed by credit rating agencies, after Canada was stripped in June of one of its triple-A ratings by Fitch. 
It could also be welcome news for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government after the resignation of the country's finance minister on Monday amid friction over pandemic aid spending.
""The phased reopening of the Canadian economy, combined with its lower starting point due to stricter public health measures, will mean a more vigorous bounce-back in Canada,"" said Matthieu Arseneau, deputy chief economist at National Bank Financial.
Since May, Canada's provinces have been reopening their economies in stages. To bridge the crisis, Ottawa has announced more than C$300 billion, or about 14% of gross domestic product, in stimulus measures, including wage subsidies and income support.
""The extraordinary amount of fiscal support that has been put in place has laid the foundation for the recovery that we're starting to see toward the end of Q2 and that we think is continuing in Q3,"" said Josh Nye, a senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada.
Complementing fiscal measures, the Bank of Canada has cut interest rates to near zero and begun its first large-scale asset-purchase program. It has expanded its balance sheet as a share of GDP this year by more than the U.S. Federal Reserve and some other major counterparts.
Economists say that further gains for the economy will be challenged by the unknown path the virus could take and a tenuous recovery globally, but especially in the United States, where Canada sends 75% of its exports. 

""The recovery is going about as well as anyone could have realistically hoped for a few short months ago,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.

With the breakdown of talks between the White House and top congressional Democrats now in its 12th day, Senate Republicans are floating a ""skinny"" version of the $1 trillion bill proposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for a possible vote in the Republican-led chamber.
That bill ran into immediate opposition from both Democrats and McConnell's own Republicans when he unveiled it late last month.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows called on Democrats to use Saturday's vote on U.S. Postal Service legislation in the House of Representatives as a vehicle for coronavirus relief including stimulus checks for individuals and funding for personal protective equipment and schools.
""I think the outlook for a skinny deal is better than it's ever been and yet we are still not there,"" Meadows told reporters. ""If Speaker (Nancy) Pelosi moves forward a single bill on postal ... let's add in the things we can agree upon.""
But leading Democrats have flatly rejected White House and Republican calls for narrow legislation, saying Americans need broad legislation and accusing Republicans of failing to grasp the severity of the crisis.
House Democratic leaders are resisting calls by some centrist Democrats, including Representative Derek Kilmer, to hold a separate vote Saturday on extending federal unemployment benefits.
""Saturday focus is postal,"" a senior Democratic aide said, adding that there's ""still more consensus building in (the) caucus to be done.""
Democratic Senator Tim Kaine said that he does not expect the White House to get serious about negotiations until after next week's Republican presidential election convention, where he expects Republicans to tout President Donald Trump's executive orders on coronavirus relief.
""Once we get out of the Republican convention, the week before Labor Day, you're going to see serious negotiations restart. And that means we could do something possibly right after Labor Day, when we return,"" Kaine said in an online interview with Politico.

The Senate is due to return from recess on Sept. 8 and the House on Sept. 14.

1053,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Fed's Bullard - Wall Street 'about right' as U.S. muddles through virus risk,"By Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - A stock market hitting record highs in a pandemic might seem out of touch, but St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard says Wall Street has got it right and he expects the United States to do better than many forecasters anticipate as businesses and households learn to manage coronavirus risks.
Though the situation seems chaotic, with federal, state and local officials laying out competing ideas about what activities are safe and under what conditions, Bullard said that shows adaptation in process, and will allow the country to fine-tune behavior and economic activity to what a ""persistent"" health threat allows.
""I think Wall Street has called this about right so far,"" he said, noting how firms like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), with its mandatory masking and other rules, have found ways to operate that others will copy. 
""There is a lot of ability to mitigate and proceed and most of the data has surprised to the upside...So I think we are going to do somewhat better,"" Bullard said in an interview with Reuters. ""I expect more businesses to be able to operate and more of the economy to be able to run...successfully in the second half of 2020.""
Bullard said he sees the U.S. economy shrinking 4% for the year, substantially more optimistic then the -6.5% median projection his colleagues made in June, and also less dire than the median forecast of economists polled by Reuters in mid-July. That saw a 5.6% hit to GDP for the year, with a catastrophic annualized decline of 32.9% in the April to June period offset by what will likely be similarly outsized growth numbers in the third and fourth quarters.
The Fed cut interest rates to zero in March and rolled out trillions of dollars in bond buying and other programs to support the economy. There may be more to come, but Bullard said he does not see a rush to make either longer-term promises about interest rates or to try to amp up the economy through more stimulus efforts.
That should wait, he said, until the health risks are more contained and the Fed wants to actively encourage more borrowing, spending, and activity to boost the economy when it is safer for people to fully engage in commerce again.
""At least for now expectations are that the Fed will stay where we are for a very long time,"" Bullard said. ""The idea that you want to stimulate things presupposes that the virus has gone away.""
RISKS STILL HIGH
The focus should be on managing through the next period, and Bullard acknowledged the risks are substantial - whether from the behavior of the virus as the weather grows colder and the conventional flu season arrives, or the drag on the economy as unemployed families lose government benefits and spending power.
Bullard said he feels optimistic on both fronts. 
With a national vote coming in November, ""you probably have Congress doing what Congress always does - pass a stopgap measure to get past the election,"" that restores at least some of the benefits that have kept U.S. consumer spending on track and limited the number of loan defaults and bankruptcies.
On the health crisis Bullard acknowledged that his earlier, provocative call that the economy could be stopped in its tracks, kept afloat with government aid, and just as quickly restarted, was ""shattered"" because the virus ""proved to be more persistent.""
But it also, he argued, has proved less deadly than early estimates of 1 million to 2 million U.S. deaths in 2020. Around 172,000 Americans have died so far, and the current 7-day moving average of daily deaths, at roughly 1,000, is about half where it was in April.
That, he argued, means another lockdown would be inappropriate - a view counter to at least one of his colleagues, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who called for a strict perhaps six-week lockdown of the economy to ""crush"" the virus.
""That is appropriate at the initial phase,"" Bullard said. ""Now you know a lot more...about which situations are dangerous and which are not so dangerous, so you can have more granular policy that mitigates risk...That is exactly what is happening.""
""You don't need to shut down businesses that you don't need to shut down.""

Investing.com -- Federal Reserve members continued to back accommodative monetary policy measures to keep the economic recovery on solid footing amid ongoing worries about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the July meeting minutes released Wednesday.
At the conclusion of its previous meeting on July 28-29, the Fed kept its benchmark rate unchanged in range of 0% to 0.25% and stressed that rates would be kept near-zero until it was ""confident that the economy has weathered recent events."" At the meeting, Fed officials discussed the ongoing economic fallout of the viral pandemic, which shut down businesses and cost millions of Americans their jobs.
""We projected rate of recovery in real GDP, and the pace of declines in the unemployment rate, over the second half of this year were expected to be somewhat less robust than in the previous forecast,"" the Fed said in the minutes. 
The Fed also said the rebound in consumer spending from its trough in April had been ""particularly strong,"" supported by fiscal stimulus measures. ""Participants observed that with this rebound, household spending likely had recovered about half of its previous decline."" 
Looking ahead, the Fed continued to suggest that further improvements in the labor market would depend on the progress of reopening the economy.  ""Participants generally agreed that prospects for further substantial improvement in the labor market would depend on a broad and sustained reopening of businesses. In turn, such a reopening would depend in large part on the efficacy of health measures taken to limit the spread of the virus.""
The Fed has pledged not to raise rates anytime in the near future, until inflation and employment numbers hit their mark. But with inflation lagging the Fed's 2% target, policymakers appear in no rush to lift rates.
The recent low monthly readings of PCE prices, the Fed's preferred inflation measures, suggested the pace of inflation would likely ""continue to run well below the committee's 2 percent objective for some time,"" the Fed's minutes showed.  ""Participants also noted that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would likely be needed for some time to support aggregate demand and achieve 2 percent inflation over the longer run.""
While short-term rates are targeted near zero, longer-term real interest rates have turned negative. That has sent the price of gold soaring to a record above $2,000 an ounce while the dollar has tumbled against other world currencies.
Markets surged ahead of the release of the minutes. Traders and investors were looking for any changes to the central bank's thinking on the economic recovery, especially given improved jobs and other economic data that has come out since the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting last month.
What remains to be seen is whether the Fed will be more accommodative than it was even after the financial crisis. Twelve years ago, the Fed cut rates to zero  and held them there for six years, long after the economy and markets had recovered. "

1056,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 10:55AM ET</span>",London to maintain grip on EU financial market plumbing post Brexit,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - London will remain a big part of Europe's financial market plumbing well beyond Brexit as the coronavirus pandemic has thwarted Frankfurt's ambitions to grab billions of euros worth of derivatives clearing business from Britain. 
Clearing ensures financial market trades are completed even if one side of the transaction goes bust. It is a high-volume, low-margin business but a critical part of market infrastructure. London’s leading role in the clearing business has helped to cement its status as Europe’s top financial centre.
Other European centres, such as Frankfurt, keen to claw back a chunk of this business, saw Brexit as a chance to reduce London's grip on clearing euro-denominated trades.
But Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn)'s Eurex Clearing, considered the strongest candidate to take business from the London Stock Exchange’s clearing division LCH, said its euro clearing had grown more slowly than expected due to delays in regulation changes, the COVID-19 pandemic and a broader reticence by banks to shift from London.
""There is a slower growth path than we initially had expected for the second half of this year primarily due to COVID-19 and its implications, but everything is going in the right direction to achieve our goals,"" Eurex Clearing board member Matthias Graulich told Reuters. 
Eurex said it accounts for 19 trillion euros ($22.67 trillion) of the total market of 100 trillion euros in notional outstanding value in euro interest rate derivatives and forward contracts, with LCH taking the rest.
In swaps alone, Eurex has 7.3 trillion euros, or 14% of the market, compared with 45.8 trillion euros at LCH. Eurex has a goal of reaching an overall euro clearing target of 25 trillion euros by the end of 2020.
""It is extremely difficult to say where we are on the journey to achieve our goals by 31 Dec, a year-end is not a magic date if you are building a business, it is more relevant that the trajectory is up and we make month-by-month progress,"" Graulich said.
He said a new rule that requires market participants like asset managers to provide margin - a form of deposit - against swap trades for the first time will lead to greater use of Eurex by new customers.
But the rule has been delayed by a year to September 2021 due to COVID-19. Graulich also said several banks had put off plans to close swaps positions in London and reopen them in Frankfurt when the pandemic was disrupting markets and while many traders were working from home.
The LSE said there had been no discernible shift in clearing from London. 
Lawyers said banks will not move positions from London to Frankfurt voluntarily because of costs and complexity at a time when they are firefighting the pandemic.
Given the lack of movement, the EU is set to decide in the next few weeks on the length of time it will allow LCH's clearing of euro swaps for EU customers to continue after Britain's full access to the EU ends in December.
""It's very hard to see why the EU is playing around with a time limit because Catch 22 remains in full force with banks not moving positions unless ordered to,"" said Simon Gleeson, a financial services lawyer at Clifford Chance. 
There is a political cost for Britain to maintain EU access for its financial services industry - the Bank of England will have to allow EU securities watchdog ESMA to jointly supervise LCH. 
The BoE has said ""multiple hands on the wheel"" in a crisis could create confusion. The Bank said this month that clarity was needed by the end of September to avoid market disruption.
ESMA said it was working to ensure timely access decisions.
Some loss of London's clearing business to the EU is seen as inevitable once the pandemic has passed.
Graulich said the EU wants power over business like euro clearing and that the amounts of business cleared inside and outside the EU will affect decisions on access for Britain.
""The EU needs to develop its own financial market eco-system with Brexit now ultimately happening. Taking a five to ten year perspective, it is success critical for the EU.""

1057,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 09:11AM ET</span>",U.S. official sees 'real desire' for smaller coronavirus relief bill,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - Some Democrats and Republicans have a ""real desire"" to reach agreement on a smaller coronavirus relief bill that could be worth around $500 billion, a senior Trump administration official said late on Tuesday.
The official said the agreement could include funding for the U.S. Postal Service, additional funding for loans to small- and medium-sized businesses to keep workers on their payrolls and potentially added money for schools.
""I think there’s a real desire by some in the Democratic caucus and some in the Republican conference, both in the House and the Senate, to do a smaller deal on the things we can agree upon,"" the official said. ""It could be about $500 billion.""
That amount still falls far short of what Democrats have been seeking in protracted discussions with the administration.
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday said Democrats in Congress are willing to cut their relief bill in half to get an agreement on new legislation.
""We have to try to come to that agreement now,"" Pelosi said in an online interview with Politico. ""We're willing to cut our bill in half to meet the needs right now.""
The Democratic-led House passed legislation with over $3 trillion in relief in May. Democrats offered this month to reduce that sum by $1 trillion, but the White House rejected it. 
The two sides remain about $2 trillion apart, with wide gaps on funding for schools, aid to state and local governments, and enhanced unemployment benefits.

The senior administration official said while a narrow agreement was possible on some issues, he did not see aid to state and local governments and a fresh round of stimulus checks as possible at the moment.

1058,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 06:42AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday, August 19th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Chances for a compromise on the next round of fiscal stimulus rise, but eyes are on the release of the Federal Reserve's minutes for hints of more immediate support. The dollar continued to weaken. Inflation runs ahead of expectations in Europe, at least for now. Stocks are expected to build on Tuesday's record close for the S&P 500 and oil is becalmed ahead of an OPEC+ meeting. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, August 19th. 
1. Pelosi, McConnell signal willingness to compromise
The chances of a compromise deal on the latest round of economic relief measures appeared to rise after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated she would drop many of her demands in order to secure a short-term deal.
“We’re willing to cut our bill in half to meet the needs right now,” Pelosi told an event organized by a Politico, adding: “We’ll take it up again in January.”
Bloomberg later reported her spokesman as clarifying her comments to mean that the Democrats would meet the skinnier Republican proposal halfway, rather than “cutting our bill in half.”
Bloomberg reported that Senate Republicans are now drafting a pared-down proposal, featuring some money for the U.S. Postal Service, supplemental unemployment payments and aid for small businesses and for school reopenings.  Senate Leader Mitch McConnell said however that the Senate would not back a bill on funding the USPS currently being prepared by House Democrats.
2. Fed minutes to be scanned for policy shift signs
With fiscal policy still effectively deadlocked, the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting at 2 PM ET (1800 GMT) is likely to garner more attention that it might otherwise do.
Most short-term economic indicators have indicated a flattening out of the rebound since the last meeting, something that will encourage market participants to parse the minutes for any language about what would be sufficient to trigger further stimulus.
John Velis, FX strategist at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK), said in a note to clients that any sign of a move to yield curve targeting could be interpreted as a signal that the Fed is preparing fresh action. The release comes against a backdrop of mounting speculation that the Fed may shift its strategy to pursue an average inflation target over multiple years, effectively committing it to run the economy hotter for longer as it emerges from the pandemic.
Such speculation continued to weigh on the dollar on Wednesday. By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of developed market currencies was only 0.1% above the 28-month low it hit on Tuesday at 92.237.
3. Stocks set to build on new S&P high
U.S. stock markets are set to open modestly higher, with the S&P 500 building on the new record high close it achieved on Tuesday.
By 6:30 AM ET, the Dow 30 futures contract was up 41 points or 0.1%, while US 500 Futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were up in parallel.
The day starts with an earnings update from Target and Lowe’s and discount fashion giant TJX and ends with reports from L Brands – owner of Victoria’s Secret – and, more importantly, chipmaker Nvidia.
4. Inflation ticks up in Europe
Inflation ticked up in the U.K. and euro zone in July, but analysts dismissed the development as ""noise"" generated by the difficulties of collating data in the current circumstances. The core CPI rate in the euro zone rose to 1.2% from 0.8%, due largely to clothes and services prices. The headline number would have been even higher without the temporary cut in VAT in Germany, whose price basket accounts for 28% of the total. 
In the U.K., meanwhile, consumer prices rose 0.4% on the month, rather than the 0.1% drop expected. 
In both the euro zone and the U.K. analysts say the July numbers are at odds with the longer-term trend, given the disinflationary forces created by rising unemployment and higher economic uncertainty. Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that the drag from lower energy prices was easing, ""but the truth is that we still don’t have a clear view of the underlying core inflation trend in (the euro zone).""
5 Oil calm as OPEC+ ministers review output deal
Oil ministers from most of the world’s biggest producers will gather virtually to review the state of the global market. 
The Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee convened by the so-called OPEC+ bloc, which starts at 10 AM ET, isn’t expected to recommend any major changes to production policy, given the relatively high degree of compliance with previously-agreed cuts in output.  
Elsewhere, the U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its weekly assessment of crude oil inventories. The American Petroleum Institute estimated on Tuesday that crude stocks fell by 4.29 million barrels, markedly more than the 2.9 million-barrel draw expected.
Despite that, U.S. crude futures still haven’t made headway beyond the $43 a barrel level. At 6:30 AM, they were down 0.9% at $42.69, while Brent futures were down 1% at $45.01 a barrel."

LONDON (Reuters) - Brexit safeguards to stop asset managers in Britain running ""shell"" investment funds in the European Union to retain access to its markets should be hardwired into EU law, the bloc's securities watchdog said on Wednesday.
After Britain voted in 2016 to leave the EU, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) issued guidance on minimum ""substance"" or senior boots on the ground at EU funds whose portfolio management has been ""delegated"" to London.
""Moreover, in light of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, delegation of portfolio management functions to non-EU entities is likely going to further increase,"" ESMA said in a letter to the bloc's financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis.
ESMA said there was merit in providing ""clearer legal drafting"" in the bloc's laws on substance and delegation requirements in line with its earlier Brexit guidance.
The EU may want to back up the ""qualitative"" criteria on substance with clear quantitative criteria, or provide a list of core or critical functions that may not be delegated at alternative and mutual funds, ESMA said.
A pending review of EU alternative fund rules that cover hedge funds and private equity funds was an opportunity to consider ""greater harmonisation"" with regulations governing mutual funds known as UCITS, ESMA said.
Alternative funds must report exposures to real estate and corporate debt to enable authorities to assess if they have enough liquidity in a market crisis.
ESMA said it was ""sub optimal"" that it does not have access to similar data on UCITS without extensive ad hoc data requests that slow down analysis.
ESMA is already checking on liquidity at UCITS.
""This assessment should be based on the analysis of how funds have reacted since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and their current situation, and on an estimation of their resilience to a future shock,"" ESMA said.

LONDON (Reuters) - United States-based Silicon Valley Bank (O:SIVB) is midway through hiring around 80 bankers in Britain, as it bucks the trend of peers who are shrinking during the coronavirus crisis.
The Santa Clara, California-headquartered lender is converting its London-based branch into a full subsidiary, as it bets on finding technology investment opportunities for private equity firms with piles of cash sitting on the sidelines.
""We are starting to see pockets of activity already, the influx of U.S. capital into UK tech had slowed since March but the phones are now ringing again and investors see it as a time to potentially start being opportunistic,” said Erin Platts, President of the UK branch of Silicon Valley Bank.
The bank has hired 30 staff in the first half of the year and is on track to increase its headcount in Britain from 250 at the start of 2020 to 330 by year-end, Platts said.
It will also hire a chairman and three directors to oversee the business.
British high street banking rivals are meanwhile laying off staff, as they attempt to cut costs as Britain heads into its worst economic recession in recent memory.
Silicon Valley Bank, which specialises in the tech sector and connecting venture funds with start-ups needing cash, aims to capitalise on the backlog of investment that built up since the coronavirus pandemic triggered lockdowns across Europe in March.
""Historic levels of fundraising by private equity means there is a lot of capital on the sidelines, much of it time-bound, and they need to invest,” Platts said.
Fundraising in the U.S. for tech investment has continued at a frenzied pace despite the pandemic, with over 100 special purpose acquisition companies currently hunting for fast-growing companies to buy, data from SPAC Research show.

1061,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 06:09AM ET</span>",Markets Tell the Fed It’s Finally Getting an Edge on Inflation,"(Bloomberg) -- The $20 trillion U.S. Treasury market is giving the Federal Reserve a thumbs-up for its efforts to revive inflation after the coronavirus pandemic threatened to inflict a damaging bout of deflation on the U.S. economy.
The best measure of that is inflation-adjusted interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds, which have plunged well below zero as nominal yields held fairly steady. Other signs of success include rising expectations for future prices among U.S. households.
Those are all signals that investors reckon some degree of inflation may be on the way, in part because Fed Chair Jerome Powell and colleagues slashed interest rates to almost zero and bought hundreds of billions of dollars of government bonds. Some even think price pressures could ultimately spiral out of hand, as ultra-easy monetary policy combines with fiscal stimulus after lawmakers authorized $3 trillion in spending and debate still more.
A surge in gold prices above $2,000 and ounce and a weakening dollar have also focused attention on the outlook for inflation. If investors are betting price increases will accelerate, the hope is that consumers and companies spend enough for that to happen, given inflation is still well below the Fed’s 2% target. That goal has never been reached on a sustained basis since it was adopted in 2012.
But Fed officials are more worried about the economy running out of steam than overheating. They’re warning Congress about the dangers of spending too little, not splurging too much.
There are already signs that the pickup in inflation pricing won’t continue to accelerate at the same pace, and that means the Fed is likely to keep monetary policy loose -- perhaps even looser than now -- for years to come in the belief it can adjust if inflation suddenly surges.
The market signals are “exactly what the Federal Open Market Committee should want to see to see at this juncture when inflation expectations are too low and policy space is limited,” Evercore ISI vice chairman Krishna Guha wrote in a note to clients.
Ten-year breakeven rates –- which combine the yields on standard and inflation-linked Treasuries into a measure of what bond markets expect consumer prices to do -- have jumped to about 1.69%, from as low as 0.47% in March.
Actual consumer prices rose 1% in July from a year ago, pushing core inflation to a four-month high of 1.6%. And consumer expectations for inflation in three years’ time increased to 2.73%, the most in more than a year.
‘Very Premature’
But economists generally saw the pickup as a reversal of distortions created by the virus lockdown, rather than a red flag. Fed Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren agreed.
“It is very premature to be concerned about a significant increase in inflation,” Rosengren told Bloomberg Television. He said it’s “critically important” for Congress to provide more fiscal support for the economy.
The White House and Democratic leaders are arguing over how much additional money is needed. Key parts of the government rescue effort, like extra unemployment benefits, have begun to expire –- a potential drag on demand, just as a resurgent virus sets back efforts to reopen the economy.
All these background risks explain why the Fed isn’t thinking about hitting the brakes at the first sign of higher prices.
In fact, the Fed’s soon-to-be-completed review may formally abandon the strategy of launching preemptive attacks against inflation –- and replace it with one that’s more tolerant when prices overshoot for a while, provided the 2% target is on track to be met over a longer period.
After Labor Day
While the Fed can get some results by rejigging its policy framework or telegraphing its intentions -- known as “forward guidance” in central-bank jargon -- it may eventually have to buy more bonds too.
The current monthly purchases of about $80 billion Treasuries have kept a lid on government borrowing costs -– and fed into the wider economy, where those yields are a benchmark. Mortgage applications have jumped.
But this month the market has shown signs of struggling to digest the record quantities of public debt issued to fund the pandemic rescue.
Ten-year nominal Treasuries are trading at around 0.67%, up 14 basis points from the end of July. Borrowing costs for homebuyers nudged higher too: Freddie Mac’s 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose to 2.96% in the week ended Aug. 13, from a record low of 2.88%.
Central banks have tried two main ways of using bond purchases to suppress long-term interest rates: Quantitative easing, which involves buying fixed volumes of debt. Or Japan-style yield-curve control, which means purchasing whatever amounts are needed to pin a chosen rate at a target level.
Fed officials are converging around forward guidance and asset purchases while they consider further questions about yield curve control. They are intent on keeping both short- and longer-term rates low, and are likely to provide strong signals to the market as their framework review concludes.
“I fear when we get back from Labor Day and get jobs data and retail sales, it could cast doubt on the recovery,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Financial Markets. “That’s when you’ll start to hear the Fed step up more and talk about YCC and QE.”

1062,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 05:40AM ET</span>","WTO goods trade index hits record low, detects some recovery signs","ZURICH (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization said on Wednesday its goods trade barometer hit a record low, suggesting global merchandise trade registered a historic fall in the second quarter of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic raged.
""Additional indicators point to partial upticks in world trade and output in the third quarter, but the strength of any such recovery remains highly uncertain: an L-shaped, rather than V-shaped, trajectory cannot be ruled out,"" the WTO said https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news20_e/wtoi_19aug20_e.htm on its website.
The barometer reading of 84.5 was down 18.6 points down from the year-ago period. In normal times, it anticipates changes in the trajectory of trade by a few months, but volatility triggered by the pandemic has reduced its predictive value.
""This reading – the lowest on record in data going back to 2007, and on par with the nadir of the 2008-09 financial crisis – is broadly consistent with WTO statistics issued in June, which estimated an 18.5% decline in merchandise trade in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period last year,"" the WTO said.
The exact extent of the fall will become clear only when official trade data for April to June become available.
The WTO had forecast in April that global trade in goods would fall between 13% and 32% in 2020 before rebounding by 21-24% in 2021, but in June said rapid responses by governments meant its pessimistic scenario for this year was unlikely.

""The WTO's June statistics implied a 14% drop in global merchandise trade volume between the first and second quarters of this year. This estimate, together with the new Goods Trade Barometer reading, suggest that world trade in 2020 is evolving in line with the less pessimistic of the two scenarios outlined in the WTO's April forecast,"" it said on Wednesday.

1063,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 02:25AM ET</span>",Column: Last of G7 real yields being harvested - Mike Dolan,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - Like over-ripe fruit of late summer, Italy's positive real long-term yields are some the last remaining in the world's major government bond markets, and they're being plucked fast.
Italy's sovereign borrowing premiums over German Bunds returned to pre-pandemic lows this week despite its soaring public debt. But while Italian bonds now possess the only positive 10-year real yields among Group of Seven economies - at just 0.3% this week - they are quickly heading towards zero.
Governments everywhere face mountainous new debt loads from the unresolved COVID-19 shock. Yet investors are betting major central banks will have to suppress long-term borrowing rates for governments and investment grade private firms for years to come to keep those debts affordable, and to keep credit flowing.
Unless central banks themselves disavow markets of that intention soon, all remaining real, or inflation-adjusted, yields will likely be snaffled away this year.
So with benchmark policy rates anchored near zero and long-term official bond buying in full flow, so-called safe bond yields have all but evaporated.
U.S. 10-year real yields plunged below zero in January - joining French, German and British equivalents that have spent much of the past decade in negative territory.
But U.S. Treasury real yields have continued to sink along with the others - plumbing depths below -1.0% this month - as investors bet central banks will sit on those rates long after there's a recovery and a re-emergence of inflation.

Super-charged bond buying programmes by the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank (ECB), Bank of Japan and Bank of England have much further to run and many expect they will be extended well beyond this year, even when the current plans expire.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) last week said it expected the ECB to use up its entire 1.35 trillion euro ($1.6 trillion) COVID-related bond buying programme, or PEPP, by the middle of next year and adopt an explicit 2% ""symmetric"" inflation target after its strategic review of policy goals in 2021.
The latter would allow inflation to move above 2% for a period, looking at averaging an inflation target over time. Even so, Deutsche economists reckon persistent spare capacity in the euro zone means inflation will still likely undershoot 2% over the forecast horizon and see no rate rises in that time.
What's more, it also expects the ECB to continue its pre-pandemic ""Asset Purchase Programme"" monthly net purchases, ""with the risks tilted towards an increase being necessary"".
Chiming with that view, big investors such as BlackRock (N:BLK) retain standing overweights on euro periphery government bonds, despite the steep fall in yields. ""We see further rate compression due to stepped-up quantitative easing by the European Central Bank and other policy actions,"" the giant U.S. asset manager said.
OUTLIER NO MORE?
Italy was the outlier for months due to its heavy debt-to-output ratio even before the pandemic, its severe hit from the virus early on and the peculiarities of the euro bloc that, once again, stoked fears this year's shock could undermine the single currency and raise doubts about Italy's membership over time.
But since those worries were lanced by last month's EU agreement on the 750 billion euro post-pandemic Recovery Fund - involving joint debt sales and fiscal transfers to the worst hit - Italian 10-year nominal yields have fallen to below 1% and the premium over Germany has now halved from the March peaks of 282 basis points to revisit pre-COVID-19 levels.
Both the scale of ECB bond buying and reduced pressure on new debt sales from expected recovery fund transfers and next month EU's unemployment support programme - on top of upcoming redemptions and reduced debt service costs - could have a huge impact on market dynamics going forward.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) calculates that ""a negative net supply technical will exist in Italy and Spain (as well as other periphery country bond markets) for the foreseeable future"" - with potential negative net issuance, excluding Treasury bills, of some 53 billion euros for 2021 as a whole.
As a result, real 10-year Italian yields have gone from as high as 2.3% in March to just 35 basis points - even though that's still juicy compared with -1% in the United States, Germany and France, zero in Japan and almost -3% in Britain.
Short of a resurgence of euro break-up fears, it's hard to see how positive real yields will remain anywhere for long given the aggressive central bank assumptions everywhere.
Many leading financiers, including EU-advocate George Soros, claim Italy remains a worry if its politics shifts further to the anti-EU right.
But in an interview last week Soros also said: ""I cannot imagine an EU without Italy.""

1064,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 02:16AM ET</span>","Taiwan to further free up economy, aiming to become Asian financial hub","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan will further liberalise its economy and offer more financing products, aiming to become an Asian financial and asset management hub, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Wednesday, pitching the island at a time of turmoil in next-door Hong Kong.
Export-dependent Taiwan, which already has a very open economy, is trying to diversify away from its traditional reliance on trade with China, its largest trading partner but also a political rival, with Beijing claiming democratic Taiwan as its own territory.
Instability in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, especially after Beijing enacted a new national security law there, has called into question how long the city can remain Asia's dominant financial centre.
While Taiwan is unlikely to supplant Hong Kong immediately, the government does hope to seize the opportunity to attract professionals and capital from the city.
Speaking to the Third Wednesday Club, a business group made up of 78 of Taiwan's most important companies including Foxconn (TW:2317), the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, Tsai made no direct mention of Hong Kong. 
However, she noted the growing interest in Taiwan from foreign companies.
""More and more internationally renowned companies, and even more international-level capital, talent and technology, are bullish about Taiwan, are coming to Taiwan and increasing their investment in Taiwan,"" she said.
""The government will continue to adopt even more open measures, open up diverse financial products, expand the scope of our wealth management business, and let Taiwan become an Asian corporate financing centre and high-level asset management centre.""
She gave no details.
Tsai also said the government would strive to sign more bilateral trade deals, including a long-mooted one with the United States, and reiterated her desire for Taiwan to join the 11-member Comprehensive and Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP.
Taiwan has only a limited number of international trade deals, with countries wary of signing such agreements lest they anger the world's second-largest economy China.

However Taiwan is a member of the World Trade Organization and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation bloc, and Tsai said Taiwan would seek to deepen its participation in both.

Twenty-eight traders and analysts out of 31 participants in the snap survey this week predicted no change to the one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR)  or the five-year tenor .
The remaining three respondents expected a marginal 5 basis point cut to both rates.
The one-year LPR is now 3.85% after two cuts this year, while the five-year rate is at 4.65%.
Market expectations for another rate hold were reinforced on Monday after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected more fresh liquidity through its medium-term lending facility (MLF), while keeping borrowing costs unchanged for the fourth straight month.
The MLF is one of the PBOC's main tools in managing longer-term liquidity in the banking system, and serves as a guide for the LPR. Any adjustment to the MLF should indicate a similar move to the LPR in the same month.
July activity data released last week suggested China's economic recovery remains on track but may have lost some momentum, with retail sales continuing to contract. But investment is picking up and infrastructure spending in particular is seen accelerating in coming months on the back of government support.
Still, considerable domestic and global uncertainties remain. Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura said the PBOC had no intention of tightening its monetary policy for the time being.
""We believe Beijing will continue its 'wait and see' approach by neither stepping up nor rolling back its existing policy easing measures,"" he said in a note.
""In the meantime, in the face of worsening international relations, Beijing's policy focus may turn increasingly inwards.""
China's top decision-making body said in late July that monetary policy would be more flexible and targeted and fiscal policy would be more proactive, prompting many market participants to believe that Beijing has shifted from its emergency stimulus mode to more targeted measures.
The LPR is a lending reference rate set monthly by 18 banks.

All 31 responses in the survey were collected from selected participants on a private messaging platform.

Australia, which accounts for less than 1% of the Philippines' poultry imports, has confirmed the outbreak at the egg farm in Victoria.
The ban covers poultry meat, day old chicks, eggs and semen, the Department of Agriculture said in its Aug. 14 order made public on Wednesday.
Avian flu can infect humans, although there is limited evidence of human-to-human transmission, according to health experts. Human infections are primarily acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments.
All incoming shipments from Australia with import clearance issued on or before Aug. 6 will be allowed entry, provided the birds were slaughtered or processed on or before July 3, or 21 days prior to the outbreak, Agriculture Secretary William Dar said.
The Philippines has seen its own outbreaks of avian flu, with the latest involving the highly infectious H5N6 subtype of the virus detected at an egg farm in San Luis town in Pampanga province in July.
The Southeast Asian country on Friday also declared a temporary ban on Brazilian poultry meat products, after two cities in China found traces of the new coronavirus in cargoes of imported frozen food, including chicken wings from the South American country.
Brazil has the world's second-worst COVID-19 outbreak after the United States, recording more than 3.4 million cases and deaths of close to 110,000 since the pandemic began.

1068,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 12:40AM ET</span>",No new U.S.-China trade talks scheduled: White House chief of staff,"By Andrea Shalal
ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - No new high-level trade talks have been scheduled between the United States and China but the two sides remain in touch about implementing a Phase 1 deal, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday.
U.S. President Donald Trump earlier told reporters during a visit to Yuma, Arizona, that he had postponed an Aug. 15 review of the trade agreement signed with China in January given his frustration over Beijing's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
""I postponed talks with China. You know why? I don’t want to deal with them now,"" Trump said during a briefing on construction of a border wall with Mexico. ""What China did to the world was not even thinkable. They could have stopped (the virus).""
Meadows said the review, mandated as part of the trade agreement with China, had not been rescheduled, but U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer remained in regular contact with his counterparts in China about fulfilling its commitments.
""There are no rescheduled talks ... at this point,"" Meadows told reporters.
""Ambassador Lighthizer continues to have discussions with his Chinese counterparts involving purchases and fulfilling their agreements.""
Trump struck a non-committal tone when asked if he would pull out of the trade deal with China, saying, ""We'll see what happens.""
During visits to Arizona and Iowa on Tuesday, Trump expressed frustration about China's handling of the health crisis and its failure to contain the disease, but he also lauded record purchases by Beijing of U.S. farm products. 
China's imports of U.S. farm and manufactured goods, energy and services are well behind the pace needed to meet a first-year target increase of $77 billion over 2017 purchases. But its purchases have increased as China's economy recovers from a coronavirus lockdown earlier this year.

On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the sale of 126,000 tonnes of soybeans to China, marking the eighth consecutive weekday with large sales to Chinese buyers. Crude oil sales have also increased.

The official, who discussed the matter on the condition of anonymity, said Tuesday night that both parties in Congress may be able to reach an accord on issues like financial help for the Postal Service, aid to schools and more money for businesses to keep their workers employed.
But the two parties remain far apart on other proposals, including stimulus checks and assistance for local and state governments, the official added.
The $500 billion figure is far less than congressional Democrats have demanded. The House approved a stimulus plan of about $3.5 trillion in May, but talks among Democratic congressional leaders and the White House ended in deadlock.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have said that they would be willing to drop their proposal to $2 trillion, and Pelosi suggested earlier Tuesday that Democrats could compromise even further now, then come back after the November elections with additional agenda items.
Senate Republicans plan to introduce their own scaled-back stimulus bill, which would include a $300 a week enhanced unemployment benefit, money for small business aid, additional Postal Service funding and protection for employers against lawsuits stemming from Covid-19 infections, an aide to the Senate GOP said Monday. That would be a slimmed-down version of a $1 trillion legislation Republican senators introduced in late July.
The administration official didn’t mention an enhanced unemployment benefit, which ran out at the end of July.
Both chambers of the Capitol are in recess. But Pelosi has called the House back into session for a vote on Saturday to provide $25 billion in aid for the Postal Service.

1070,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 08:35PM ET</span>",Some Japan firms rethink traditional office as pandemic boosts working from home: Reuters poll,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - A third of Japanese firms are reassessing using offices after a sharp drop in their utilisation in August from a year ago, as 65% of firms allowed or encouraged employees to work from home due to the coronavirus pandemic, a monthly Reuters poll showed.
Many workers in Japan, and elsewhere in the world, began telecommuting as the coronavirus spread and governments imposed restrictions on businesses and movements to contain it.
Some 62% of firms in the Reuters Corporate Survey said office utilisation fell 10-20% in early August from a year ago, while 25% said it had decreased 30-50% and 9% said it had more than halved over that period.
The survey showed firms were giving workers more flexibility during the pandemic and were starting to rethink the traditional office in a possible departure from the long hours and packed commutes that have come to symbolise Japan's strong work ethic.
""Reviewing office workspace would boost social benefits as a whole as it helps ease the commuters' ordeal and resolve office shortage,"" a manager of a paper and pulp maker wrote in the survey on condition of anonymity.
Until the start of 2020, there was growing demand for office space in Tokyo from firms seeking to expand or upgrade, but the vacancy rate has worsened for a fifth month running in July. 
The survey showed 33% of Japanese firms were reviewing or considering re-examining office utilisation. 
Out of those, 48% were considering establishing satellite offices - the most popular choice - while 33% were thinking about downsizing by cancelling leasing contracts and 10% were eyeing shared workspaces.
In July, IT solutions company Fujitsu Ltd unveiled a plan to halve its office space in three years, allowing flexible hours for roughly 80,000 workers - many of whom would work from home - under a ""new normal"".
The corporate survey, conducted for Reuters by Nikkei Research between Aug. 3-13, polled 495 big and midsize non-financial firms, with some 220 answering the questions.
The survey also showed firms resisted the concept of ""workation"" or telecommuting from resorts and rural areas, with nearly two-thirds of firms saying they were not considering it.
U.S.-CHINA TENSIONS
Asked about the souring relations between the United States and China, 46% of Japanese firms said U.S. sanctions against China would hit their profits.
Relations between the world's two largest economies have deteriorated sharply in recent months as they engage in a tit-for-tat round of sanctions over trade, Hong Kong and China's handling of the coronavirus.
One-fifth of Japanese firms said they were moving or considering shifting their businesses, operational bases and supply chains out of China, Japan's largest trading partner. 
A vast majority of those considering it would move operations to other parts of Asia, the survey showed.
Asked whether Japanese firms had been pressed to choose between U.S. and Chinese markets in the current context, an overwhelming majority of Japanese firms answered no.
If they were forced to choose, 62% said they would favour the U.S. market over China's.

""When considering profits solely, China is attractive. But there are many sources of concern such as information control,"" a ceramics maker manager wrote in the survey.

""We have to try to come to that agreement now,"" Pelosi said in an online interview with Politico. ""We're willing to cut our bill in half to meet the needs right now. We'll take it up again in January. We'll see them again in January. But for now, we can cut the bill in half.""
A senior House Democratic aide said Pelosi was reiterating a standing call by Democrats for the White House and Republicans to meet them ""half way"" on coronavirus relief. 
Pelosi also said she did not want to wait to reach a deal at the end of September, when Congress will need to agree on funding to keep the government open during the next federal fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. 
The Democratic-led House passed legislation with over $3 trillion in relief in May. Democrats offered this month to reduce that sum by $1 trillion, but the White House rejected it. 

The two sides remain about $2 trillion apart, with wide gaps on funding for schools, aid to state and local governments, and enhanced unemployment benefits.

1072,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 06:11PM ET</span>",New Canadian Finance Minister Freeland earned spurs in trade talks,"By Julie Gordon
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Chrystia Freeland, a former journalist who was Canada's lead negotiator for a new North American trade deal, was named the country's first female finance minister on Tuesday after the abrupt resignation of her predecessor, as the government shifted focus to the long-term economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
Freeland, 52, who is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's deputy and widely seen as his likely successor for leadership of the Liberal Party, was appointed after Bill Morneau stepped down as finance minister on Monday amid friction with the prime minister over spending policies. 
Prior to being appointed deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs in 2019, Freeland was Canada's foreign minister and minister for international trade. In that role, she renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement, now known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
While popular with business and trade groups, Freeland does not have the traditional corporate background of many of her predecessors in the finance portfolio, which could be viewed as a risk for markets as Canada grapples with a coronavirus-induced recession.
But her close ties to Trudeau combined with the government's focus on the coronavirus response and expected higher spending to boost the economic recovery will lead to few nasty surprises for markets, analysts said.
""At a time of uncertainty, it's the best choice for the role in the wake of Morneau's resignation,"" said Scotiabank economist Derek Holt, noting that Freeland was a financial markets policy wonk.
""She has international brand name recognition, she did well representing Canada against the protectionist U.S. administration in the trade talks. She's a good communicator.""
Prior to his exit, Morneau in July announced that Canada would post its largest deficit since the Great Depression amid billions in emergency aid spending in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
With the deficit already expected to top C$343.2 billion ($260.4 billion), Reuters reported on Sunday that Morneau had clashed with Trudeau over coronavirus-related spending and disagreed on the scope and scale of proposed green initiatives.
Freeland is seen as more willing to back up Trudeau's ambitions to use the crisis as an opportunity to push ambitious environmental spending to start weaning Canada's oil-dependent economy off fossil fuels.
""Ms. Freeland does have that record of being sort of a big thinker ... and interested in a big agenda,"" said Jonathan Malloy, a political science professor at Carleton University in Ottawa. ""The job of the finance minister is to be a bit skeptical of big spending programs and big new things. So, it’s going to be really interesting.""
ALBERTA ROOTS
In 2012, Freeland published her book 'Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else' highlighting how the wealthiest 0.1% of the population are amassing colossal fortunes on the backs of the masses. 
Before entering politics in 2013, she worked as a journalist and in senior editorial roles with several media companies, including the Financial Times, the Globe and Mail, and Reuters News.
Freeland grew up in Alberta and was tasked with quelling a growing sense of Western Canadian alienation after the 2019 election, when the Liberals failed to win a single seat in the oil-producing provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.
She has stood behind Trudeau in the face of numerous ethics investigations, including a recent scandal over his role in a government decision to appoint a charity with ties to his family to manage a multi-million dollar student grant program.

PG&E Corp (N:PCG), the state's biggest power company, told customers that rotating power outages were likely to occur on Tuesday afternoon and evening lasting about two hours.
On Friday and Saturday, the California ISO, which operates the grid for most of the state, ordered utilities to start outages that left over 400,000 homes and businesses sweltering for about an hour each as air conditioning demand outstripped available generation resources.
On Monday, the ISO told utilities to prepare for more outages but never issued the order because the weather moderated and consumers reduced the strain on the grid by using less power.
The last time the ISO imposed rotating outages was in 2001 when several energy companies manipulated the power market to cause prices to spike and electric supplies to run artificially short.
California power companies with outages over the weekend included units of PG&E, Edison International (N:EIX) and  Sempra Energy  (N:SRE).
Meteorologists at AccuWeather forecast high temperatures would reach the 90s Fahrenheit (35 Celsius) in some California cities through mid week. That is over 10 degrees F higher than normal.
The ISO forecast demand would reach 49,565 megawatts (MW) on Tuesday, which is just shy of the grid's all-time high of 50,270 MW in 2006, before sliding to 47,382 MW on Wednesday.
Power prices for Tuesday averaged record highs of $1,311 per megawatt hour (MWh) at the Palo Verde  hub in Arizona and $698 in SP-15  in Southern California, according to Refinitiv data going back to 2010.

The Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) said prices for Wednesday averaged $1,640/MWh at Palo Verde and $511 at SP-15.

The MTA is only the second muni bond market issuer to tap into the Fed's program, one of around a dozen emergency credit facilities launched by the central bank this year to help ease the blow from the coronavirus pandemic. The deal came a week after the Fed eased some credit terms for the MLF.
The mass transit agency, which has been hit hard by a sharp drop in ridership on its buses, subways and trains amid the pandemic, said it sold the bond anticipation notes at a true interest cost of 1.92%, saving more than 85 basis points.
The MTA said it initially offered the three-year notes in competitive bidding on Tuesday in the U.S. municipal market, receiving 20 bids from 10 banks, with an average clearing true interest cost of 2.79%.
So far, the Fed has reported that only Illinois, the lowest-rated U.S. state, had tapped the MLF for a $1.2 billion cashflow issue in June.
After complaints that MLF borrowing costs were too high, the Fed announced last week that it would lower the interest rate spread charged on loans issued by the facility by half a percentage point for each credit rating category.

The $500 billion short-term borrowing program was announced in April as a way for states and local governments to access cash as their revenue fell due to the pandemic. In June, it was expanded to include mass transit agencies.

The calculation is based on the employment rate for the 47 million parents with children under 12, assuming at least one parent has to stay off work to provide childcare, according to a Bloomberg Economics report. The estimate includes parents who have already left the workforce as well as those who are at risk of losing their jobs.
While the U.S. labor market has rebounded somewhat following unprecedented job losses in March and April, the pace of gains is slowing, and school closures will be another constraint on the economic recovery. In most states, schools haven’t opened for in-person classes, and those that have opened could close again if Covid-19 cases rise.
More than half of the 22 million jobs lost during the pandemic have not yet returned, according to Bloomberg Economics. Roughly 25 million parents are currently facing the choice between employment and family responsibilities, according to the report.
“Based on our estimates, progress may stall or even reverse as a result of the school closures and other virus-related disruptions,” Bloomberg economist Yelena Shulyatyeva said in the report. “Looking beyond the immediate pace of the recovery, this will have negative implications for long-term economic growth, living standards and equality.”
So-called shadow joblessness, defined as Americans who have stopped looking for work, spiked to 8 million at the peak of the pandemic, and remains 5 million above pre-crisis levels, according to Bloomberg Economics. School closures will continue to impact this number, especially the labor force participation rate for women, who generally take on a greater share of childcare obligations.

1080,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 08:36AM ET</span>",Small Argentine firms face 'terrifying' future even after debt deal,"By Eliana Raszewski and Marina Lammertyn
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Francisco Lurueña's textile firm on the outskirts of Buenos Aires has survived 39 years of myriad economic crises. Now it stands on the verge of closure, hit by COVID-19 on top of two years of recession, high inflation and a debt crisis.
His company, Rayvis SA, which has 18 employees and two plants that make acrylic threads, has seen sales tumble and has halted production for months, one of thousands of businesses that are sputtering just as Argentina sorely needs them to revive its economy.
""Right now is the worst moment in the company's history,"" Lurueña said. ""I don't know how much time we have. We have received help from friends, family. We are at the limit, practically on the verge of an absolute default.""
Argentina, fresh from clinching an agreement to restructure $65 billion foreign debt, needs firms like Rayvis to pay taxes so it can meet its new obligations to creditors and draw in much-needed investment to the country.
While the debt deal was key to stabilizing the economy, it will be in vain if Argentina cannot revive the growth needed to dig itself out of a deep fiscal hole and replenish emptied foreign reserves, creditors, analysts and officials said. 
""The government went into the pandemic with significant fiscal and monetary imbalances that effectively forced it to default on its local debt,"" said Patrick Esteruelas, head of research at EMSO Asset Management. ""Now they face an even bigger problem because of the post-COVID scar.""
In the first half of the year, 28,000 Argentine small businesses have gone under, despite government rescue efforts, data from the country's small and medium-sized business association shared with Reuters show, more in six months than in the previous four years combined. 
Many such firms, which account for around 70% of employment in Latin America's No. 3 economy, are falling into bankruptcy, according to a dozen company owners, workers and industry officials around Argentina.
""The (small- and medium-sized enterprises) that closed had already been enduring an economic crisis since last year - this year they had the chance to move forward or sink completely, and they ended up sinking,"" said Daniel Rosato, president of small and medium business industry association IPA. ""It was this pandemic that sealed their fate.""
Center-left Peronist President Alberto Fernandez has emphasized the role of smaller businesses in the post-pandemic recovery, and rolled out low-interest loans for firms and funding to help to pay salaries as part of a wider 1.4 trillion peso ($19.9 billion) aid package.
""The No. 1 goal of our administration for the post-pandemic will be jobs creation,"" Economy Minister Martin Guzman told Reuters, pointing to policies to boost demand and access to credit. 
'MONUMENTAL CRISIS'
COVID-19 has hit hard on Argentina's production and consumption heartland around the capital Buenos Aires, where lockdown measures have been in place since March 20. 
Sectors like hospitality, dining, clothing stores and construction have suffered the most.
Santiago Olivera, 43, said he had closed his restaurant 'Bad Toro' after being affected by the citywide lockdown, which still only allows food delivery.
""The reality is that hundreds of stores are closing every day,"" he said, adding he had initially borrowed to keep up with payments but eventually gave up.
""If we continued like that we were going to carry more and more debt and it was impossible to maintain rent, salaries, services, impossible to pay all that with the premises closed.""
State support has helped, but Rosato said accessing loans had become increasingly tricky for loss-making companies who had to prove they could repay. In some regions loan programs had also been suspended once lockdowns were lifted.
In oil-rich Neuquen province, some 1200 kilometers (745.65 miles) southwest of the capital, businesses from energy producers to retailers are also struggling, with tumbling oil prices compounding the impact of low domestic demand.
""You go down the street and before the pandemic there was one shop that was closed down per block due to the crisis, now there are three,"" said Daniel González, President of the Neuquén Chamber of Commerce.
He said emergency government subsidies that paid up to 50% of some salaries with a ceiling of 33,000 Argentine pesos ($451.44) had helped, but didn't nearly make up for the plunge in sales, while it was hard for companies ""already heavily in debt"" to borrow more. 
""I am concerned about the post-pandemic scenario, I think we are in a very complicated situation from which it will be very difficult to get out.""
The pandemic has also heaped further pressure on manufacturing sectors that had long been struggling in Argentina - from the low-volume electronics and appliance-making zone to its auto parts industry. The latter has seen 47 firms close since 2019, 30 of them this year, according AFAC, an auto parts industry association.
Only freezing workers' wages and cutting hours have avoided major layoffs in the appliances and electronics sector so far this year, said industry association head Federico Hellemeyer.
Federico Cuomo, who owns a company that distributes water coolers, described the mood among businesses as ""terrifying"".
""Most companies are debating how to survive,"" he said. 
The perfect storm of crises has left ""Argentina Inc"" in a weakened state, Argentina's former Economy Minister Ricardo López Murphy told Reuters. 
""If on top of this great fragility you receive a tremendous external shock then of course you will have a monumental crisis,"" he said.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1.15 trillion wealth fund expects more turmoil on financial markets as the world continues to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, a top fund official said on Tuesday, after it posted a 188-billion-crown loss ($21 billion) in the first half of 2020.
The pandemic is not under control ""in any shape or form"" and remains the biggest issue for investors, said deputy CEO Trond Grande, after presenting the half-year results of the world's largest sovereign wealth fund.
The fund lost $153 billion between January and March as markets plunged, its worst quarter ever, but earned back $131 billion from April to the end of June amid a rebound, its best quarter on record.
""We could be in for some turbulence this fall as things unfold and whether or not the coronavirus pandemic recedes, or gains some force,"" Grande told Reuters.
""We have already seen some sort of V-shaped recovery in the financial markets. I think there is a slight disconnect between the real economy and the financial markets,"" he said, noting that government support for economies could only be sustained for so long.
The full fallout for some sectors, such as leisure and travel, was yet to be seen, Grande said.
Founded in 1996, the fund holds stakes in around 9,200 companies globally, owning 1.5% of all listed stocks. It also invests in bonds and real estate. 
Its overall value is equivalent to approximately $214,000 for every man, woman and child in Norway.
The overall portfolio had a negative return of 3.4% in the first half of the year, with declines of 6.8% for equities and 1.6% for unlisted real estate, while the value of fixed-income holdings rose 5.1% as interest rates plunged. 
The overall return was 11 basis points lower than the return on the fund's benchmark index.
Oil companies were the weakest performers, with their stocks declining by 33.1% due to the slide in crude prices, while technology firms had the strongest development, gaining 14.2%.

At the company level, technology firms Amazon (O:AMZN), Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Apple (O:AAPL) contributed the most to the performance, while oil firm Shell (L:RDSa) and banks HSBC (L:HSBA) and  JP Morgan Chase  (N:JPM) performed the worst.

The pandemic risked the destruction of human capital not seen since the war so reconstruction should focus on the people who must pay off the unprecedented amount of debt amassed this year, Draghi said in a lecture in Rimini, Italy.
Moreover, even as Europe transforms it must recommit to some of its key principles, including multilateralism and the global rule of law, even as powers such as the United States and China question these principles, Draghi added.
""We should take inspiration from those who were involved in rebuilding the world, Europe and Italy after World War II,"" said Draghi, who has spoken rarely since leaving the ECB late last year.
""The debt created by the pandemic is unprecedented and will have to be repaid mainly by those who are young today,"" Draghi said. ""It is therefore our duty to equip them with the means to service that debt.""
Draghi said low rates did not automatically make debt sustainable and that the funds must be used for productive purposes, including investing in human capital, productive infrastructure and research.
He said spending should also reflect society's changing preferences, including towards environmental protection, better health care and digitalisation, since remote working was bound to gain prominence. 

""However, there is a sector which is critical for growth and therefore for all the transformations I have just listed, and where a long-term vision must be married with immediate action: education and, more generally, investment in young people,"" he said.

Investing.com -- The dollar hits a 28-month low against its peers as the GOP's latest stimulus package fails to excite. Gold creeps back above $2,000/oz.  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) earnings show how busy Americans have been during lockdown, while Walmart (NYSE:WMT) earnings are due later, along with housing starts data. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has reportedly joined the race for the U.S. operations of TikTok and the administration has cranked up the pressure on Huawei still further. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, August 18th.
1. Dollar hits 28-month low
The dollar slid to its lowest in over two years, amid expectations that the loss of fiscal support will slow the U.S. economy and force the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy again, further eroding its traditional yield premium over other reserve currencies.
By 6:25 AM ET (1025 GMT), the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six developed-market currencies, was down 0.4% at 92.493, having earlier hit a 28-month low of 92.457.
The dollar also slid to its lowest since January against the yuan, to trade at 6.9258 yuan on the official market and 6.9209 offshore.
The dollar’s weakness has revived the rally in gold and silver in recent days. Gold futures rose back above $2,000 an ounce overnight, while Silver, at $28.40 an ounce, is now up 20% in the last five days.
2. U.S. cranks up pressure on Huawei; Oracle eyes Tiktok
Shares in Asian semiconductor makers slid after the U.S. administration said it would extend sanctions against Huawei further.
Under a new rule announced by Washington on Monday, non-U.S. companies will need a special license to sell Huawei any chips made using U.S. technology. The rule extends even to widely available, mass-produced chips made by overseas firms, crimping Huawei’s ability to source components.
Meanwhile on another front of the U.S. campaign against Chinese tech, Bloomberg reported that Oracle is considering joining the race to buy the U.S. operations of video streaming service TikTok from its Chinese owner Bytedance.
3. Stocks set to edge higher at open
U.S. stocks are set to open fractionally higher, with none of the three major indexes really responding to the latest efforts by Senate Republicans to break the deadlock over a stalled stimulus package.
By 6:25 AM ET, the Dow 30 futures contract was up 76 points or 0.3%, while US 500 Futures were up 0.2%  and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.3%.
The day’s biggest earnings release will come before the open from Walmart. Home Depot has already got the ball rolling with a resounding 23% gain in comparable sales in the last three months that illustrate how lockdown measures have diverted more energy into home improvement. Adjusted earnings rose by a forecast-beating 27% from a year earlier.
Results are also due from Sea Ltd (NYSE:SE), the south-east Asian Internet platform operator which has been compared to Tencent and which has been on a hot streak ever since the pandemic swept across the world.
4. Housing starts, building permits data due
Home Depot’s earnings will sharpen appetites – in the absence of anything more substantial - for the latest news from the housing market, which is due at 8:30 AM ET.
The housing market has been a beacon of relative strength in recent weeks, with the National Association of Home Builders’ market index rising to match its highest level ever, amid a flurry of interesting from urbanites flocking to less densely populated suburbs.
Housing starts are expected to have posted a third straight monthly gain to 1.24 million in July, while building permits are expected to rise to 1.32 million.
5. Crude drifts off highs ahead of API data
The American Petroleum Institute will publish its estimate of last week’s movements in U.S. oil inventories at 4:30 PM, with analysts looking for a further drawdown of stocks that accumulated when demand collapsed in the second quarter.
Consensus forecasts for the government’s official data, due on Wednesday, indicate a draw of 2.48 million barrels. That would represent a fourth straight weekly draw, albeit the smallest draw of those four weeks.
The figures come a day ahead of a meeting of OPEC+ technical experts, which according to reports is unlikely to recommend any deviation from the planned path of output by the cartel and its allies.
By 6:30 AM, U.S. crude futures were down 0.3% at $42.78 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 0.1% at $45.71 a barrel."

Use of Zoom's video conferencing services has surged as huge numbers of people across the world work from home because of coronavirus curbs, but the company has also come under fire over privacy and security issues.
The Singapore data center, through which the company's users in Southeast Asia can connect, brings its total to 18 sites globally.
The company also plans to hire more Singapore employees, including engineers and sales staff, said Abe Smith, Head of International at Zoom.
Security researchers this year discovered that Zoom rerouted some calls through its servers in China, even if those calls were placed outside China. 
The company had said that this took place in ""extremely limited circumstances"" and it had taken its mainland China data centres off an approved list of back-ups for users outside China.
Zoom's Smith said there has been a 65-fold increase in users of its free services in Singapore, with a tripling of paying customers, since January. Since March, 400 schools in the city state have been using the platform.

Singapore briefly suspended the use of Zoom by teachers in April after ""very serious incidents"" in the first week of coronavirus lockdown, including an incident that involved obscene images appearing on screens during a geography lesson.

1085,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 05:27AM ET</span>","Trump Pledges Tax Credits, Tariffs to Redirect Jobs From China","(Bloomberg) --
President Donald Trump said he’ll punish American companies that move jobs abroad and reward firms with tax breaks for shifting work from China to the U.S., proposals aimed at hastening the decoupling of the world’s largest economies.
“We will create tax credits for companies that bring jobs from China back to America, and we’ll impose tariffs on companies that leave America to produce jobs overseas,” he said in a speech Monday in Minnesota.
With 11 weeks to go before his re-election bid, and with the unemployment rate at 10.2%, Trump is doubling-down on a message imploring domestic corporations to produce goods and services at home rather than in places like China where it’s less expensive.
“In Michigan, we have auto plants opening up left and right, and expanding,” Trump said. “They haven’t seen that in 42 years. We will end our reliance on China. We will make our critical drugs and supplies right here in the United States.”
Trump’s economic offensive against China has so far involved tariffs on its imports and restrictions on Chinese companies including Huawei Technologies Co. The pandemic, which Trump calls a “plague” wrought by China, has given fresh momentum to some Trump administration officials and members of Congress, who want to bring sprawling supply chains back to the U.S.
India, Taiwan and Japan have also offered fiscal incentives to entice companies to shift production out of China, or at least increase investment at home.

PILANESBERG NATIONAL PARK, South Africa (Reuters) - Wynand du Toit's safari camp in South Africa's Pilanesberg National Park lies abandoned, its tents ripped open by baboons and its survival in the balance after his insurer rejected his COVID-19 claim.
In the United States, Miami restaurant owner Luis Debayle has laid off two-thirds of his staff and is desperate for an insurance payout that could help avert the prospect of closure. 
Meanwhile, Munich beer garden boss Christian Vogler is heading to the German courts in an attempt to wrestle about 1 million euros ($1.2 million) from his insurer.
Businesses around the world, hamstrung by lockdowns, are facing often-existential showdowns with insurance companies that are reluctant to pay out on business interruption policy claims for a disaster unknown in living memory.
The insurers say many such policies exclude pandemics, require physical damage on premises or do not apply to the widespread lockdowns seen globally. Facing pressure from regulators, mounting reputational damage and a wave of lawsuits, they warn that paying out could sink their industry.
In some countries, including South Africa, France and Germany, insurers are now opening their chequebooks. But for many customers, these settlements or ex-gratia payments - voluntary payouts that do not imply legal liability - fall short.
Du Toit's interim relief payment amounted to 11% of his roughly 3 million rand ($172,000) claim and was spent in a matter of hours. A bigger payout could hinge on a case being pursued in court against the insurer by another business, which could take some time to resolve. 
His company, including three tented safari camps and 19 staff, was thrown a lifeline when South Africa opened provincial borders for all travel on Tuesday. 
However with about 2 million rand in debts still to pay, demand uncertain and an ongoing ban on international tourism, which made up 70% of pre-pandemic revenues, it is going to be tough to stay afloat without a full payout. 
""Make no mistake, I am grateful,"" said du Toit, but added that he needs his claim honoured in full. 
""That will literally wipe out all of these past five months' of debt,"" he said of a full payout. ""It's going to be a heavy burden to try and survive with that.""
Du Toit's insurer, Santam, declined to comment. 
South African insurers argue their policies were designed to cover closures following an outbreak of disease to allow mitigation measures such as deep cleaning, but not national lockdowns. They say the payments on offer are their attempt to do right by clients. 
""The interim relief measures are there to assist policyholders as much as the individual insurers can, pending the legal certainty process,"" said Viviene Pearson, head of the South African Insurance Association. 
FACING CLOSURE
In France, some cooperative banks and mutual insurers have offered small firms a ""stimulus bonus"" or ""health-crisis allowance"", ex-gratia payments of in some cases up to 20,000 euros. 
The German state of Bavaria has negotiated a settlement offer that would see insurers pay 15% of companies' claims for up to 30 days of interrupted operations. Allianz (DE:ALVG), one of the country's biggest insurers, says it will extend the offer to all German clients. 
But many hoteliers and restaurants have balked at the proposal.
Vogler, who runs one of the biggest beer gardens in Munich, is suing his insurer instead, dismissing the settlement offer as a ""joke"".
His insurer, Bayerische Versicherungskammer, declined to comment on his case but said more than 80% of clients in the restaurant and hotel industry had agreed to the offer. 
Some insurers have yet to pay at all. Businesses in Britain and Australia have been left with nothing pending the outcome of legal test cases aiming to clarify whether insurers are liable. 
The possibility of a similar test case in South Africa is under consideration. 
U.S. insurers have also resisted, pushing businesses to take them to court. 
One such plaintiff is Debayle, owner of two Nicaraguan restaurants in Miami, who is still making operational losses.
""We have enough liquidity to continue through 2020, but if the situation goes well into 2021, then I could see permanently closing as a real possibility.""
U.S. judges have already ruled in favour of insurers in some cases. 
'PAY-BACK TIME'
Globally, insurers say they are paying out on legitimate claims, but their policies were not designed to cover the pandemic's cataclysmic fallout. 
UBS has estimated the industry could be on the hook for non-U.S. business interruption losses totalling between $7 billion and $22 billion. 
But in the second quarter, the coronavirus dealt a relatively modest $2.5 billion blow to five insurers with large U.S. operations.
The virus has prompted many insurers to pull back on writing new coverage, to toughen terms and raise premiums. Some have removed pandemics from their coverage and called for state backing for such policies in the future.
In South Africa, du Toit's staff, including 21-year-old Thomas Mthisi, finish their maintenance work as impalas graze in the car park. Mthisi's now set to return to work in October, after months of relying on food parcels from his church to help feed his family. 
Now is no time for insurers to abandon customers who have dutifully paid their premiums for years, he said. 

""This is pay-back time.""

Thirteen out of 15 institutions surveyed expect the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to leave the interest rate on its overnight reverse repurchase facility  steady at a record-low 2.25%. 
The two dissenters predicted a fifth cut, possibly by as much as 50 basis points, to breathe life into the country's economy, which suffered its first recession in 29 years in the second quarter.
""We expect the BSP to keep its policy rate steady for now, preserving its next rate cut for any signs of further economic activity deterioration,"" HSBC said in a note.
The BSP has been one of the most aggressive central banks globally in policy easing, slashing its key rate by 175 bps cumulatively this year, to reduce the pandemic's economic damage.
Some economists expect the BSP to resume cutting the reserve requirement ratio to encourage banks to continue lending to support the economy. 
With July inflation at a six-month high of 2.7%, BSP Governor Benjamin Diokno last week hinted the policy rate could remain unchanged for the rest of the year.
But a worsening spread of the coronavirus in the Philippines, which leads in the number of infections in Southeast Asia at close to 170,000 cases, could be a game-changer.
President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday eased a strict lockdown in and around the capital to allow more businesses to reopen, despite warnings from experts that lifting the curbs could lead to a rise in COVID-19 cases.

Capital Economics economist Alex Holmes has pencilled a 50 bps cut before the year ends to make up for ""lacklustre"" fiscal support from the government.

An unbalanced recovery, weak private demand and excessive market optimism have combined to drive real rates up, increasing debt-servicing burdens even as financial conditions tighten, S&P economists Shaun Roache and Vishrut Rana said in a report.
""A climb in real interest rates may throw China's recovery off course just as it should be gathering steam,"" they said.
Recent datapoints including robust industrial production and surging exports have contributed to hopes for a sustained recovery in the world's second-largest economy.
But Roache and Rana said those have relied on ""extraordinary policy support"" and that consumer activity, the service sector and private firms were lagging.
Furthermore, despite a pickup in headline consumer inflation figures, core inflation remains persistently low, rising 0.5% in July, and producer prices have continued to fall.
Against that backdrop, an equities rally and a flood of new government bond issuance has pushed yields on benchmark bonds higher, lifting corporate yields. 
Benchmark Chinese 10-year government bonds yielded 2.9432% on Tuesday, up from a late-April low of around 2.5%. (CN10YT=RR) 
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has avoided broad easing measures in tackling the economic effects of the pandemic, and a bank adviser recently said it does not need to step up policy easing as a recovery is well under way.
In fact, Roache and Rana said a recent rise in short-term repo rates indicated that policy-makers ""are comfortable pulling back some monetary stimulus"".
On Monday, the PBOC again kept rates on one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans unchanged ahead of the publishing of the benchmark loan prime rate (LPR) on Thursday. 
Analysts do not expect the LPR, published monthly based on assessments from 18 banks, to change this month.
Roache and Rana noted a 30 basis point fall in the LPR since the beginning of 2020 and a 100 basis point drop in core inflation meant the real LPR interest rate had risen by 70 basis points.

""Until China's consumers start spending and private firms pick up investment, it's too early to say the recovery is self-sustaining and can live with much less stimulus, including higher real interest rates,"" they said.

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 03:30AM ET</span>",Japan's low jobless rate masks deepening worker despair,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Hiroko Hamada
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's low unemployment rate on paper suggests an economy weathering the coronavirus reasonably well, but official figures belie worsening prospects for the country's army of temporary workers, who make up about 40% of the jobs market.
A rise in job losses would undermine one of the few successes of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies, aimed at reviving the economy.
Japan's jobless rate stood at 2.8% in June, much lower than 10.2% in the United States and 7.8% in the 19-member euro zone.
But a close look at data shows a rising number of people dropping out of the jobs race. That prevents the official jobless rate - the ratio of job seekers who are yet to land work - from rising much.
About 2.4 million furloughed workers are kept on payrolls backed by state subsidies, which the government is seeking to extend beyond its end-September expiration.
""The huge number of furloughed workers suggests companies are saddled with excess labour and are under pressure to cut jobs down the road,"" said Hisashi Yamada, senior economist at Japan Research Institute.
""Job losses will hurt Japan's economic recovery as they spread to broader sectors in coming years, eroding households' purchasing power,"" he said.
Japan's economy plunged by a record pace in the second quarter as the pandemic hit consumption and exports.
In the jobs market, the pain has been felt most by those categorised as ""non-regular workers,"" including those with low-paying, part-time jobs, who make up 38% of all employees in Japan.
Non-regular workers account for roughly three quarters of those employed by restaurants and hotels, many of which were hit hard by the pandemic, according to the labour ministry.
A government survey showed more than 40,000 workers, about 15,000 of whom are non-regular workers, have been laid off since February.
One worker in her 20s, who was employed as temp staff at a call centre in Kanagawa prefecture, quit her job in June.""My employer would not allow us non-regular workers to work from home,"" she told Reuters, on condition of anonymity. ""I was told that I could take time off but would not be paid, so I quit, thinking it'd be better living on unemployment insurance.""
Some economists estimate the jobless rate would be closer to 4% if furloughed workers were included in the official figures.
More broadly, the downturn has affected both those at the start and end of their careers.
Over 100 university and high-school students had their job offers cancelled, about triple the number for 2019. More than 50 listed firms offered early retirement to let go some 9,300 employees, the fastest pace in eight years, separate data found.
Some analysts expect Japan's official jobless rate to rise to a record 5.5% hit during the 2009 global financial crisis.
That is a high level in Japan, where labour unions have historically accepted low wage offers to protect jobs - keeping the jobless rate low compared with other countries.
However, Nobuyuki Sato, chairman of a Japanese-style hotel inn in Yamagata prefecture, said an end to government subsidies could force his company to start cutting jobs.

""Labour costs are a major burden to Japanese-style inns like us, as they account for 30% of overall costs,"" he told Reuters.

Politico reported https://politi.co/2E5GqQS on Sunday that Pentagon officials working on Defense Secretary Mark Esper's cost-cutting review of the U.S. Defense Department had proposed slashing military healthcare by $2.2 billion. 
""A proposal by Pentagon officials to slash Military Healthcare by $2.2 billion dollars has been firmly and totally rejected by me. We will do nothing to hurt our great Military professionals & heroes as long as I am your President,"" Trump said in a tweet https:// 
The cut proposed to the military health system over the next five years came as part of an effort by Esper that started last year with the goal of eliminating inefficiencies within the Pentagon's coffers, Politico reported. 
Politico also said, however, that senior defense officials had argued that such cuts would have hurt the healthcare of millions of military personnel and their families amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. 
About 9.5 million active-duty personnel, military retirees and their dependents rely on the military health system. The military's government-run healthcare network operates hundreds of facilities around the world. 

Reuters reported last week that Trump had privately discussed with advisers the possibility of replacing Esper after the November election following a growing number of differences between them.

The median forecast from the poll of 13 economists was for export orders to rise 3.7% from the same period last year. Forecasts ranged from a growth of 0.4% to 7%.
Orders in June jumped 6.5% from a year earlier, their fastest pace in nearly two years, boosted by strong demand for telecommuting products such as laptops, as the COVID-19 pandemic forced millions of people around the world to work from home.

Taiwan's export orders are a leading indicator of demand for Asia's exports and for hi-tech gadgets, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.

1094,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 11:10PM ET</span>","U.S., Colombia to bring $5 billion in investment to rural areas","BOGOTA (Reuters) - The United States and Colombia will work together to bring new investment to rural areas of the South American country, officials said on Monday, as Colombia's president reiterated support for the U.S. candidate to lead the Inter-American Development Bank.
The investment initiative will harness up to $5 billion in private funds for rural areas over three years, U.S. National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien told local newspaper El Tiempo in an interview.
""This initiative will focus on key elements of the 21st-century growth in Colombia, the rule of law, security, infrastructure, rural development and democracy,"" O'Brien said in a joint video statement with Ivan Duque.
Colombia will be part of a pilot program meant to incentivize near-shoring of U.S. businesses, part of a larger U.S. strategy announced on Monday.
Mauricio Claver-Carone, special adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump for the Western Hemisphere, was also on the visit.
Duque repeated Colombia's support for Claver-Carone in his bid to lead the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), which is set to choose a new head next month. 
Haiti and El Salvador on Monday joined Guyana in co-nominating Claver-Carone as their own candidates.
But several other Latin American countries have called for a vote delay, citing concerns over having an IDB leader from outside the region.
""I want to reaffirm the support Colombia has given to the candidacy of Mauricio Claver,"" Duque said. ""You have presented a clear agenda to invigorate the recovery of Latin American economies.""
The United States unveiled a Western Hemisphere strategy on Monday focused on security, economic growth and countering China's influence in the region.
The strategy aims to encourage U.S. companies to move manufacturing facilities and supply chains out of China and back to the Americas, a U.S. National Security Council official said.
The strategy also vows to maintain maximum pressure on rulers in Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua.

The trip comes as Trump seeks to build support for his re-election campaign as Democrat Joe Biden leads in national polls. The Trump re-election campaign this year increased its outreach to Latinos.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The agency running California's power grid warned that millions of homes could be hit by rolling blackouts imposed on Monday to manage overwhelming energy demands caused by an extreme heat wave baking the state for a fourth straight day.
Officials for the California Independent System Operator estimated that peak electricity consumption on Monday would likely exceed available supply statewide by as much as 4,400 megawatts - roughly equivalent to the amount of power needed by 3.3 million homes.
A lapse of that magnitude would mark the most severe shortfall to strike California's grid since 2001, the last time utilities in the state essentially rationed energy in the form of rolling blackouts, said Ralph Cavanagh, energy co-director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.
The controlled power disruptions, with alternating blocks of utility customers losing electricity for one or two hours at a time, are designed to prevent excess demand from triggering a more widespread collapse of the grid that could last days.
An earlier round of rotating outages this weekend affected around 408,000 customers of four utilities across California, more than half of them served by Pacific Gas and Electric Company (N:PCG).
Stephen Berberich, president and CEO of the Independent System Operator, told reporters on a conference call that Monday's blackouts could run from late afternoon to late evening.
The full extent of outages is a moving target that hinges largely on how much energy customers might conserve during the day as part of a Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) Alert declared by the agency on Sunday, urging consumers to voluntarily scale back electricity use.
The latest power crunch follows a series of large-scale shutdowns imposed by PG&E and other utilities during wind storms last fall as a precaution against wildfires being sparked by downed transmission lines. Large swaths of the state's power grid were de-energized for days during those shutoffs.
The current heat wave, which has roasted parts of Southern California in triple-digit temperatures since Friday, was attributed to an enormous high-pressure system over much of the Western United States, and was expected last through Wednesday.
The hottest air temperature recorded anywhere on the planet in at least a century, and possibly ever, was reached in Death Valley in California's Mojave Desert on Sunday afternoon, where it soared to 130 Fahrenheit (54.4 Celsius).
The state's power grid was also pushed to its limits over the weekend by sporadic winds that disrupted wind farm power generation and the system failure of a key natural gas power plant, officials said.

Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday ordered an investigation into the blackouts and signed an emergency proclamation seeking to free up excess energy capacity. (https://

1096,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 10:55PM ET</span>",Canada finance minister resigns amid friction with Trudeau and charity scandal,"By Steve Scherer and Julie Gordon
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's finance minister resigned on Monday amid friction with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over spending policies and after coming under fire for his ties to a charity tapped to run a student grant program.
Bill Morneau said he would not run for parliament again and would instead seek to become the next secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Just last week, Trudeau had expressed confidence in his finance minister as rumors swirled of a rift between the two men. Morneau, 57, has been in the job since Trudeau's Liberals took power in 2015. 
""This morning I went to the prime minister and I tendered my resignation,"" Morneau told reporters at a hastily arranged news conference on Monday evening. 
""It's appropriate that the prime minister find someone with a longer term approach for the role, since I'm not running for office,"" he added.
Morneau's Toronto seat, a mix of low-income flats and million dollar homes that the party has held since 1993, is unlikely to be at risk for the Liberals, who have a minority government. 
One front-runner to replace Morneau is Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, a close Trudeau ally, who has held several high-profile cabinet roles. 
Morneau and his team have pushed back against other cabinet ministers about how much pandemic funding was needed, including to what extent the post-lockdown recovery could be helped by investing in environmental projects, sources told Reuters on Sunday.
    Trudeau, who campaigned on a platform to tackle climate change, believes the 2021 budget should have an ambitious environmental element to start weaning the heavily oil-dependent economy off fossil fuels and he recently hired former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney as an informal adviser, aides say.
Canada's budget deficit is forecast to hit C$343.2 billion ($253.4 billion), the largest shortfall since World War Two, this fiscal year. Total coronavirus support is nearly 14% of gross domestic product.
BMO Chief Economist Doug Porter said a policy shift was unlikely under Morneau's replacement given that ""fiscal policy has been already pretty much running at full throttle"".
""There has been the widespread perception that, ultimately, the policy thrust was being driven by the PM's office,"" he wrote in a research note. 
'CONSUMED BY SCANDAL'
The Canadian dollar showed little reaction to the news.
""We had a little bit of a sell-the-rumour type weakness in the lead up to the resignation,"" said Ray Attrill, head of forex strategy at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Sydney. ""There doesn’t seem to be any suggestion at this stage that this any broader implications for the Canadian government.""
Other possible replacements for the key post include Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne and President of Canada's Treasury Board Jean-Yves Duclos. 
In a statement, Trudeau thanked Morneau for his service over the past five years and said he would ""vigorously support"" Morneau's bid to head the OECD.
OECD nominations are due by October. The United States plans to nominate deputy White House chief of staff Christopher Liddell for the secretary general job, a senior U.S. official said last month. 
Adding to Morneau's challenges, several cabinet members were upset when he disclosed he had forgotten to repay travel expenses covered for him by a charity at the heart of an ethics probe. Morneau and Trudeau are both facing ethics inquiries related to the charity.
Morneau's resignation ""is further proof of a government in chaos,"" Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer said on Twitter, adding the ""government is so consumed by scandal that Trudeau has amputated his right hand to try and save himself.""
The clash reflected concerns among business leaders that Ottawa had little apparent interest in the economy, sources told Reuters.
Business and analysts have also fretted about Ottawa becoming distracted by the discord as it tackles the coronavirus crisis.
""I doubt you'll be seeing other finance ministers around the world step down at this time of elevated economic and fiscal uncertainty,"" said David Rosenberg, chief economist at Rosenberg Research & Associates. 

""It's like a boxer being forced to take his gloves off in the fifth round.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's rise to power in 2012 ushered in bold policies known as ""Abenomics"" that helped revive the economy and boost corporate profits, exports and jobs.
However, the record plunge in Japan's economy in the second quarter due to the coronavirus has wiped many of the gains of those policies, dealing a political blow to Abe a year before his term as head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) ends.
Japan's real gross domestic product (GDP) hit almost 540 trillion yen ($5.09 trillion) in September last year, but then began to slide as the U.S.-China trade war and a sales tax hike hit exports and consumption.
The pandemic has since knocked real GDP to 485 trillion yen, its lowest since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

For a graphic on Japan's economy posted a record drop in second-quarter: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/yzdpxnmewpx/eikon.png
To deal with the pandemic hit, Abe's government has deployed combined stimulus spending worth $2.2 trillion, almost half the size of the economy.
That boosted budget spending and added to Japan's ballooning public debt, already the biggest among advanced economies.

Abe considers strong jobs growth as one of the successes of his policies, which he attributes to strong economic growth although a dwindling working-age population has also kept the jobs market tight.
Japan's jobless rate stood at a 27-year low of 2.2% in December last year, a little over half the rate when Abe took power in 2012, although the pandemic has since nudged it up.

Despite years of heavy money printing by the Bank of Japan, inflation had failed to accelerate toward its 2% target, peaking at 1.4% in 2014 after which oil prices slumped.
The pandemic is now stoking fears of deflation as weak household spending depresses prices.

The BOJ's years of money printing have expanded its balance sheet dramatically, which has drained market liquidity.
While the pace of asset purchases has slowed in recent years, the pandemic has forced the BOJ to reopen the monetary spigot.
Critics warn the BOJ's oversized balance sheet would make any exit nearly impossible without causing market disruptions.

U.S. President Donald Trump's nomination of Claver-Carone has sparked controversy in the region and in the U.S. Congress because he would be the first person from outside the region to head Latin America's main development bank.
Claver-Carone, the son of Cuban immigrants, has garnered the support of 17 of the bank's 28 member countries, but Argentina, Mexico, Costa Rica and Chile, and a top EU official have all urged a delay in the Sept. 12 vote.
If some European countries join them, the four countries could thwart a vote. They control 22% of the vote and a quorum of at least 75% of the bank's voting shares must be present for the election to proceed.
U.S. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Monday said he was deeply concerned about Trump's nomination of Claver-Carone for the five-year term shortly before the Nov. 3 presidential election.
He called the nomination ""a breach of precedent that would lock in place for half a decade someone who is potentially out of step with the next administration and would threaten the IDB’s governance and effectiveness moving forward.”
Claver-Carone last week told Reuters that he could still serve if Trump loses the election, and warned that any move by a minority of shareholders to delay the election could jeopardize the bank's ability to raise funds in the future.
Colombian President Ivan Duque on Monday repeated his support for Claver-Carone in Bogota, as U.S. officials announced a joint initiative with Colombia that will bring $5 billion in private investments to a rural area.

1100,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 07:27PM ET</span>",Republicans Plan Scaled-Back Proposal for Virus Relief Bill,"(Bloomberg) -- Senate Republicans plan to introduce a scaled-back stimulus bill amid the standoff over a new virus relief plan that’s dragged on for weeks, according to two Senate Republican aides.
The legislation would include a $300 a week enhanced unemployment benefit, money for small business aid, additional U.S. Postal Service funding and protection for employers against lawsuits stemming from Covid-19 infections, according to the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plan isn’t public.
The proposal would represent a slimmed-down version of the $1 trillion legislation GOP senators introduced at the end of July as a counter-point to the $3.5 trillion plan Democrats passed in the House in May.
The plan was reported earlier by Politico.
There were no immediate signs that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would call senators back from their August break to vote on it. Any legislation would need to get at least some Democratic support to get through the Senate, and that now is unlikely. The proposal also could serve as the latest Republican offer in talks on a new stimulus, which may not resume until September.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer have offered to trim their proposal by $1 trillion, but repeated rejected any smaller stimulus or doing a virus relief package piecemeal.
With just 78 days until the general election, the President Donald Trump’s White House and congressional Republicans have been in a deadlock with Democrats over bolstering the U.S. economy with millions of people still out of work and many businesses struggling with pandemic-induced shutdowns.
That is despite warnings from Federal Reserve officials, economists, governors and mayors that, with much of the earlier stimulus exhausted, the risk to the economy grows every day that goes by without a deal.
McConnell said earlier Monday at a news conference in Kentucky that he still hopes they can cut a deal with Democrats, but didn’t offer any guarantees.
“I can’t tell you with certainty we’re going to reach an agreement,” he said.

1101,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>",Macau VIP casino industry out of luck as China cracks down on capital flows,"By Farah Master
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's move to stamp out online gambling to help contain capital outflows is hitting liquidity in Macau's VIP segment, at a time when the world’s No. 1 gambling hub is hobbled by slowing economic growth, Sino-U.S. tensions and coronavirus lockdowns. 
In June, Beijing identified the cross-border flow of funds for gambling as a national security risk.
Since then, financing channels used by the online gambling sector and cryptocurrency lending platforms have been cut off, with tens of thousands of suspects arrested.
Authorities have frozen thousands of bank accounts and seized more than 229 billion yuan ($32.95 billion), according to government statements, while illegal gambling rings across the country have been purged on a near weekly basis.
Casino executives and junket operators in Macau, a special administrative region where casino gambling is legal, say the crackdown is hitting big spending VIP customers due to worries over their financing channels via the junkets.
“It definitely impacts liquidity,” said Lam Kai Kuong, director of the Macau Junket Association, adding the VIP industry may never return to revenue levels hit two years ago unless China stops its suppression of VIP gambling.
Gambling is illegal on the mainland and junkets operate in a grey area, luring big spending gamblers with luxury perks and lines of credit, often using underground banking networks and payment channels.
The VIP junket sector in the former Portuguese colony accounts for almost 50% of overall revenues, which hit $36.5 billion last year. 
While many top junkets are not directly involved in online gambling, agents under them use these channels to settle debts and provide credit for high rollers.
""The junket sector in Macau has been living on borrowed time for years, and the end is drawing nearer,"" says Anthony Lawrance, managing director of Greater Bay Insight, a consultancy. 
""China clearly intends to cut out these middlemen and gain better control over the outflows of renminbi (yuan) through Macau.”
JUNKET RUN
Macau junket executives said while China was not targeting the Macau casino industry itself, the focus on money laundering and illegal transactions put pressure on liquidity.
The crackdown prompted some speculation that Asia’s top junket operator, Suncity, had been targeted by authorities last month. 
The speculation saw around 900 players withdraw deposits from Suncity’s VIP clubs across casinos in Macau between July 9-11, according to an internal email sent among operators.
Macau’s police and gaming regulator were advised of the withdrawals, the notice said, while photographs on Wechat showed dozens of investors lining up outside Macau’s luxury parlours to withdraw cash amid fears it would be seized by authorities.
Following the withdrawals, Suncity’s Chairman Alvin Chau spoke in rare detail about the company’s financials in a seven minute online video, denying the company had been targeted and saying it had enough cash to cover bad debts and deposits for its customers.
Macau’s gaming regulator told Reuters last week it was paying close attention to the matter although so far it had not seen any “irregularities” concerning Suncity’s business. 
Separately, in a notice to customers and reviewed by Reuters, junket AG Asia Entertainment, which targets Chinese gamblers via online operations in the Philippines, said it was ceasing operations and asked them to withdraw deposits before Aug. 12.
The crackdown comes as casinos struggle with a dearth of travellers due to coronavirus restrictions. 
China has announced the resumption of Macau tourist visas for nationals from Sept. 23.
Ben Lee, founder of Macau gaming consultancy IGamiX said even if there was demand from high rollers to come to Macau, the ability of the junkets to finance gaming activity remains severely constrained and would put further onus on casino operators. 

“The only way for the VIP segment to recover is for the casinos to expand their lines of credit without corresponding cash collateral (from the junkets) which has been a prerequisite for them in the past.”  ($1 = 6.9501 Chinese yuan renminbi)

MANKATO, Minn./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday vowed to create 10 million jobs in 10 months, in part by setting up tax credits for U.S. companies that relocate manufacturing facilities to the United States from China.
Trump, seeking to build support ahead of the Nov. 3 election, told supporters during a visit to Mankato, Minnesota, his administration would also strip federal contracts from companies that outsourced work to China.
""We will create tax credits for companies that bring jobs from China back to America,"" Trump said during an hourlong speech. He also predicted the U.S. economy would bounce back strongly from the economic shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic - as long as he was re-elected.
""What we're doing together is nothing short of an economic miracle and now we're doing it again,"" Trump told cheering supporters. ""We built the greatest economy in the history of the world and now I have to do it again.""
Trump hailed increased retail sales in recent months. But data released last week showed U.S. retail sales increased less than expected in July as consumers cut back on purchases of motor vehicles. They could slow further in the months ahead amid spiraling new COVID-19 infections and a cut in unemployment benefit checks.
The Trump administration is taking action on multiple fronts to rebalance U.S. economic ties with China, including through restrictions on Chinese firms like technology giant Huawei, bans on popular apps like TikTok, and a spate of executive orders aimed at ensuring domestic production of key products.
At the time, the administration is using ""Buy America"" requirements and incentives to persuade U.S. firms to bolster domestic supply chains, especially for critical supplies, such as drugs and medical equipment.
The Republican president, who is trailing Democrat Joe Biden in the polls, said his tax cuts and other measures were strengthening the U.S. economy despite the pandemic.
He said the administration planned further tax cuts, and reductions in regulations to encourage more investment at home, but gave no specific details.

""We will end our reliance on China, we will make our critical drugs and supplies right here in the United States,"" he said, in an apparent reference to an executive order signed last month to boost production of medicines and medical equipment.

TEL AVIV/DUBAI (Reuters) - From a proposed rail link to the Gulf from the Israeli port of Haifa, to quick-hop direct flights from Tel Aviv, the prospect of formal relations with the United Arab Emirates is stirring excitement in Israel.
In the UAE, which Israeli business executives with foreign passports have visited for years, companies that are likely candidates for above-board deal-making with Israel are taking a more cautious line, apparently awaiting government guidance on future policy.
Israel and the Gulf State announced on Thursday they would normalise relations under a U.S.-sponsored deal that still awaits negotiations on details such as opening embassies and travel links before it is officially signed.
Israeli officials have been quick to play up the economic benefits of the accord, which once formalised would also include agreements on tourism, technology, energy, healthcare and security, among other areas.
Some Israeli and Emirati businesses have already signed deals since Thursday, and several small-scale medical and defence collaborations were announced in the weeks preceding the normalisation agreement.
But Emirati state entities and private businesses have been circumspect in discussing investment opportunities before ties are official, with many declining to comment.
Conglomerate Al Habtoor Group, which has several hotels in Dubai, is in talks to partner with Israeli carrier Israir, a spokeswoman said, declining to provide further details. It was too early to discuss expanding the group's business into Israel, she said.
Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala declined to comment about potential business opportunities emerging from the deal, and some government departments deferred requests for comment to the foreign ministry.
'SIGNIFICANT UPGRADE'
Israeli Finance Minister Israel Katz said official ties with the UAE ""could be a basis for a very significant upgrade of Israel's economy, alongside, of course, the things they need from us - in water technology, agriculture, hi-tech"".
On Israel's Kan Radio, Katz highlighted the potential for grand, regional transportation projects - ""a rail connection between Gulf countries and Haifa port"" - that he said would make Israel the UAE's ""gateway to the Mediterranean"".
Such a rail network would have to cross Saudi Arabia, which has no relations with Israel and has so far been silent on its deal with the UAE.
An Israeli delegation is expected to travel to UAE within weeks to work out the modalities of normalisation, a historic shift that could reshape Middle East politics from the Palestinian issue to the fight against Iran.
The UAE would only be third Arab state in more than 70 years to establish relations with Israel, after Egypt and Jordan.
'NOT GOING TO BET THEIR SHIRTS'
But there are sensitivities for businesses in openly welcoming Israeli investment in the Arab world's second-largest economy when public opinion in the Middle East is largely pro-Palestinian.
Some in the UAE have called for boycotting Israel over its treatment of Palestinians in occupied territories.
Robert Mogielnicki of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington said UAE businesses would carefully gauge regional reactions to the deal to avoid tensions in existing relationships.
""Established UAE companies and family-owned businesses are not going to bet their shirts just to enter Israeli markets,"" he said.
Israeli investors acknowledge that new trade agreements would likely take time to strike, but say Israel's booming high-tech scene and innovations in agriculture would be tough for the UAE to pass up.
Jon Medved, CEO of Israeli crowdfunding firm OurCrowd, said ""co-investment talks are ongoing (with Israelis) throughout the Arab world, not just with the UAE"" - alluding to Israeli expectations that Bahrain and Oman would follow in normalising ties.
Tourism could also stand to benefit, some analysts say, though it would take time to kick off given the coronavirus pandemic's impact on global travel.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday Israel is preparing for direct flights, over Saudi Arabia, to the United Arab Emirates, but gave no timeframe for their start.
Saudi Arabia does not recognise Israel and its air space is closed to Israeli airliners.
Asked about flying to Israel, Dubai's Emirates said it had nothing to announce. Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.

1106,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 12:15PM ET</span>",G7 ministers to consider extending debt freeze for low-income countries: Treasury,"By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Finance ministers from the Group of Seven rich countries on Monday noted improved economic conditions in their economies, but underscored their concerns about the debt problems facing low-income countries, a U.S. Treasury spokesperson said.
During a teleconference hosted by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the ministers repeated their call for all official bilateral creditors to fully implement the G20 debt freeze for the poorest countries, and agreed to consider additional options, including extending the initiative into 2021, the spokesperson said.
The meeting also included the leaders of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, who have urged the Group of 20 countries to extend their Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) given the economic impact of the pandemic.
G20 members, including China, and the Paris Club of official creditors in April offered a freeze on debt service payments to the 73 poorest countries through year-end to free up an estimated $12 billion in funds for the poorest countries to fight the outbreak and mitigate its economic impact.
But implementation of the debt freeze has been challenging, triggering calls for its extension and expansion.
China's reluctance to include its state-supported China Development Bank and state-owned enterprises in the debt payment suspension and concerns over confidentiality agreements included in many Chinese loans to countries in Africa have slowed progress in executing the debt freeze, economists say.
Private-sector participation has also been sluggish.
The ministers agreed on Monday to ""advance debt data transparency and consider additional options going forward for low income countries, including an extension of the DSSI into 2021,"" the spokesperson said.
They also emphasized the need to manufacture and distribute vaccines and treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, particularly in low-income countries.

They also discussed country issues, including support for the people of Lebanon, the spokesperson said.

1110,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 06:44AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in The Market on Monday, August 17th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- China injects more liquidity, pushing oil prices to a five-month high (if only briefly). Political instability in Europe worsens as Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko invites protestors to kill him if they want new elections, and stocks are set to open higher, shrugging off rumblings about both the November election and the canceling of U.S.-China trade talks. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, August 17th.
1. China injects stimulus as recovery falters 
China’s stock markets rose after the central bank injected around $100 billion of liquidity into its money market through a 12-month lending facility.
The net addition of liquidity is smaller than the headline number, as around three quarters of the amount will replace loans to commercial banks that are due to be repaid over the next 10 days.
Market participants interpreted the move as a sign that the People’s Bank of China is still prepared to loosen policy further in case the economic rebound falters.
Data published last week showed China’s economy slowing down in July, with industrial production growth slowing and retail sales still down from year-earlier levels.
2. U.S., China scrap potentially embarrasing review of trade deal
Chinese stocks in the U.S. remain under pressure however after President Donald Trump during his press conference on Saturday that he’s “looking into” fresh measures against them.  Alibaba ADRs fell 1.2% in premarket trade.
Over the weekend, it emerged that the U.S. and China have postponed talks on reviewing the implementation of their ‘phase 1’ trade deal. Chinese purchases of U.S. products have totaled barely half of what was pledged under January’s deal, due not least to the pandemic, which has, at least temporarily, put Chinese demand for oil, liquefied natural gas and agricultural products on a lower trajectory. 
3. Stocks set to open a tad higher; NAHB index due
U.S. stocks are set to open marginally higher, with few clear drivers except – perhaps – relief that the U.S. avoided having to acknowledge the non-observation of the U.S.-China trade deal. That spares the administration from having to follow through on its threats of more economically damaging tariffs ahead of the election in November.
By 6:40 AM ET (1040 GMT), the US 30 Futures contract was up 59 points, or 0.2%, while the US 500 Futures contract was up 0.3% and the US Tech 100 Futures contract was up 0.6%.
At the same time, a closely-tracked indicator of volatility, the VIX futures contract, has fallen to its lowest since the pandemic erupted in March.
Earnings season is winding down, and with 90% of S&P 500 companies having reported, earnings are down on average by 53% from a year-earlier, while sales are down 11%. The figures underscore how much the summer’s rally owes to massive stimulus from the Federal Reserve and federal government. The former in particular has allowed stock analysts to base their valuations on the assumption of nearly-free money far into the future.
The NAHB house price indicator at 10 AM ET is the only major economic data due. Overnight, Japan confirmed a slightly smaller drop in second--quarter GDP than that recorded in Europe and the U.S.
4. Lukashenko talks tough after securing Russian support
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko told protesters that they would have to kill him to get new elections, a day after the eastern European country witnessed its largest-ever demonstration demanding his resignation.
Lukashenko’s comments came after a weekend telephone call with Vladimir Putin, president of Belarus’ most powerful ally and biggest creditor. The two sides offered differing versions of the call, with Belarus saying Russia had promised military assistance to keep Lukashenko in power (the Kremlin has recognized him as the legitimate winner of last weekend’s elections). The Kremlin, by contract, merely acknowledged Belarus’ assertion of “external factors” aiming to destabilize the country.
EU foreign ministers, who refused to acknowledge the election results at a meeting on Friday, called another emergency meeting for Wednesday. Poland (WA:GPW) and Russia, two countries that border the country, were two of the worst performing European markets on Monday, losing 0.9% and 0.3% respectively. The dollar rose 1% against the ruble
5. Oil prices drift down from five-month highs
Crude oil prices drifted lower after hitting new post-pandemic highs over the weekend in response to China’s latest stimulus measures.  
Prices were supported by signs of a further decline in U.S. drilling, as Baker Hughes’ U.S. rig count fell by another 4 to a fresh multiyear low of 172.
Offsetting that was another drop in the number of hedge funds willing to bet on higher prices. Net speculative long positions in crude fell by 16,000 contracts last week, according to the CFTC’s data.
By 6:30 AM, U.S. crude futures were down 0.1% at $41.97 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent was down 0.2% at $44.70 a barrel."

The storm caused widespread property damage in cities and rural towns and left more than half a million homes and businesses without power.
Media reports said there were at least three deaths caused by the storm in Iowa.
The storm compounded troubles for the U.S. farm economy already battered by extreme weather, the U.S.-China trade war and most recently, the disruption caused to labor and consumption by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Winds as high as 100 miles per hour (160 kph) hit eastern Nebraska, Iowa, Wisconsin and parts of Illinois in the widespread storm classified as a ""derecho"" by the National Weather Service.
The storm impacted 37.7 million acres of farmland across the Midwest, including 14 million in Iowa, the Iowa Soybean Association said on Friday, citing estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
 
The storm affected 58,000 holders of crop-insurance policies with a liability of around $6 billion in Iowa, including $1.86 billion for soybeans, the Iowa Soybean Association said, citing data from the USDA's Risk Management Agency.

1112,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>","Biden’s 2009 Lessons For Now: Spend Big, No Coddling Wall Street","(Bloomberg) -- When Joe Biden entered the White House as vice president in 2009, the country was in economic turmoil caused by a global financial meltdown. The new president, Barack Obama, gave Biden a leading role in the economic recovery -- and Biden’s approach then shows a former senator struggling to find middle-ground solutions that might anger people, but not alienate them.
Biden was willing to risk the wrath of Wall Street with his support for the Volcker Rule and other banking regulations, but didn’t embrace punitive demands from the left to break up big financial institutions. He fought to save third-ranked Chrysler Corp. when others on Obama’s team thought the carmaker should go under, because he feared the economic carnage of those lost jobs. He also focused on reviving manufacturers, clean energy and infrastructure, and on monitoring how the states were spending stimulus dollars.
On a September 2009 call with governors, Biden exhorted them to keep quarterly tabs of jobs saved by the Recovery Act. When the Democratic governor of Missouri, Jay Nixon, thanked him for his active involvement, Biden responded: “Pure self-interest, Jay. If it fails, I’m dead.”
If he’s elected in November, Biden, who accepts the Democratic presidential nomination this week, would once again step into the White House with the nation in economic crisis. Biden’s aides say he wants to pick up where he left off, especially in the areas of infrastructure and clean energy -- work that Obama started and Biden hopes to finish.
Corporate Taxes
Biden’s pushing $3.5 trillion in infrastructure, manufacturing and clean energy programs as central elements of financial stimulus that appears likely to grow substantially if he is elected.
He would pay for the programs by raising the corporate tax rate, through taxes on real-estate investors with income of more than $400,000, and with other levies. The campaign has said those tax increases would raise $4 trillion over a decade. Additional spending would likely be treated as one-time stimulus, meaning that Biden would add to the deficit without paying directly for the programs.
“We need a plan that’s as big as the problem we have,” said Ron Klain, a key adviser who was chief of staff when Biden was vice president. “These challenges that we faced in 2009 and 2010, they’re back again -- they never went away -- they’re back again with greater emphasis, and his experience doing that makes him well-positioned to put these issues front and center today.”
Anyone looking for clues to how Biden would try to solve today’s pandemic-fueled economic problems can find them in the way he approached the Great Recession and its aftermath when he was vice president.
Working the Phones
The month after Obama’s inauguration in January 2009, Congress narrowly passed an $800 billion stimulus package to begin reviving the economy. Biden spent long hours lobbying former Senate colleagues, including three moderate Republicans, to help secure the votes to get it through Congress.
“If Joe Biden had not been able to deliver those three Senate Republican votes that got us to exactly the number of votes we needed to pass the bill, the consequences for Barack Obama’s presidency and for our economy would’ve been quite great,” Klain said.
As a sign of the change in Washington’s culture since then, only one of those moderate Republicans -- Susan Collins of Maine -- is still in office, and she’s a tight race for re-election this year.
Obama assigned Biden with overseeing how the stimulus money was spent, with orders to get the funds out quickly and avoid waste that Republican critics could use to attack the effort.
Biden dialed up governors and local officials around the country to admonish them not to splurge on pet projects. “I remember being with him in his office when he was calling mayors of pretty small towns, who were very surprised to hear from him,” said Jared Bernstein, then Biden’s chief economist and a current campaign adviser. Christina Romer, then chairwoman of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, recalls him importuning local officials in one conversation: “No building swimming pools.”
Springsteen Vibe
In a White House marked by cerebral policy debates, Biden often seemed to draw on a visceral connection with the Rust Belt.
“He had a Bruce Springsteen vibe in the administration,” said Austan Goolsbee, an Obama economic adviser, meaning that Biden was always searching for a story-line on middle-class Americans. “I think Obama very much liked having someone at a high level with that vibe, to balance out the technocratic impulses of the economic team.”
Biden also staked out an aggressive position in the Obama administration’s internal debate over the auto industry bailout, a controversial move at the time. Mitt Romney, now a Republican Senator from Utah, famously urged against a rescue in a New York Times op-ed headlined “Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.”
Biden not only argued for the bailout but was a vocal advocate of saving Chrysler when others thought it was expendable. Though he wasn’t the only official to take that view, the argument put him at odds with Romer’s CEA, she recalled. Obama ultimately sided with Biden.
He again clashed with the economists over mounting a more aggressive effort to use federal resources to bolster the manufacturing sector, which had been shrinking even before the recession that began in the year before he and Obama were elected. That fight came to a head in an Oval Office meeting with Obama and Biden in side by-side armchairs, as advisers sat on two facing couches.
Biden was “visibly upset” as it became clear the economic team’s skepticism of industrial policy favoring one sector was prevailing, said Michael Greenstone, then the economic council’s chief economist, who was tapped to present the case against the idea.
After the meeting, Biden erupted steps outside the Oval Office. “He just starts lighting into me,” Greenstone recalled. “He said, ‘You economists, you don’t understand about people, that people’s self-worth and dignity is tied up in their work.’”
In what Greenstone took as a goodwill gesture after the scolding, Biden soon afterward invited him for a trip on Air Force Two to a manufacturing event in Ohio. “It wasn’t just a kiss-and-make-up,” Greenstone said. “It was: ‘You’re going to understand.’ And I think he was right, with the opioid crisis and deaths of despair and all the challenges that the Rust Belt has faced since then.”
Volcker Rule Champion
Biden had limited sympathy for Wall Street, whose embrace of subprime lending and mortgage-backed securities stoked the global financial crisis and helped plunge the U.S. into recession. He sided against the financial industry in key Obama administration debates over what became the Dodd-Frank regulatory reform, and he pressed to make the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau the centerpiece of the legislation.
He enthusiastically championed the Volcker Rule -- prohibiting banks from proprietary trading -- that Wall Street hated. It was a cause Biden took up after a conversation with former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. The vice president came to a White House meeting on the matter determined to prevail. He immediately began making his case for the rule, even though other items were first on the agenda.
“Part way through, the president puts his hand on the vice president’s arm and says, ‘Hold on there, Joe,’” Goolsbee recalled. “‘ Don’t worry. We’re going to get to it.’”
Biden was also a central player in negotiations that forced the Obama administration to make the painful choice to extend Bush administration tax cuts for the wealthy, which were reviled on the left, in return for a second stimulus in the form of a payroll tax cut that boosted the economy going into the 2012 election.
With the administration on its heels after Republican victories in the 2010 midterms, Obama’s team figured it had no choice but to extend the Bush-era tax cuts, said Gene Sperling, a senior Treasury Department official at the time and later Obama’s top economic adviser.
The team focused on continuing parts of the stimulus, extending emergency unemployment relief, tax credits for lower-income workers, and a new tax-cut stimulus. Biden won a promise from Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell for $120 billion in tax relief over two years, Sperling said. He then went back and negotiated for the full amount in 2011 as a one-year payroll tax cut, correctly anticipating the Republicans wouldn’t force an election-year tax hike. So the impact was doubled.
“We were all strategizing together, on what our goals were,” Sperling said. “But Biden was the one doing the negotiating, delivering.”
Working-Class Agenda
Biden sees common threads between the Great Recession when he was vice president and today’s economic problems.
“There are features of this crisis that are different obviously -- public health and the pandemic -- but he thinks that there is actually more room to make the case for a working-class agenda this time than there was in 2009,” said Jake Sullivan, a Biden policy adviser. “The American people have seen low-paid workers who don’t get strong benefits risking their lives to keep the economy running, and he thinks his ability to make the case to deliver on the worker part of his agenda is greater than it was in 2009.”
The Covid-19 pandemic and resulting recession has forced Biden to edge away from the moderate economic approach he advocated last year. At that point he called for a “reordering” of the capitalist system, which was mild compared with what progressives advocated. Now he’s proposing more drastic remedies to resuscitate the economy.
As he did in 2009, Biden considers running up the deficit as an unfortunate but necessary side effect of pumping money into the economy.
Public Works
His “Build Back Better” proposal is more oriented toward public works and community grants than tax cuts -- evidence that he’s even more comfortable than Obama in putting his thumb on the scale for manufacturing, and less worried about free-market economists’ misgivings over government support for legacy industries.
For much of his Senate career, Biden commuted to and from Washington on Amtrak’s train service from his home in Wilmington, Delaware. As vice president, he advocated for public works projects such as a smart electric grid, clean energy production, road and bridge construction, and high-speed rail.
“Everybody likes infrastructure, but nobody likes infrastructure as much as Joe Biden,” Romer said. “I can see a really big infrastructure package as the thing that really gets the economy going. He will deliver on it.”
The Biden team has yet to announce what, beyond the $3.5 trillion in infrastructure and other programs, it may do to respond to the ongoing struggles of the retail, restaurant, travel and small-business sectors upended by the pandemic, and the resulting loss of millions of jobs.
Republicans are skeptical, to put it mildly. “Going big, spending $3 trillion -- I think that gets it all wrong,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economic adviser to John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign who’s now president of the American Action Forum, a center-right policy organization.
Still, Holtz-Eakin gives Biden credit for helping to steer the country back to solvency a decade ago, and says it may help the former vice president manage a new crisis that twins economic and public health calamities in an unprecedented way. “Biden got the job of running that stimulus and he will only benefit from that experience,” Holtz-Eakin said.
A President Biden would return to a very different Washington. He argues Republicans will have an “epiphany” after President Donald Trump leaves office and want to work with a Democratic White House. That appears unlikely given the toxic politics in the capital. Even some Democrats will be hard to persuade that he’s right about how to fix the economy. And those on Wall Street and in the corporate world who argued that Biden and Obama got it wrong the last time around won’t be reassured to hear Biden saying he intends to pick up where he left off.
That’s where Biden’s decades in public life would come into play, his aides say. Unlike other politicians who take pride in declaring themselves strangers to Washington, Biden’s entire claim to the presidency is that he is the ultimate insider.
“It’s not just that he has a bold plan,” Klain said. “It’s that he actually also has the tools to get Congress to pass it.”

1113,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>",Trump’s Stimulus Stalemate With Democrats Leaves Economy Limping,"(Bloomberg) -- Chances for a deal in Congress on a new, comprehensive stimulus package before September diminish with each passing day, leaving the U.S. economy limping and many businesses and millions of consumers coming up short.
Democrats and Republicans are focused on their party presidential nominating conventions this week and next. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi headed to California after rebuffing an overture from President Donald Trump’s Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, to restart talks on a virus relief package without concessions.
Both chambers of Congress left Washington and had been scheduled to be gone until mid-September. But a financial crunch and political controversy involving the U.S. Postal Service prompted Pelosi to announce Sunday that the House would return later this week to vote on legislation that would prohibit the Postal Service from cutting service.
Some Democrats have been pushing Pelosi to vote on boosting funding for the post office, and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is continuing to press for a small-scale rescue package that would include stimulus checks for individuals and aid for small businesses. He said the GOP would back $10 billion in funding for the post office that Democrats have been seeking.
“We will pass it tomorrow,” Meadows said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” program. “The president will sign it. And this will all go away.”
However, Pelosi announced no other plans for votes, and she has repeatedly rejected any piecemeal deal on stimulus. A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell referred to the Kentucky Republican’s previous statement that Senators get 24 hour notice if they need to return to Washington.
The deadlock has persisted despite warnings from Federal Reserve officials, economists, governors and mayors that, with much of the earlier stimulus exhausted, the risk to the economy grows every day that goes by without a deal.
“If the economy has to wait until to the end of September, it will come to a virtual standstill between now and then, and vulnerable to anything else that goes wrong,” said Mark Zandi of Moody’s Analytics. “And given that we are in the middle of a pandemic, there is a lot that can go wrong.”
He estimates that delaying a new stimulus package would reduce gross domestic product at least 0.5% over the course of September, making it more likely that there will be increased unemployment by the end of that month.
Wall Street has been banking on a deal eventually being reached, but signs that the recovery is slowing have tamped down market enthusiasm. The S&P 500 slumped after fluctuating near all-time highs for much of the day on Friday and closed the week just 0.4% below its all-time high on Feb. 19, 2020.
Millions of people are relying on jobless benefits, which was evident from the June personal income data. Stimulus checks for individuals and the extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits bolstered incomes despite widespread joblessness. The data showed unemployment benefits made up about 7% Americans’ incomes in the month, the biggest share on record.
That extra money helped fuel spending at retailers. U.S. total retail sales have now rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, which is a win for the economy. But spending at restaurants and bars and at clothing stores -- sectors that have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic -- are far from fully recovered. In addition, total consumer outlays, which includes spending on goods and services, have yet to fully recover.
That added boost to spending expired at the end of July.
Progress, and Perils
The July jobs report marked a third straight month of solid improvement for the labor market. Employers added a better-than-expected 1.76 million workers to payrolls in the month, and the unemployment rate declined further. At the same time, the report highlighted longer-term concerns: Payrolls remain 13 million below pre-pandemic levels, the number of people who have been out of work for 15 weeks or longer more than doubled from the previous month and labor force participation declined.
A more timely measure of the jobs market -- weekly applications for unemployment insurance in regular state programs -- dipped below 1 million for the first time since March. While still higher than the worst week in the 2007-2009 recession, the figures confirmed the employment picture is getting brighter -- but also that it has a very long way to go.
“I remain a little bit mystified as to why we haven’t gotten to yes,” Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, told reporters Friday. “I do not share the optimism about a fast recovery that some conservative politicians seem to have.”
Dozens of issues and more than $1 trillion in total spending divided the White House and top Democrats when they suspended stimulus negotiations on Aug. 7.
$1 Trillion Gap
Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said they’d cut $1 trillion from their original $3.5 trillion stimulus plan if Republicans would raise their initial proposal to $2 trillion from $1 trillion.
“We said we’ll meet you half way, we’ll come down a trillion, go up a trillion, to again meet the needs of the state and local government,” Pelosi said Friday.
But Mnuchin said there were issues that couldn’t be resolved by simply splitting the difference. Trump and the GOP remain opposed to the Democrats’ insistence on almost $1 trillion in aid to state and local governments.
The president, in a series of tweets on Friday, accused Democrats of standing in the way of additional unemployment aid, checks to individuals and assistance for small businesses.
Trump took executive action last week to tap $44 billion in disaster aid funds to provide $300 a week in extra unemployment aid. He also let businesses defer payroll taxes. Yet it’s unclear how quickly Americans will see the extra money. And some employers may continue to withhold deferred payroll taxes since under current law they will be owed early next year.
Although it’s unclear how much of an effect the actions will have, they gave the president and Republican lawmakers an answer for voters looking for action.
Fed officials have been warning for weeks that the economy needs another big fiscal infusion.
“If we go very long without somehow addressing the reduction and evaporation of that support, I think it’s going to show up in lower aggregate demand,” Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said last week, “and that would be very costly for the economy.”

Total transits through the waterway rose to 933 in July, from 845 in June, which was the fewest since the canal opened an expanded set of locks four years ago to accommodate bigger ships.
Initial August numbers show further improvement, Canal Authority Deputy Administrator Ilya Espino de Marotta said in a phone interview.
Container shipping between the U.S. and Asia, the canal’s most important route, began to increase this month, she said. But cruise ships continue to cancel their slots, and the trade in Liquid Natural Gas may also take more time to recover, she added.
“If you go by segment we think containers might recover strongly, cruise liners not at all,” Espino de Marotta said.
More than 3% of the world’s maritime commerce transits the waterway, according to Fitch.
$2 Billion Investment
The canal’s locks are fed mainly by water from Gatun Lake, which also provides drinking water for Panama City. A series of droughts in recent years has caused the lake’s water levels to dip, forcing the canal to implement water-saving measures and restrict the depth of ships crossing the canal.
The canal authority has researched alternative water sources including nearby rivers and reservoirs they could potentially tap. The authority will open bidding in the next two months for feasibility studies for projects to tap new water sources, Espino de Marotta said. These will require an investment of as much as $2 billion, she added.

The People’s Bank of China added 700 billion yuan ($101 billion) of one-year funding via the medium-term lending facility, more than offsetting the 400 billion yuan in loans coming due Monday and another 150 billion yuan maturing on Aug. 26. It kept the interest rate on the funds unchanged at 2.95%. The yield on China’s 10-year government bonds was little changed at 2.94%.
“The MLF injection is larger than expected,” said Ming Ming, head of fixed-income research at Citic Securities Co. “The PBOC’s overall neutral monetary policy has an easing bias in August. I expect the 10-year government yield to drop to around 2.8%.”
The nation’s economy is recovering from the pandemic despite escalating tensions with the U.S., though consumption has failed to keep pace with a rebound in industrial output. Banks are counting on the PBOC’s cash injections to meet their demand for funding, as they need about $500 billion in fresh liquidity to roll over debt and buy government bonds this month.
The central bank added the most short-term funds into the financial system since May last week to soothe market nerves. In July, it drained cash at the fastest pace this year as stocks soared.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement it was keeping the rate on 700 billion yuan ($100.74 billion) worth of one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans to financial institutions steady at 2.95% from previous operations.

It also said it injected another 50 billion yuan through seven-day reverse repos while also keeping the borrowing cost steady.

1121,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2020 07:30PM ET</span>","Canada's Trudeau, finance minister clash over green plans, soaring deficit","By David Ljunggren and Julie Gordon
OTTAWA (Reuters) - A deepening rift between Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his finance minister about coronavirus spending is also fueled by disagreements over the scope and scale of proposed green initiatives, three sources familiar with the matter said.
Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau are scheduled to meet on Monday in a bid to sort out their differences, said a fourth source aware of the meeting. The sources requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.
Morneau and his team have pushed back against other Cabinet ministers about how much funding was needed, including to what extent the recovery could be helped by investing in environmental projects, the people added.
Trudeau, who campaigned on a platform to tackle climate change, believes the 2021 budget should have an ambitious environmental element to start weaning the heavily oil-dependent economy off fossil fuels and he recently hired former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney as an informal adviser, aides say.
The appointment, coupled with a Globe and Mail report that Trudeau and Morneau had clashed over the amount of money Ottawa is spending to combat the coronavirus, led to speculation about the future of the finance minister. Morneau, 57, has been in the job since the Liberals took power in late 2015.
Asked for a reaction, Trudeau spokesman Cameron Ahmad noted that the prime minister issued a statement on Tuesday saying he had ""full confidence"" in Morneau, who confidants say is alarmed by ballooning budget deficits.
An official working for Morneau said the finance minister was in constant touch with the Trudeau team on policy files.
""There are always discussions, but that's typical,"" said the official, adding that Morneau had been clear ""that we would need to invest for recovery.""
Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson along with Infrastructure Minister Catherine McKenna, a former environment minister, have met with top civil servants to discuss options that could involve billions of dollars in extra spending, said one of the three sources. Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault also attended the meetings.
Morneau's resistance to expensive environmental initiatives reflects his roots in Bay Street, Toronto's financial center, and a view held among right-leaning Liberals that deficits are out of control.  
""The idea of greening the economy just by spending money on every project you have in front of you is not really serious,"" said a fifth source sympathetic to Morneau's position.
    
'NEED TO GET A GRIP'
Possible budget measures range from investments to help provinces reduce their carbon footprints, boosting research into clean technology and encouraging the construction of efficient buildings.
""Morneau has been saying: 'We need to get a grip.' And that isn't always popular,"" said one of the three sources familiar with the matter.
Canada's budget deficit is forecast to hit C$343.2 billion ($253.4 billion), the largest shortfall since World War Two, this fiscal year. Total coronavirus support is nearly 14% of gross domestic product. 
""He was not very keen on a huge deficit; that's not what he wanted as his legacy,"" said a sixth source familiar with Morneau's thinking.
Problems between a finance minister and colleagues with ambitious proposals are not unusual. ""Every single department in government that spends money ends up butting heads with Finance,"" said the fifth source. 
But Morneau is feeling increasingly isolated at the Cabinet table, with no close allies, according to the source.

Adding to Morneau's challenges, several Cabinet members were upset when he disclosed he had forgotten to repay travel expenses covered for him by a charity at the heart of an ethics probe, one of the three sources said. Morneau and Trudeau are facing ethics inquiries related to the charity.

1122,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 16, 2020 07:09PM ET</span>",China’s Loss May Become India’s Gain in Shifting Supply Chains,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s latest set of incentives to entice businesses moving away from China seem to be working, with companies from Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co. to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s assembly partners showing interest to invest in the South Asian nation.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in March announced incentives that make niche firms -- electronics manufacturers -- eligible for a payment of 4%-6% of their incremental sales over the next five years. The result: about two dozen companies pledged $1.5 billion of investments to set up mobile-phone factories in the country.
Besides Samsung (KS:005930), those that have shown interest are Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., known as Foxconn, Wistron Corp. and Pegatron Corp. India has also extended similar incentives to the pharmaceutical sector, and plans to cover more sectors, which may include automobiles, textiles, and food processing under the program.
While companies have been actively looking to diversify supply chains amid the U.S.-China trade tensions and the coronavirus outbreak, it hasn’t yet translated into big gains for India despite the nation making it cheaper for businesses to open shop. Vietnam remains the most favored destination, followed by Cambodia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Thailand, according to a recent survey by Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc.
“There is a reasonable chance for India to gain in terms of incremental investment of supply chains within the country over the medium term,” said Kaushik Das, chief India economist at Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) in Mumbai. “These programs are aimed at increasing India’s manufacturing share in the gross domestic product.”
Economic Boost
The government expects the program for electronics alone could lead to $153 billion worth of manufactured goods over the next five years and create about one million jobs directly and indirectly.
This would bring an additional investment of $55 billion over five years, adding 0.5% to India’s economic output, according to analysts led by Neelkanth Mishra at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG. This could shift an additional 10% of global smart-phone production to India in five years, most of it from China, they wrote in a report Aug. 10.
That complements Modi’s goal to grow the share of manufacturing in the economy to 25% from the current around 15% as part of his ‘Make in India’ program. His government has already lowered taxes on companies to among the lowest in Asia, seeking to attract new investments in an economy headed for its first contraction in more than four decades this year.
The latest output-linked incentive plan is a “big win for Make in India,” Amish Shah, an analyst at BofA Securities, said in a report to clients. He sees gains for industrials, cement, pharmaceuticals, metals and logistics, with long-term indirect benefits across many sectors.

""I will fight to consign these unfair tariffs to the bin of history"", she wrote (https:// while accusing the European Union of failing to protect British and Scottish interests. 
The U.S. government said last week it would maintain 15% tariffs on Airbus (PA:AIR) aircraft and 25% tariffs on other European goods as part of a long-running trade dispute, although it held off adding some extra tariffs as it had threatened.
Britain had said it would step up demands for the United States to drop tariffs on goods such as single malt Scotch whisky after the industry warned a decision by Washington to retain the levy was putting its future at risk.
""U.S. tariffs on Scotch whisky are unacceptable and unfair. I cannot be clearer about that,"" Truss wrote. ""Whisky-making is one of our great industries and a jewel in our national crown.""
Truss said she would meet with her U.S. counterpart, Robert Lighthizer, in the coming weeks, as round four of U.S. negotiations begin, where she will address the existing tariffs on single malt Scotch and a host of other products. 
""On Japan, we have consensus on the major elements of a deal that will go beyond the agreement the EU has with Japan"", she added, reaffirming earlier reports that both countries seek to agree on a trade deal by the end of August. 
Britain, which left the European Union in January, is seeking to clinch a trade agreement with Japan based on the 2019 EU-Japan agreement by the end of the year, when Britain's no-change transition arrangement with the EU will expire.
""I firmly believe free and fair trade remains the best way forward for the world and for Britain"", she said, adding that talks with the United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand to strike new free trade agreements were progressing well.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina’s government on Sunday officially unveiled its amended bond restructuring offer in the state gazette and said creditors would have until August 28 to approve it. 
It follows the issuing on Saturday night of an official decree approving a second round of amendments to the government’s initial offer made back in April, an important step to clinch a deal. 
In an accompanying statement, the government said it would submit the new offer to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.
On Sunday, the government said in the official gazette that the invitation would expire at 5pm New York City time on Aug. 28, confirming an anticipated delay to its earlier deadline of Aug. 24 to give bondholders a 10-day window after the formal SEC filing.
Argentina and its main creditor groups reached an agreement in principle on Aug. 4 to restructure about $65 billion in distressed sovereign bonds after months of talks, breaking an impasse that had threatened to derail negotiations.
In the statement on Saturday night, the government said the formalized offer aimed to ""bring public finances into balance, give certainty to the private sector and provide the country with a new platform for growth"".
It added the proposal reflected the financial terms of the Aug. 4 agreement and dialogue with creditors, the International Monetary Fund and other international bodies on legal elements. It gave details of the amendments, which involved improving the net present value of the offer with earlier coupon payments but not additional cash flow.
With an already weak economy further punished by the coronavirus, the government wants to avoid the kind of messy sovereign bond default that punctuated a crisis in 2001 that tossed millions of middle class Argentines into poverty.

After the bond revamp is done, Argentina will start talks with the International Monetary Fund toward a new program to replace a defunct $57 billion standby lending deal negotiated by the previous administration two years ago.

Investing.com - Wall Street’s earnings season is winding down but there are a number of reports from some major retailers in the coming days, with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) likely to draw the most attention.
 
Investors will also focus on the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting, due on Wednesday, for further insight into the outlook for monetary policy through the end of the year and beyond.
 
Several important economic reports are also expected, with weekly jobless claims data on Thursday topping the list.
 
Elsewhere, in Europe, markets are keeping an eye on flash PMI surveys on manufacturing and service sector activity, which should give further indication of how the region's economy is coping with the coronavirus pandemic.
 
Meanwhile, commodity traders will focus on this week's Joint OPEC-Non-OPEC Ministerial Monitoring Committee, or JMMC, meeting of major crude producers as they review the latest developments in oil markets.
 
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of the five biggest events on the economic calendar that are most likely to affect the markets.
 
1. Walmart Earnings
 
Walmart is one of the biggest names slated to report second-quarter results this week, as the earnings season on Wall Street continues to wind down.
 
The retail giant is expected to report earnings per share of $1.25 on revenue of $135.29 billion, according to analysts polled by Investing.com, when it reports before the opening bell on Tuesday.
 
Walmart has been one of the strongest performers in the retail space in recent months, with shares up around 30% from their March lows, thanks in large part to rapid growth in e-commerce and online sales amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
 
Other notable companies reporting results this week include,  Target  (NYSE:TGT),  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW), Kohls (NYSE:KSS), TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX),  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA).

The U.S. central bank left interest rates on hold at the conclusion of its policy meeting on July 29 and pledged to keep the monetary spigot wide open until the economy has weathered the impact of the virus.
 
The Fed acknowledged that economic activity had picked up somewhat in recent months, though conceded that it remained ""well below"" levels seen at the beginning of the year.
 
Recent economic data has validated the central bank's concerns as strength in the labor market and consumer confidence appear to be on the wane.
 
3. U.S. Jobless Claims 
 
The Labor Department will release weekly data on initial jobless claims at 8:30AM ET Thursday.

In recent years, China has clamped down on shadow banking, concerned about the hidden risks in the high volume of complex and potentially risky loans in the sector. But as a weakening economy puts pressure on businesses and individuals, authorities fear shadow lending and illegal loans might surge.
After the outbreak of the new coronavirus this year, high-risk banks with complex structures may stage a comeback, Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, wrote in an article published in the Communist Party journal Qiushi.
""A slight relaxation of regulations may lead to a full resurgence, and all previous efforts would go to waste,"" Guo wrote.
Due to the coronavirus epidemic, leverage is expected to rebound significantly in the Chinese economy this year, and bad debts of financial institutions may rise substantially, he warned.
After the ""black swan"" epidemic, it is inevitable that asset quality will deteriorate, and due to a time lag, the current asset classification has not accurately reflected the true risk, he said.
A ""black swan"" event refers to an unforeseen occurrence that typically has extreme consequences.
Financial institutions should dispose of non-performing assets as early as possible, and covering up would only bring serious consequences, Guo said.
China should also implement targeted measures in dealing with institutions with varying levels of risk, he said.
Outside of China, external factors could also threaten financial security, Guo said.
Current international cooperation is not ideal, and the U.S. entity list imposed on some companies including Chinese firms has added uncertainty to the global economic recovery and disrupted financial stability and security, he said.
Washington restricts sales of U.S. goods to companies on the entity list.

1130,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 15, 2020 07:08AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: The Case for Low Interest Rates,"By Liz Moyer and Peter Nurse
Investing.com -- U.S. Treasury yields soared in the middle of last week, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note closing Wednesday at 0.761%, its highest level since early April.
These yields have slipped back since, and the trend has been lower for more than 30 years. But investors may have to start thinking about higher yields going forward. After all, how much lower can they really go?
Investing.com's Liz Moyer explains why rates will stay low, while Peter Nurse offers reasons for their inevitable rise. This is Point/Counterpoint.
Low Rates Will Stay Low
Stock markets continue to climb despite a lack of evidence that the economy is making a strong comeback after Covid-19 lockdowns forced businesses to close and lay off millions of workers. There are still millions of people unemployed, though jobs have started to come back. And businesses are still struggling to rebound from the shutdowns, and many mom and pop operations face permanent closure.
In March, the Fed slashed rates to zero and took other emergency actions to try and supercharge the flailing economy. After losing nearly one-third of its value during the spring, the S&P 500 has retraced its move to approach its Feb. 19 all-time high.
Sure, interest rates are bouncing back from lows. In the mortgage market, 30-year fixed rate loans averaged a rate of 2.96% this week, up 0.08 points from the previous week. The 15-year loan average rate was 2.46% from a record low.
But something else is going on. People have been focused on the concept of negative real rates, which is what you get when you take the interest rate and factor inflation into it. During the last two months, as Barron's recently noted, the real rate of the 10-year Treasury dropped from negative 0.36% to negative 1.05%, which makes it the lowest in nearly 18 years.
Treasury data show negative real rates across the spectrum. The real rate on the five-year was negative 1.24% as of Thursday. For the 10-year, it was negative 0.96%, and or the 30-year, it was negative 0.30%. This is as reflected in the yields of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.
The trend could explain some other phenomena in the market. Gold soared to fresh highs above $2000 in recent weeks (it gave some of that back this week). Gold is seen as a store of value, and investors may be flocking to it because it doesn't cost them money to hold, as bonds with negative rates would.
And gold's counterpart, the U.S. dollar, has fallen relative to other currencies. Negative real rates also make the dollar less attractive compared to others.
Negative rates could also help explain the rally in risk assets like stocks. If investors want to earn a return, they are better off putting their money in the stock market rather than notes at negative rates, which, again, cost money to hold.
Massive fiscal stimulus programs and bond buying by the Federal Reserve are driving rates lower. In ordinary times, this would encourage companies to make big capital expenditures. But a Covid-weakened economy means businesses are holding off on spending, the opposite of the government's goal of spurring growth.
Richard Koss, an economist and the chief research officer at New York mortgage data fintech firm Recursion, explains that the virus is a supply shock, which is unsettling the natural order of things. Car sales are down over last year while car prices are up, for example. Supply chains are messed up.
The economy is undergoing secular shifts like working from home and e-commerce ""we can barely start to understand,"" Koss says. ""Huge adjustments have to be made to the new era, and transitioning to the new resilient world will be costly.""
That ""doesn't support a big increase in yields.""
Low Rates are Set to Rise
Last week's move up in yields was driven by both repositioning ahead of big issuance this week and a sense that the U.S. recovery is broadening and looking more robust, said NAB strategist Rodrigo Catril, in a note to investors earlier this week.
""That is reflected in the rotation in equities into more cyclical sectors and plays into the idea that U.S. Treasury yields should be higher, reflecting that improvement in prospects for the global recovery,"" he said.
This week saw better-than-expected employment data and increased supply with a massive $112 billion debt sale.
Hefty auctions will become regular occurrences given the U.S. budget deficit climbed to $2.81 trillion in the first 10 months of the budget year, the Treasury Department said Wednesday, exceeding any on record. This deficit has to be financed somehow.
Similarly, solid employment news continued Thursday with the number of Americans seeking jobless benefits dropping below one million last week for the first time since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States.
In a separate report on Thursday, import prices increased 0.7% in July, driven by higher costs for fuel. This follows sharply on the heels of data this week showing consumer and producer prices accelerated in July, dispelling fears of deflation.
While the slowdown is by no means over and the employment situation could still get worse given the renewed lockdowns imposed in a number of states on the back of the second wave of the coronavirus, the Federal Reserve must be encouraged by the latest economic data.
And there’s still the potential for the political impasse in Washington to be overcome and another stimulus program launched.
That may not look likely at the minute, with both sides seemingly preferring to play the blame game rather than make any serious moves to break the deadlock. But neither will want to go into the election campaign running the risk of being blamed for the continued pain in U.S. households.
A number of Fed speakers have tried recently to impress upon the policymakers of the need for more fiscal largesse, hoping Congress will do more of the heavy lifting.
Talk of negative interest rates at the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, in the middle of September, has largely disappeared, with Chair Jerome Powell dismissing the possibility on a number of occasions.
That said, the central bank could seek to depress longer-term rates to keep borrowing costs cheap as the U.S. continues to work its way through recovery. It could do that either through forward guidance (by stating its intention to keep rates near-zero until inflation or unemployment reaches certain targets) or yield curve control (where the Fed purchases Treasuries until bond yields are below a stated level). 
The Fed chose not to do so in July. Deciding not to do so in September would likely result in yields rising across the board."
1131,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>",German union IG Metall backs four-day week to save jobs,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's largest trade union, IG Metall, on Saturday proposed negotiating for a move to a four-day week to help secure jobs against economic fallout from the coronavirus crisis and structural shifts in the automobile industry.
IG Metall, which represents 2.3 million employees in the metal working and electrical sectors, often makes demands that set benchmarks for wage negotiations in those industries and beyond.
""The four-day week... could make it possible to keep industrial jobs instead of scrapping them,"" its leader Joerg Hofman told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily.
The coronavirus crisis has put some 300,000 jobs at risk in Germany's metal and electrical industry, an IG Metall board member said last month.
The gradual switch to electric cars also threatens tens of thousands of engine and gearbox manufacturing jobs in Germany.
Hofman said that, if companies agreed to cut working time, employees should not necessarily see their salary cut by the same amount or they would not be able to afford to work fewer hours.
He said companies had an interest in cutting hours rather than laying off staff, as this would allow them to retain skilled workers and save redundancy costs.
Hofman also called on the government to extend short-time working benefits that have helped cushion the blow of the pandemic to 24 months from a current maximum of 21 months.
Short-time work is a form of state aid that allows employers to switch employees to shorter working hours during an economic downturn to keep them on the payroll.
About 5.6 million Germans currently benefit from the scheme, according to the Ifo research institute.
After a series of strikes, the IG Metall union agreed a deal in 2018 to allow staff to cut their working week to 28 hours for up to two years to care for children or other relatives.

""Economic activity in the UK is not falling like a stone. In fact, it has now been rising for more than three months, sooner than anyone expected,"" Haldane wrote. 
He said while shops remain shuttered, people turned to online shopping and sales rose over 70%, leading retail spending levels to recover to pre-pandemic levels.
Businesses in the services and manufacturing sectors grew at the fastest rate in more than five years in July, according to a IHS Markit/CIPS survey released in early August. 
Haldane, who voted against expanding BoE stimulus in June, said that the central bank will continue to support the economy until recovery is well under way.
Haldane said that GDP is expected to rise by over 20% in the second half of the year. By his estimates, the economy has been rising an average of about 1% per week.
""While that leaves activity well below pre-Covid levels, the UK has already recovered perhaps half of its losses,"" the op-ed said.
Haldane said the recovery in jobs would take longer but the risks to jobs have receded as spending and business confidence had picked up. 
Last week the BoE forecast it would take until the final quarter of 2021 for the economy to regain its previous size, and warned unemployment was likely to rise sharply. 

The BoE, which cut interest rates to just 0.1% in March, added that it saw no immediate case to cut interest rates below zero.

1133,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 07:07PM ET</span>",Lawyer who took on Chevron in Ecuador is disbarred in New York,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Steven Donziger, the American lawyer who spent more than two decades suing  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) over pollution in the Ecuadorian rain forest, has been disbarred in New York by a state appeals court.
Nine years ago, Donziger had won a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in an Ecuador court, but was unable to enforce it after a U.S. judge found it had been obtained through fraud.
In a decision published Thursday, the appeals court faulted Donziger's ""egregious"" misconduct, which it said included ghostwriting a court expert's report, obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and judicial coercion and bribery ""which he steadfastly refuses to acknowledge and shows no remorse for.""
Martin Garbus, a lawyer for Donziger, said in a statement on Donziger's Twitter feed that his client will appeal.
""This is a horrendous decision"" that deprives Ecuadorians harmed by Chevron of their main advocate, Garbus said. ""He is being singled out because he so threatens Chevron and the fossil fuel industry.""
Chevron declined to comment. Donziger did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment. The decision prevents him from practicing law in New York.
Donziger, a Harvard Law School graduate, represented villagers in Ecuador's Lago Agrio region who sought to hold Chevron liable for water and soil contamination from 1964 to 1992 by Texaco, which Chevron acquired in 2001.
While not disputing that pollution occurred, San Ramon, California-based Chevron contended that Texaco cleaned up the area, and state-owned Petroecuador was mainly responsible for the contamination.
In 2014, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan said Donziger and his legal team used bribery, coercion and fraud to obtain the judgment against Chevron, including a $500,000 bribe to the presiding judge. He barred them from ""profiting in any way from the egregious fraud that occurred.""
Several countries have rejected efforts by Donziger or Ecuador to enforce the judgment. In 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to consider the case.
The legal battle was also the subject of a 2009 documentary, ""Crude.""

Donziger had been suspended from law practice in July 2018, but a judicial referee in February recommended his reinstatement.
In rejecting Donziger's request to affirm that recommendation, the appeals court said the referee had been ""too dismissive"" of the severity of Donziger's misconduct.
Donziger faces a scheduled Sept. 9 trial in Manhattan federal court for criminal contempt.

1134,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 06:55PM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S.-China trade deal review postponed as China ramps up farm, energy purchases","By David Lawder and Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and China have delayed a review of their Phase 1 trade deal initially slated for Saturday, sources familiar with the plans told Reuters, citing scheduling conflicts and the need to allow time for more Chinese purchases of U.S. exports.
No new date for the initial six-month compliance review between U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He has been agreed, the sources said.
The officials were expected to hold a videoconference on Saturday, the six-month anniversary of the trade deal's Feb. 15 entry into force as the coronavirus pandemic began spreading globally.
One source familiar with the talks said the delay was related to a conference of senior Communist Party leaders at the seaside town of Beidaihe on China's northeast coast. The postponement did not reflect any substantive problem with the trade deal, the source said, adding: ""The new date has not been finalized yet.""
U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday repeated his view that the trade deal was ""doing very well,"" but did not comment on the delayed meeting. The White House referred queries on the talks to Lighthizer's office, which did not respond to a Reuters query about plans for the review.
Another source familiar with the plans said that U.S. officials wanted more time to allow China to increase purchases of U.S. goods agreed in the deal, to improve the political optics of the review.
China's imports of U.S. farm and manufactured goods, energy and services are well behind the pace needed to meet a first-year target increase of $77 billion over 2017 purchases.
But as China's economy has recovered from a coronavirus lockdown earlier this year, purchases have increased. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported the sale of 126,000 tonnes of soybeans to China, marking the eighth consecutive weekday with large sales to Chinese buyers.
U.S. oil traders, shipbrokers and Chinese importers also told Reuters that Chinese state-owned oil firms have tentatively booked tankers to carry at least 20 million barrels of U.S. crude for August and September, indicating a ramp-up in energy purchases. 
Trump administration officials have signaled that they are satisfied with the pace of purchases in recent weeks and have no plans to abandon the trade deal, which also includes some increased access for U.S. financial services firms in China, strengthened intellectual property protections and removal of some agricultural trade barriers..
Delaying the meeting, even briefly, could allow China to complete more purchases, which would help Lighthizer persuade Trump to stick to the deal. 
Signs of Chinese compliance could also help blunt criticism from Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who last week said the agreement that Trump has called a historic win is ""failing.""
""I think Trump is a little afraid that this triumph of his will be hung around his neck, but more purchases and a bit of a delay would clearly help,"" said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
""But he does own it, so they're going to have to put the best face on it,"" she said of the Phase 1 deal.

The trade agreement has emerged as a lone source of stability amid significant strain in the U.S.-China relationship over the coronavirus pandemic, human rights crackdowns and U.S. sanctions on Chinese companies and phone apps.

1135,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 05:55PM ET</span>","U.S. prosecutors probe ex-NASA official, Boeing over space contract: sources","By Joey Roulette and Eric M. Johnson
WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into whether NASA's former head of human spaceflight gave  Boeing Co  (N:BA) improper guidance during a lucrative lunar-lander contract competition, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The Justice Department has sent subpoenas to NASA, Boeing and Doug Loverro, who led the agency's marquee space travel program until he resigned abruptly in May, as part of a grand-jury investigation into the possible violation of federal procurement laws, the sources said.
In the probe, opened in June, prosecutors are focusing on communication between Loverro and Boeing space executive Jim Chilton in late January, during a blackout period for the Human Landing System competition, one of the sources said.
Representatives for Boeing and Loverro declined to comment. NASA declined to comment on personnel matters and the status of any investigation, but said the agency was confident in its procurement processes. 
The probe was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal.
The investigation, and an earlier probe by a NASA watchdog, has cast a shadow over one of NASA's most ambitious endeavors: sending humans back to the moon from U.S. soil for the first time in nearly half a century.
In April, NASA bypassed Boeing - an industry juggernaut with deep ties to space travel - and awarded contracts worth a combined $1 billion to Elon Musk's SpaceX, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, and Leidos Inc affiliate Dynetics to build lunar landing vehicles that can carry astronauts to the moon by 2024. 
Boeing was removed from the competition, NASA said in April, without explaining why.
Two people briefed on a NASA watchdog investigation told Reuters Boeing's removal was over its contact with Loverro.
The sources said NASA's Office of Inspector General found that Loverro told Boeing during a blackout period the company's proposal was incomplete and discussed aspects of the bid that were missing.
After discussions with Loverro, Boeing officials submitted another version during the blackout period, raising legal concerns among agency procurement staff, one of the people said.
Loverro abruptly resigned in May after less than a year on the job, telling employees in an email seen by Reuters that he took certain ""risks"" to meet NASA's 2024 moon deadline. 

""It is clear that I made a mistake in that choice for which I alone must bear the consequences,"" Loverro said, without explaining the mistake he was referring to.

""It's difficult to expect a V-shaped recovery. ... Rather, it could be a U-shaped recovery. That's what I think could happen,"" board member Javier Guzman said in a Mexican radio interview.
Guzman said he also did not rule out a W-shaped recovery, in the event that further coronavirus outbreaks forced businesses to once again go into lockdown.
Lopez Obrador has predicted a V-shaped recovery in Latin America's second-largest economy, which is forecast to shrink as much as 10% or more this year. 
Guzman said he expected inflation would reach the Bank of Mexico's 3% target rate in the second half of 2021, after an increase in prices this year.
The central bank on Thursday cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 4.5%, its lowest level in four years, but showed signs that the pace of cuts could slow.
In a separate interview, Bank of Mexico Governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon suggested the pace of reductions might in fact ease if inflationary pressures persist.
""If the factors that have pressured inflation ease more quickly that opens space (for monetary policy), if those factors increase and continue to pressure inflation upwards there will be less space,"" said Diaz de Leon.

""Clearly as you lower (rates) you naturally have less space,"" said Diaz de Leon.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Newly oil-producing Guyana has co-nominated White House adviser Mauricio Claver-Carone as its own candidate for the presidency of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the latest twist in an increasingly heated debate over who should lead the bank.
Claver-Carone, the son of Cuban immigrants, has been nominated by U.S. President Donald Trump to lead Latin America's main development bank. He told Reuters that Guyana's move reflected growing support for his candidacy, and other countries could follow suit.
However, Argentina, Mexico, Costa Rica and Chile, as well as European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, have all urged a delay in the Sept. 12 vote, expressing concerns about having someone from outside the region lead the bank for the first time in six decades.
The opposition also reflects concerns that Trump could lose the Nov. 3 U.S. election, and his candidate could find it difficult to work with a Democratic administration.
Claver-Carone, due to visit Colombia and Panama next week as part of a delegation led by U.S. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, said 17 countries backed him publicly and four more had expressed support in private.
In an interview at the White House, Claver-Carone said moves by an ""obstructionist"" minority of bank shareholders to delay the election could endanger the future of the bank, and jeopardize its ability to raise funds in the future.
""Essentially you're leaving the bank in vacuum. It's extraordinarily irresponsible,"" he said, adding it would also ""surely lead to a downgrade in its credit rating.""
To win, a candidate needs the backing of at least 15 of the 28 regional member countries and a majority of the total vote, calculated by each country's shares in the bank. Opponents could thwart a vote by skipping the meeting, since a quorum of at least 75% must be present for the election to proceed.
Chile, Mexico, Argentina and Costa Rica combined represent just over 22% of the vote, and could still draw support from some European countries that have small shares of votes.
Guyana's decision to nominate him reflected the breadth of his support, Claver-Carone said, adding, ""Other countries have expressed their desire to co-nominate and will be doing so as well."" He did not name those countries.
He cited a tradition of officials continuing to serve at institutions like the World Bank, even if the president who nominated them left office, and said he would work to mend fences.
""One of the things that people know about me is that they can knock on my door with agreements or disagreements,"" he said. ""I'm very honest. I'm very straightforward. I'm not shy.""
And the debate over his candidacy could stimulate more interest in the bank and its work, he said.
""We've talked more about the IDB in the last six weeks than I think had been discussed in the last 60 years,"" he said. ""Let's channel that energy positively. And I think at the end of the day, who is going to come out winning is the IDB.""

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>",Can U.S. retail sector's 'V-shaped' rebound jump the fiscal cliff?,"By Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - Even with nearly a fifth of the labor force collecting unemployment benefits in July, Americans continued spending with relative gusto, driving retail sales back to pre-coronavirus levels as they shifted shopping online, brought their food home, and stocked up on new appliances.
The downside: It was government money they spent, and that is now drying up even as a recent spate of unexpectedly upbeat economic data - including a larger-than-expected rise in payrolls last month and the first drop below 1 million in weekly new jobless claims since March - takes the pressure off Congress to renew the unemployment benefit supplement and business loan programs that ended last month.
The dilemma is a stark one as the United States ends its first half-year of pandemic confusion. Is the economy on its way back as consumers and businesses learn to live with new health risks, or nearing a more serious nosedive?
(GRAPHIC: A 'V'-shaped recovery? For retail sales, yes - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjvqwraovx/Pasted%20image%201597409338967.png)
Consumer spending drives about two-thirds of the U.S. economy, and the July numbers ""are encouraging because they suggest the recovery has continued to grind on even in the fact of the resurgence in virus cases,"" wrote Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics. Though the loss of unemployment income, if it persists, ""poses a downside risk to spending in the near term ... consumption growth will recover gradually from here.""
Oxford Economics senior U.S. economist Lydia Boussour, by contrast, called the July number ""sobering"" because it was below expectations, and signaled consumers were already growing cautious through July as the growth in coronavirus cases rebounded and some states imposed new restrictions, unemployment remained high, and the expiration of government benefits approached.
The 1.2% jump in retail sales was ""only half the expected gain,"" she wrote, and ""underscores that wary consumers have turned more cautious ... The recovery in consumption ... will be restrained by income cliffs and renewed virus fear.""
Those two views - of a recovery grinding ahead as people adapt and health risks are gradually controlled, or of massive family and business failures in the near future - are at the root of a stalemate in the U.S. Congress that saw lawmakers head home until September with no sign of progress on a new stimulus package.
(GRAPHIC: Is the U.S. retail rebound out of 'control'? - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakpembjzpr/Pasted%20image%201597417022919.png)
That makes August a test of whether daily growth in coronavirus cases will continue a recent decline even as some schools and colleges reopen, whether the economy will continue to grow despite the health risks, and whether unemployed Americans have managed to put enough in the bank to get them through until their jobs return.
The extra $600 per week in unemployment benefits paid from roughly April through July, along with loans to businesses, led to a record increase in personal savings and allowed some households to pay down debts. Some Federal Reserve officials have noted that puts ""firepower"" in the hands of businesses and households that could tide them over for a while.
Recent data through July, for example, showed overall bankruptcies down 25% over the same seven-month period in 2019.
But the vice may tighten fast. A moratorium on evictions has expired: that means grim choices ahead for families that had used rent money for food or other purchases in recent months.
And the details of the spending report show similarly tough decisions for others, particularly those among the millions who have been laid off from restaurant and hospitality jobs.
High-frequency data has shown that growth in traffic to those sorts of businesses has plateaued, and the July sales statistic backed that up. Americans got their calories and their beer and wine - but from online orders or directly from grocery and liquor stores, not in restaurants, where spending remained 20% off last July's level.
(GRAPHIC: Burger and a beer? - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgpdndqnpo/Pasted%20image%201597418265926.png)
That means a different labor market emerging that may need fewer workers than before, no guarantee of an easy transition for those caught in it, and a need for more government help to ease the crunch.
The failure to renew benefits will ""reverberate across the economy,"" analysts from the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics said, with a potential $500 billion drop in personal income following the expiration of government programs causing a jump of as much as 5% in the unemployment rate - back towards the record level hit in April.
The unemployment rate dipped to 10.2% in July after hitting 14.7% in April, with the U.S. economy still about 14 million jobs below where it was before the coronavirus lockdowns began.
Economic policymakers are wary of the evolving dilemma.
""Consumers are still spending,"" Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said on Friday, noting how the trillions of dollars pumped into the economy by the massive stimulus package passed by Congress in March and programs from the U.S. central bank and others ""helped make our economic statistics somewhat better.""
Kaplan said he was worried the risks from a loss of benefits are real given the large number of unemployed workers. 

""I am still concerned how quickly they will be able to get back to work,"" he said. ""If they have to shift industries how long that will take ... Not only will you not have a job, will you be able to make ends meet?""

EU-UK talks begin on Aug 17. The two sides remain far apart, but the meetings may show if they can lay aside their differences in time to reach a deal by the Oct. 2 deadline. An impasse may spell trouble for sterling and further pressure on domestic-focused shares. 
The Bank of England is not considering negative interest rates just yet, but the prospect of crashing out of the European Union without a deal might leave it with no alternative.

3/GOLD FOR GREENBACKS
The dollar's 5% plunge in five weeks has got gold bugs excited. Prices for the metal vaulted to a record above $2,000 per ounce before retreating as the greenback regained some poise.
Dollar weakness could run further -- it remains strong across various trade-weighted indexes. But correlations between gold and the dollar, tenuous at best, have weakened under the impact of central bank stimulus, with 90-day correlations approaching cyclical lows.
Finally, rising inflation expectations boost hedges such as gold. Refinitiv data shows U.S., UK, German and Japanese 10-year real, inflation-adjusted yields in negative territory, a first for all of them simultaneously. So even if gold struggles above $2,000, gold bugs can probably rest assured a big selloff isn't imminent.

Tesla is giving out five shares for each share held; Apple has a four-for-one offer. Companies typically split shares to make them cheaper for retail investors, but these days, with platforms already offering fractional shares for as little as $1, such splits don't attract investors in droves. Shares have risen since the announcements, but it remains to be seen whether gains continue until Aug. 31, when trading starts on a split-adjusted basis for both Apple and Tesla.

But BHP is more than just a miner -- steel is a bellwether for economic growth and its main ingredient, iron ore, sits at a critical juncture. Many question whether Chinese demand is enough to offset crumbling orders elsewhere.
BHP is also a gauge of China's economic health. After July shipments to China from the world's largest export hub, Australia's Port Hedland, dipped 17.5% from June, investors will be listening out for management's view on the outlook.

1142,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 01:18PM ET</span>",Fed’s Kaplan Says Inflation Can Run ‘Moderately’ Above 2% Goal,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve could allow inflation to accelerate above its 2% goal if has underperformed it in the past, said Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.
“I would be willing to see inflation run moderately above 2% in the aftermath of periods where we’ve been running persistently below,” Kaplan said Friday in a virtual event with the Dallas Friday Group, a business organization.
Kaplan said he would be comfortable with inflation around 2.25% or 2.375%. The policy, known as average inflation targeting, would be a shift from the Fed’s current way of keeping prices stable, in which it targets 2% regardless of what has happened in the past.
The Fed last year conducted a policy framework review after inflation struggled to persistently reach 2% in the last recovery. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking at a July 29 press conference, said deliberations would be wrapped up in the “near future.”
How the Fed reacts to inflation will, however, be subject to what happens in the economy, Kaplan said.
“I’m not making a commitment of what we’re going to do, I’m basically suggesting a tendency or likelihood, but it’s going to be subject to conditions we find and we’re going to have to adapt to those conditions,” he said.
Subdued inflation before the pandemic allowed the Fed to run the economy hotter, which spurred traditionally marginalized workers to enter the labor market. The gap between White and Black unemployment reached a historic low last year. It has widened again since the onset of the coronavirus.
Kaplan said the Fed has given a clear indication of what monetary policy will look like for the next couple of years, with interest rates likely remaining near zero barring any economic surprises. Powell has said that the central bank is “not even thinking about thinking about raising rates.”
As the current crisis continues and with the virus resurgence not letting up, more small businesses are likely to fail, Kaplan said. Another round of the Paycheck Protection Program, which gave out $525 billion in loans before closing last week, will probably be needed, he said.
The Fed’s Main Street Lending Program, which so far has had little take up, currently can’t be accessed by riskier mid-size businesses, which wouldn’t meet its credit requirements. Fed leaders and their counterparts at the Department of Treasury, which approves the Fed’s emergency lending facilities, are continuing discussions on the program, Kaplan said.
State and local governments will also need assistance as they’re facing massive budget shortfalls amid lower tax revenue, Kaplan said. These entities have in some cases provided aid to undocumented workers, who don’t qualify for federal relief and have been particularly hurt by the pandemic as they are disproportionately employed in service-sector jobs.
“Without fiscal relief I think you’ll see even more stress” for undocumented workers, Kaplan said.
Lawmakers in Congress have been debating another round of stimulus but are at an impasse, with Republicans and Democrats more than $1 trillion apart in what the total size of the package should be.
The U.S. economy, which contracted 32.9% on an annualized basis in the second quarter, will grow 20% in the three months ending Sept. 30 and 6% to 7% in the final quarter, Kaplan forecast. The economic recovery has been muted by the resurgence in coronavirus cases and will look “more like a swoosh” than a “V,” he said, adding that gross domestic product will contract 4.5% for the year overall.
‘Studying Other Countries’
Germany, France, Japan and South Korea have all helped policy makers understand the importance of widespread mask wearing and testing to containing the spread of the disease, Kaplan said: “We’re learning more from studying other countries, their experiences, to learn what we might be able to do better.”
Policy makers should be wary of how money is being spent during this crisis, given the substantial increase in government debt.
“We’re already leveraged more than we can realistically manage,” Kaplan said. “In the short run, I’d rather spend millions and, if necessary, billions on universal mask wearing, good testing regimes, contact tracing, in order to avoid spending trillions in unemployment benefits and all the ramifications of lost GDP.”

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's cap on banker bonuses introduced after the financial crisis a decade ago can help to curb excessive risk-taking, a Bank of England study showed on Friday.
Britain had unsuccessfully opposed the cap, but bankers in London have been nurturing hopes that it could be discarded now that the country has left the EU and no longer has to apply its rules from January.
Under the rule, a bonus can be no more than 100% of a banker's fixed pay, or double that amount with shareholder approval. The deferred non-cash portion of a bonus can also be clawed back if any misconduct emerges.
""This finding supports the view that some appropriately designed restrictions on bonus payments could mitigate excessive risk-taking,"" the Bank of England staff working paper said. 
Britain had argued that the cap would be counterproductive by bumping up fixed pay.
The central bank's research said its ""lab experiment"" using university students showed a tendency to take greater risks when someone's bonus was linked to investment performance relative to that of his or her peers - a common feature in financial firms - than when it depended on a person's own performance only.
A separate Bank of England working paper on Friday said the central bank's asset purchase program during the financial crisis did not directly boost lending by banks to the economy even though some knock-on effect had been expected.
This was probably due to banks not holding enough capital at the time, the paper said.
In the current COVID-19 recession, the BoE revived asset purchases, though this time round banks are far better capitalized.

Nonfarm business employee output per hour increased at a 7.3% annualized rate from April through June, the biggest gain since the first quarter of 2009, after declining at a revised 0.3% pace in the first quarter, according to Labor Department figures Friday. The second-quarter pace was faster than the 1.5% projection in Bloomberg’s survey of economists. Unit labor costs surged 12.2% following a revised 9.8% increase.
Output slumped at a 38.9% pace, the most in quarterly records back to 1947, while hours worked plummeted at a 43% pace, also the most since then.
Despite the record drop in output in the second quarter as a result of the pandemic, productivity improved as hours worked fell even more. The data on efficiency and cost of labor will probably remain volatile as the economy rebounds from the sharpest downturn since the 1940s and businesses operations pick up.
From a year earlier, productivity rose 2.2%. Unit labor costs increased 5.7% year-over-year. The report also showed inflation-adjusted hourly compensation rose at a 24.8% annual pace during the quarter after an 8.1% increase.

The Philly Fed's quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters predicted growth in the current third quarter will come in at a 19.1% annualized rate, nearly double the previous forecast for a 10.6% expansion from July through September. The economy, in recession since February, contracted at a 32.9% rate in the second quarter.
The survey of 35 forecasters predicted the growth rate will slow sharply from there, with the expansion in the fourth quarter seen at a 5.8% rate, down from forecasts for 6.5% in the regional Fed bank's survey three months ago.
The forecasters see the unemployment rate dropping more than previously thought in the current quarter but that fewer jobs will be created per month. 
The third-quarter unemployment rate is seen at 10%, down from an earlier projection of 12.9%. For the fourth quarter, unemployment will decline to 9.5% versus an earlier estimate of 11%. The jobless rate was 10.2% in July. 

Job growth will average 2.07 million a month in the current quarter, down from May's forecast of 2.33 million, and will drop quickly from there to less than 400,000 a month in the fourth quarter. In May the forecasters had seen job growth averaging 900,000 a month in the final three months of the year. Job growth in July totaled 1.76 million.

The University of Michigan’s preliminary sentiment index increased 0.3 point to 72.8, near April’s pandemic low of 71.8 that was the worst since 2011, according to data released Friday. The median estimate from economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a decrease to 72.
The gauge of current conditions fell 0.3 point to 82.5, while a measure of expectations ticked up 0.6 point to 66.5.
A measure of the five-year economic outlook fell to the lowest since 2014, in a sign that consumers expect the pandemic will weigh on jobs and incomes for some time despite an initial snapback. A stalemate in Washington over additional aid is also coloring views, with confidence in economic policies at the lowest since President Donald Trump entered office, according to the report.
“The policy gridlock has acted to increase uncertainty and heightened the need for precautionary funds to offset lapses in economic relief programs and to hedge against fears about the persistence and spread of the coronavirus as the school year gets underway,’’ Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said in a statement.
Data released earlier Friday showed gains in consumer spending slowed in July. Jobless claims figures on Thursday indicated improvement in the labor market, though applications for benefits remained well above pre-crisis levels.
The Michigan report also showed a gap in inflation expectations between high-income Americans and those with lower incomes, who are being pinched more by rising food prices. People in the bottom third of incomes expected prices to rise 3.5% in the year ahead, compared with 2.5% for those in the top third.
Democrats and Republicans continued to be sharply divided on sentiment, and the gauge rose in August among independents and Republicans, while it was almost unchanged for Democrats.
The survey covers responses received through Aug. 12. The final report for the month will be issued Aug. 28.

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has in recent weeks delayed approvals for mobile phone components and televisions, jeopardizing the plans of firms such as Xiaomi as well as Oppo, industry sources in India and China said.
BIS Director General Pramod Kumar Tiwari did not respond to requests for comment. China's commerce ministry and the foreign ministry did not immediately respond.
Xiaomi declined to comment, while Oppo did not respond. 
The most serious border tension in decades between the Asian giants has hurt already hurt their economic ties and Indian officials expect the damage to get worse. 
""The relationship has gone south dramatically,"" said one official, adding India was unlikely to immediately approve several investments proposals from Chinese companies.
""We cannot do business as usual.""
India had mandated the screening of investment flows from China in April but the government has been slow in approving any since the clash.
India's trade ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
STALLED APPROVALS
A senior Indian official said the government was working on a new standards policy - likely to be announced by the end of August - in a bid to target low-quality products from China and elsewhere.
But those deliberations have stalled approvals for even branded Chinese companies' hoping to step up sales, one Indian industry source said.
""The products are not getting clearance as quality standards are being upgraded because of which many product lines could be affected,"" said the official, who declined to be identified.
Chinese smartphone brands, including Oppo and Xiaomi, account for eight of every 10 smartphones sold in India. While the two companies assemble most of their models in India, several components are imported from China.
Modi has in recent weeks called for a ""self-reliant India"", urging industry to focus on boosting domestic production.
Under the BIS's registration scheme, certain electronic goods - whether imported or locally made - need to meet India's standards. After companies get their products tested in a certified laboratory, BIS approves the applications.
A source briefed at a smartphone maker in China, which has been affected by delays, said BIS applications were typically processed within 15 days but had now ""been left in limbo"".
As of Friday, 643 applications were pending for registration, with 394 pending for more than 20 days, the BIS website said. It did not say how many were from Chinese companies.
The CP-UP Certification Technology Service Co, an agency based in China's Guangzhou city which helps clients with such clearances, told its customers in an Aug. 4 notice that BIS had stopped processing applications from ""non-Indian manufacturers"" from July 23 ""due to the trade war between China and India"".
It was not immediately clear whether imports from countries other than China were also being held up.

A BIS official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said additional checks were being made in consultation with several ministries before clearing any applications.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors face a classic 'dictator dilemma' in Belarus - hold on to securities that benefit from the status quo in a brutal regime, or sell them and sever their ties - but which way they go may depend largely on Vladimir Putin's Russia.
Belarus's President Alexander Lukashenko, dubbed ""Europe's last dictator"" and in power since 1994, claimed victory in a presidential election last weekend with around 80% of the vote.
The announcement has triggered days of widespread protests and brought threats of stringent Western sanctions. 
While an end to Lukashenko's rule could be a long-term benefit for the country, it would also come with the risk of an immediate debt crisis that would hurt major investors.
Despite a violent crackdown on thousands of protesters, foreign money managers have so far shown little inclination to sell their Belarus bonds. And as recently as June they flocked to buy the country's new dollar issues that paid juicy 5.7%-6.4% yields.
On Thursday, however, the pressure on Lukashenko appeared to intensify, and BlueBay's veteran emerging market strategist Tim Ash wrote that the situation felt like Ukraine in 2014 at the time of its 'Colour Revolution'.
With workers from state-run Belarus factories now joining protests and Russia's foreign ministry saying it thought foreign forces were destabilising Belarus, Ash said Lukashenko's days could be numbered.
""The question now is what Lukashenko does - does he double down on the use of force, or head to the exits in a helicopter?"" 
Belarusian authorities released detained demonstrators on Friday after issuing a rare public apology in a bid to quell the protests, while European Union foreign ministers meet later on Friday to discuss possible new sanctions.
While no respectable investor would condone brutal police crackdowns, election rigging or political intimidation, supersized firms such as Ashmore, JP Morgan Asset Management, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management and Franklin Templeton all own Belarus bonds according to Refinitiv data. None of them would comment on their positions. 
Some investors said the upheaval has only added to Belarus's woes. The IMF already forecasts a 6% economic slump this year and with more than 90% of its international debt in dollars, a currency collapse may open the door to default - especially with $2.5 billion of bond payments due by the end of the year.
Another major risk is that Lukashenko could throw in the towel and Russian President Vladimir Putin could pull his support and financial backing that remains in place despite worsening ties of late between the two leaders.
Russia buys around 40% of Belarus's exports, provides it with billions in bilateral loans and has traditionally given substantial subsidies through preferential oil prices, estimated by the Centre for European Reform to have been worth $100 billion between 2005-15.

VITAL BACKSTOP
Union Investments' portfolio manager Sergey Dergachev said Russia's reaction was key with ""an impact on bond prices and sentiment since it is material for (the) future economic and political trajectory of Belarus.""
He holds some Belarus bonds and while he trimmed his exposure and is watching what Lukashenko, opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya and EU do next, he reckons ""the risk of sanctions which might be really harmful for investors, i.e a ban on (buying) newly issued Belarus debt, is very, very low"".
In any case, the decision could take weeks or months as it requires all 27 EU members to agree. 
Graphic: Belarus foreign exchange reserves set to fall https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprkagjve/Pasted%20image%201597131076882.png 
So is it all pointing to a debt crisis? Well that depends.
Rating agency Fitch sees the government's budget deficit ballooning to 4.3% of GDP and debt-to-GDP jumping to 50% from 42% last year, though it could climb higher if the rouble capitulates. 
Even at current prices, $2.5 billion of upcoming bond payments could leave the government with little over $7 billion in hard currency reserves by the end of the year - only enough to cover its financing needs for around two months in a worst case scenario.
Nick Eisinger, principal, fixed income emerging markets at Vanguard said the country faced a $2 billion-$3 billion external shortfall, making it a priority to secure a delayed tranche of IMF aid. 
""I just wonder without the Russian financial backstop where Belarus should trade?"", BlueBay's Ash said.

The Chinese territory's government revised its full year gross domestic product (GDP) forecast to a contraction of 6% to 8% from the earlier estimate of a 4% to 7% contraction.
Its economy shrank 9% in the second quarter, the fourth straight quarter of year-on-year decline for the Asian financial hub. The contraction was in line with advance estimates released by the government and was just a shade better than the 9.1% fall in the preceding quarter.
""Hong Kong's short-term economic outlook is still highly uncertain,"" government economist Andrew Au said in a statement. 
""The recent surge of COVID-19 infections and the resultant tightening of social distancing measures, and austere labour market conditions will weigh heavily on private consumption in the coming weeks,"" Au said, adding any recovery will depend on how fast local infections can be brought under control. 
The overall economic situation had stabilised somewhat during the quarter, especially in May and June when the coronavirus was largely under control. But a resurgence in the number of cases recently is likely to produce more damage.
""If the current wave of local infections can be contained within a short time and barring any further sharp deterioration in the external environment, economic performance for 2020 as a whole can hopefully fall within the upper half of the range forecast,"" Au added.
Hong Kong reported 48 additional coronavirus cases on Friday, bringing total infections to more than 4,300 people.
On a quarterly basis, the economy contracted a seasonally adjusted 0.1% for the April-June period, after a revised 5.5% drop in the first quarter.
NO IMMEDIATE HOPE 
The resurgence of infections is weighing on consumer and tourism-related sectors.

1151,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 06:43AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday, August 14th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Fears of a second wave of Covid-19 in Europe spread as the U.K. imposes a quarantine on travelers from France and Holland. Unrest in Belarus and fears of possible Russian intervention add to the nerves to send European stocks tumbling and weigh on U.S. futures, too. July retail sales are expected to confirm a flattening out of the economic recovery. The publisher of Fortnite sues Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google after it dropped the game from their app stores in a move to defend their sales commissions.  And the Senate has gone on vacation rather than wait for the House and the administration to agree on a stimulus package. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, August 14th.
1. European markets tumble on Covid fears, Belarus unrest
European stock markets fell sharply after the U.K. imposed a two-week quarantine on people arriving from France and the Netherlands, in response to recent sharp increases in the rate of new Coronavirus infections in those countries.
The quarantine announcement overshadowed a further loosening of restrictions on domestic business in the U.K.
Adding to the nerves was a wave of strikes across Belarus in protest at the alleged rigging of last weekend’s presidential election by incumbent Alexander Lukashenko. His opponent, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, was forced into exile earlier this week by the country’s security services. EU foreign ministers are meeting later Friday to discuss the issue, mindful of the risk of Russian intervention
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 was down 1.6%, also hit by figures showing that eurozone GDP fell by 12.1% in the second quarter. The worst hit stock market was non-eurozone Poland, which borders Belarus to the west.  
2. Retail sales data due as Senate goes on vacation
Is the U.S. economic recovery intact or not? After much debate over whether jobless claims data on Thursday gave a too flattering picture of the labor market, the U.S. is set to release retail sales data for July at 8:30.
The figures are unlikely to show much sign of consumer sentiment weakening ahead of the expiry of enhanced unemployment benefits at the end of the month, as the cut-off date for the sample fell before the deadlock in Congress over the fourth stimulus package became a major talking point.
Even so, sales are expected to have risen only 1.9% from June, consistent with a pattern visible everywhere in recent data that shows the rebound in activity flattening out.
Overnight, Chinese data showed industrial production falling short of expectations for the first time since lockdowns were lifted, while retail sales still remained below last year’s levels.
3. Stocks set to open lower
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower ahead of the retail sales release, hit not only by the news out of Europe, but also by the continued game of hardball between House Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and the administration.
The Senate adjourned for its summer recess on Thursday, after negotiators made no progress in bridging the gap between the respective proposals on what to include (or not) in the next round of economic relief measures. Senate Leader Mitch McConnell said the chamber could be recalled for a vote if necessary.
By 6:30 AM ET, the Dow futures contract was down 140 points or 0.5%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 0.1%.
4. Fortnite publisher takes on Big Tech
Epic Games, the publisher of blockbuster video game Fortnite, sued Google and Apple after the two tech giants Fortnite from their app stores in an effort to defend their hefty commissions for in-game purchases.
Epic had tried to roll out a new way of making in-app purchases to avoid paying hefty fees to the two companies (The Wall Street Journal reported those commission are 30%).
The move comes against a backdrop of increasing scrutiny of the tech giants’ policies with regard to control of their operating sytems. The EU, which has already fined Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for abusing its control of the Android system to squeeze out third-party apps,  opened an antitrust investigation into possible abuse of the iPhone App Store by Apple in June.
5. Oil prices fall on U.K. quarantine news
Crude oil prices fell as the latest Covid-19 developments in Europe pointed to a fresh hit to fuel demand.
By 6:40 AM, U.S. crude futures were down 0.5% at $42.02 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent was down 0.4% at $44.77 a barrel.
France is the world’s biggest tourist destination country, and the U.K.’s new restrictions triggered sharp falls in European airline stocks on Friday.

1152,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",Column: Debt mountain meets population cliff - Mike Dolan,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - Hopes the world economy can grow itself out of the mountain of debt being accumulated during this year's pandemic shock may have failed to factor in the uncomfortable prospect of a peaking population within the next 50 years.
The sweeping COVID-19 pandemic, related lockdowns and resulting historic recessions have forced governments and companies around the world to borrow to bridge the gap, and left central banks with little choice but to keep debt servicing levels affordable.
The International Monetary Fund in June estimated public debt as a share of gross domestic product in advanced economies on aggregate will now shoot to record highs above 130% this year and next, topping levels seen shortly after World War Two.
Even by the end of the first quarter of 2020, the pandemic-related scramble for credit had pushed total government, corporate and household debt more than 10 percentage points higher to a record 331% of GDP, or some $258 trillion, according to data published by the Institute of International Finance. The figure for so-called ""mature markets"" is as high as 392%.
The IIF also points out that due to COVID-19-related lockdowns corporate debt has soared, with $4.6 trillion of bonds sold in the second quarter alone compared with quarterly averages last year of $2.8 trillion.
With the United States Treasury conducting record sized 10- and 30-year bond auctions this week alone, no one's in any doubt there is a lot of debt piling up.
The U.S. Congressional Budget Office in May updated its long-range forecasts for government debt held by the public and reckoned that at $116 trillion by 2050, the public debt ratio was set to more double to 180% by then.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) meanwhile notes that the ""central scenario"" of Britain's official fiscal watchdog shows a 2070 government debt/GDP ratio of 418%. During the austerity drive just five years ago, that same 2070 forecast was just 87%.
""It’s almost inconceivable that we’ll reach that point, so something will likely have to give,"" said Deutsche strategist Jim Reid, opining on options from cutbacks to age-related pension and healthcare costs, to higher taxes, faster inflation, central bank bond buying or even - whisper it - default.
""Economic growth could bail us out but this will be tough given demographics.""
POPULATION CLIFF
Those long-run debt projections just collided with some equally alarming population statistics.
A new academic study of global fertility rates and their long-term demographic implications published in Britain's The Lancet magazine last month showed the global population is now set to peak at 9.7 billion around 2064 before falling by more than 9% by the end of the century.
While that may be a relief for the environment, it has seismic economic growth and public debt implications.
Populations in some 23 of the 195 countries in the study - including Japan, Spain, Portugal, Thailand and Ukraine - are expected to halve by the end of the century and China could see a drop of 48%. Another 33 countries are seen declining by between 25% and 50%. Both China and India should expect to see their numbers peak before 2050.
Add in ageing in countries forecast to see 25% population declines and the ratio of those over 80 to those under 15 is expected to balloon to 1.5 from just 0.16 now.
""These population shifts have economic and fiscal consequences that will be extremely challenging,"" the study said. ""All other things being equal, the decline in the numbers of working-aged adults alone will reduce GDP growth rates.""
Of course, relative changes between countries are crucial.
Flattered by immigration, the population of the United States is expected to grow until mid-century followed by a moderate decline of less than 10% of the peak by 2100. In terms of GDP rankings, that would see China rise to the top by 2035 but be superseded once more by the United States in 2098.
For the United States at least, where some argue a mini-youth boom is already underway, the near-term debt situation is workable as long as the Federal Reserve keeps the cost down.
""The math is not that challenging,"" said Barings strategist Christopher Smart, adding that if net borrowing costs can be capped at 1.5%, then just 1.5% GDP growth and 2% inflation could see the debt ratio shrink by 2% a year.
More worrying, he said, is the long-term willingness to pay.
And if that becomes a concern in the biggest economy in the world with a relatively manageable debt scenario, not to mention the ability to print the world's dominant reserve currency, then there is an even bigger headache elsewhere.

1153,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 04:46AM ET</span>","For China's landlords, rent-to-riches dreams fade in red flag for fragile economy","By Ryan Woo and Liangping Gao
BEIJING (Reuters) - Not yet 30, Beijing office worker Li thought she was already on her way up China's private property ladder with two apartments bought and rented out. Then came the new coronavirus, jobless tenants leaving town and a rent falloff. 
She's one of millions of Chinese landlords who have bought apartments to let in a highway to the country's growing middle class, many now facing a first slump in rental income. 
Analysts say there's little prospect of widespread mortgage defaults for now, and property prices continue to grow, albeit more slowly. But the rental woes underline China's economic fragility, with the landlord legions already cutting back on spending amid their gloom.
Li, who declined to give her full name, said she had to almost halve the rent at one of her apartments between February and May to hang on to a tenant, while her own salary was slashed 25% as her employer made coronavirus cutbacks.
""I must pay the rent of my room in Beijing, and monthly mortgages for the two apartments,"" she said. 
Rents in 20 major cities fell 2.33% in July from the same month year earlier, according to property data provider Zhuge House Hunter - the fourth consecutive month of decline in a market that's been buoyant for years. 
The sector remains opaque with no national database setting out who owns which buildings and limited historical tracking data.

https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-ECONOMY/CHART/nmovalgqjpa/chart.png
CONSUMPTION DEFERRED
Amid the strain wrought on China's services and manufacturing sectors by the spread of COVID-19 earlier this year, first to be laid off were migrant labourers, prime takers of small rental apartments. 
White-collar workers followed, while fresh college graduates from the provinces who would normally flood into cities have struggled to find jobs. All that has weighed on consumption by both tenants and deeper-pocketed landlords.
Even demand for short-term accommodation has waned, depriving landlords of one alternative. In June, the number of Chinese properties that had at least one booked night fell 29% from a year earlier, according to data from analytics firm AirDNA, which tracks bookings on Airbnb and Vrbo. 
""Two groups ... suffer the most,"" said Yuan Chengjian, vice president of Zhuge House Hunter. ""One is long-term rental firms ... the other is investors who buy properties through high leverage financing, because they pay off part of their mortgages with rent.""
Luo Shuzhen, 50, with 80 rooms to sublet in two buildings in the southern industrial city of Dongguan, said tenant numbers have dropped 30% this year. She's now postponing plans to furnish an apartment she bought last year.
""It's hard to say how long the epidemic would last, so I'm not sure whether I can maintain the rental business in the second half,"" said Luo, who runs a convenience store.

https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-ECONOMY/CHART/rlgvdnbgovo/chart.png
DEFAULTS UPTICK
Like Luo, other landlords that Reuters spoke to were looking at reducing spending. China's retail sales fell for the seventh month in July, official data on Friday showed.
But mortgage defaults remain rare for now: China's overall non-performing loan ratio stood at just 2.1% on average as of end-June.
Regulators do not give a breakdown on souring mortgages, but China's residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) market offers a clue to trends. 
About 3% of mortgages are securitised by banks, and delinquency in payment of some securitised mortgages inched higher earlier this year, although defaults remained below 0.10% of outstanding mortgages. 
""Half of the transactions in the securitisation market use 90 days as the definition for default, while the other half use 180 days,"" said Tracy Wan, senior director of Asia-Pacific structured finance at Fitch Ratings. ""For those who use 180 days, you'd have a longer time to recognise defaults, and that number is still going up.""
For Beijing office worker Li, the time to seek assistance in keeping her property dreams in one piece has already come. 

""I even asked my father for help - and I'm nearly 30 years old!"" she said.

Europe's largest economy has been recovering since May thanks to the easing of restrictions imposed to slow the spread of coronavirus, the ministry said in its monthly report.
While a rapid improvement in Germany's mighty industrial sector is continuing, this will lose steam due to weak demand from other countries that are still being battered by the pandemic, the ministry said.
The ministry said a further economic upturn would depend to a large extent on how the pandemic develops in Germany and abroad.

Sixteen of 20 economists responding to a Reuters poll said they see Bank Indonesia holding the benchmark 7-day reverse repurchase rate  at 4.00% when it concludes its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.
The four cuts this year have resulted in a 100 basis point drop in the benchmark rate which have come on top of cuts totalling 100 basis points in 2019.
""We have no more rate cuts in our base case,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts wrote in a note to clients, noting a change of tone in Governor Perry Warjiyo's forward guidance after last month's rate cut. He did not say there was room for more easing as he had done previously and his comments favoured expanding liquidity.
Citibank analysts pointed to falls in money market rates beyond the central bank's rate cuts. That amounted to ""covert easing"", they said and could mean BI was not keen on lowering the benchmark rate due to balance of payments risks. 
Four economists polled predicted another 25 basis point reduction.
Hit by the pandemic, Southeast Asia's biggest economy shrank 5.32% in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier, the first quarterly contraction in more than two decades.
DBS economist Radhika Rao, among those expecting a cut next week, said benign inflation gave BI room to ease and that a cut would help protect the economy from further risks to growth.
While the government has forecast flat growth for the economy this year, some independent analysts believe GDP will contract - which would mark the first time for the resource-rich country since the Asian financial crisis in 1998.
Last month, BI and the government agreed on a $40 billion fiscal deficit financing scheme that involves BI buying $28 billion of bonds that offer no interest. The central bank has also injected liquidity into the banking system through cuts to reserve requirements.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's economy likely shrank by a new record in April-June, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, as the coronavirus pandemic battered tourism and domestic spending, pointing to a long road to recovery.
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, which is heavily reliant on tourism and exports, probably contracted 13.3% in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to the poll.
That compares with a record contraction of 12.5% in the second quarter of 1998, during the Asian financial crisis, and against the March quarter's 1.8% shrinkage.
On a quarterly basis, gross domestic product (GDP) likely declined a seasonally adjusted 11.4% in the June quarter, the deepest fall on record, compared with 2.2% shrinkage in the previous quarter.
""A double digit contraction is on the cards, likely marking the nadir for the down cycle,"" said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS in Singapore.
Any recovery will struggle for momentum due to a slower turnaround in domestic activity concurrently with a collapse in trade and tourism, she said.
""Economic recovery will be slow as long as the outbreak in other countries is not over as tourism will not get back,"" said economist Thammarat Kitisiripat at Tisco group.
The central bank expects activity to take at least two years to return to the pre-pandemic level.
Without any local transmissions for over two months, Thailand has allowed businesses to reopen but it has not lifted a ban on foreign visitors, which fell to zero in April-June, with travel bubble plans shelved.
Exports have declined due to weak global demand and a strong baht  while anti-government protests hurt sentiment.
The National Economic and Social Development Council, which compiles GDP data, forecast the economy would shrink 5%-6% this year and will give a new projection on Monday. The poll saw a 7.5% GDP contraction, the worst since 1998's record 7.6% drop.

The government expects the economy to post near flat growth this year due to the pandemic, which has infected over 132,000 people and caused nearly 6,000 deaths, the highest death toll in Southeast Asia. Last year, the economy grew 5%.
Widodo said accelerating reform of the health sector was a top priority, along with strengthening food supply chains, including with a newly planned food estate on Borneo island.
Under energy reforms, Widodo highlighted plans to slash expensive oil imports by using fuel made from palm oil. 
Indonesia's Pertamina produced a first batch of biodiesel made fully from palm oil last month and is set to produce 1,000 barrels of the fuel at its Dumai refinery.
The so-called D100 would absorb a minimum of one million tonnes of farmer-produced palm for 20,000 barrels of production capacity per day, Widodo said, without giving a timeline.
Indonesia currently has a mandatory use of biodiesel with 30% palm oil content.

The president also stressed a need to push forward the downstream processing of raw materials including converting coal into gas and nickel ore into ferro nickel and stainless steel, as part of government efforts to create jobs.

1161,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 02:05AM ET</span>","Japan exports to post double-digit fall again, machinery orders seen up: Reuters poll","By Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's July exports are expected to have recorded a double-digit decline for the fifth straight month as the coronavirus pandemic hit global demand, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
The poll also showed machinery orders in June rose for a second straight month and core consumer prices probably grew for the first time in four months in July. 
But analysts say weak global demand and restrictions on business activities in some major economies due to a resurgence in infections suggest any recovery in the world's third-largest economy will likely only be moderate. 
Exports in July were projected to fall 21.0% from a year earlier, less than a 26.2% tumble in June, the poll of 16 economists showed.
Imports, however, were expected to have dropped by a sharper 22.8% from a year earlier after a 14.4% fall the previous month, resulting in a trade deficit of 77.6 billion yen ($725.84 million), the poll found.
""Global reopening of economic activities probably helped the nation's exports to escape from the worst period,"" said Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist at Japan Research Institute
""But the pace of global economic recovery will likely remain modest due to uncertainty over the containment of the coronavirus. Exports likely tumbled year-on-year."" 
The poll also showed machinery orders, a leading indicator of capital expenditure, rose 2.0% in June from the previous month, after a 1.7% gain in May.
Analysts said the reopening of businesses after a nationwide shutdown supported core machinery orders, but worsening corporate profits and uncertainty over the outlook would probably limit the pace of recovery. 
The government is due to publish trade data and machinery orders at 8:50 a.m. on Wednesday (2350 GMT Tuesday).
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, likely rose 0.1% in July from a year earlier, helped by a pick-up in oil prices and some recovery in consumer demand, the poll showed.

The CPI data will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Friday.

The growth pace of exports and imports in the resource-rich country had improved in June after many countries eased coronavirus-induced restrictions, although demand was yet to return to pre-pandemic levels.
The median forecast from 14 analysts for exports to fall 16.65% on-year in July, compared with the previous month's 2.28% annual expansion - which was the first growth since February.
Import contraction was seen accelerating to 22.48% last month, following June's 6.36% drop, which economists said reflected weak domestic demand.

Southeast Asia's largest economy had likely booked a $680 million surplus last month, compared with a $1.27 billion surplus in June. Forecasts were widely ranged, from a deficit $410 million to as much as $3.8 billion surplus.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy will contract more than previously expected and suffer mild deflation during the current fiscal year, analysts predict, underscoring the fragile nature of the recovery from the devastating coronavirus pandemic.
Analysts also see renewed, escalating tensions between the United States and China as an additional source of concern for the world's third-largest economy, which is heavily reliant on exports, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
""Economic activity will continue to face restrictions from social distancing measures"" needed to prevent the spread of the virus, said Taro Saito, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute.
""Japan's economy will likely rebound next fiscal year but won't recoup the huge losses incurred this year,"" he said.
The economy is forecast to shrink 5.6% in the current fiscal year to next March, the poll of 32 economists showed, more than a 5.3% contraction projected last month. In a worst case scenario it will shrink 8.0%.
The downgrade came as many analysts revised their forecasts for April-June gross domestic product (GDP) to a 27% contraction - last month's worst case forecast - from a nearly 24% drop projected in July.
The government will publish April-June GDP data on Monday.
Japan's economy will grow just 3.3% in the following year beginning in April 2021, the Aug. 4-13 poll showed, unchanged from the previous poll in July. 
Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile fresh food but includes energy costs, will fall 0.3% this fiscal year and rebound just 0.2% next year, according to the poll.
With the economy in deflation and its 2% inflation target proving increasingly elusive, the Bank of Japan's next move will be an expansion of stimulus, said a majority of those polled.
""The battle against the coronavirus will be a long one. Governments and central banks can't end steps to combat the pandemic until an effective vaccine becomes available,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa securities.
JAPAN FACING U.S.-CHINA FEUD
A recent sharp deterioration in U.S.-China relations could complicate the outlook, as the world's two largest economies disagree on issues such as trade, technology and the pandemic.
Asked how the conflict between the two nations will affect Japan's economy, about 90% of economists surveyed said it would have a negative impact.
Over 80% of respondents also said Japanese companies would face adverse effects if Washington and Beijing move toward creating their own economic zones, which would mark a retreat of globalisation.
""Economic blocs led by those two countries, or de-globalisation, would lower global productivity growth. That would have a negative impact on Japan's potential growth and Japanese firms' productivity growth,"" said Hiroshi Ugai, chief economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Securities Japan.

1165,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 12:10AM ET</span>",A faltering U.S.-China trade deal is now the nations' strongest link,"By Andrea Shalal, David Lawder and Yawen Chen
WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - Top U.S. and Chinese trade officials are expected to recommit to a Phase 1 trade deal during a review on Saturday, even though China's promised purchases of U.S. exports are far behind schedule.
Current and former U.S. government officials and trade experts in both countries say the Phase 1 deal, signed in January after nearly two years of tit-for-tat tariffs and angry rhetoric, is the one area where the world's two largest economies are still cooperating. 
The Trump administration has sanctioned companies and individuals linked to a security crackdown in Hong Kong and human rights, banned a Chinese owned video app, penalized Chinese academics and closed Beijing's consulate in Houston in recent months. 
Beijing has responded by closing the U.S. consulate in Chengdu and sanctioning some members of Congress.
Despite the escalating conflict, the Phase 1 trade deal won't be dismantled, U.S. officials say. 
""They have said they intend to implement the plan and we are engaged with them,"" White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Thursday. ""We have big differences with China on other matters, but regarding the Phase 1 trade deal, we are engaging."" 
Chinese trade advisors say the slowing of both economies because of coronavirus-related lockdowns has made it difficult to meet purchase targets, but they don't expect the White House to walk away. 
""Being able to sit down and communicate with each other is a good thing,"" said a Chinese state think tank economist who has advised Beijing on the trade deal, while cautioning there was little optimism about further trade breakthroughs.
""It's hard for things to get even worse, while a best case scenario is hard to achieve,"" said the economist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""How can flowers grow in such a bad environment?""
China is falling far short of a promised additional $77 billion in purchases of U.S. farm and manufactured products, energy and services, although it has ramped up purchases of U.S. farm goods including soybeans and corn in recent weeks. 
Imports of farm goods have been lower than 2017 levels, far behind the 50% increase needed to meet the 2020 target of $36.5 billion. 
Beijing has bought only 5% of the energy products needed to meet the Phase 1 first year goal of $25.3 billion.
How to close or explain away this gap will be the biggest challenge for U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He during Saturday's video call. 
 BEST  (NYSE:BEST) OF A BAD SITUATION 
Trade experts said there is little political upside for U.S. President Donald Trump to abandon the deal at this stage, which would admit one of his biggest trade initiatives - already being hammered by Democratic rival Joe Biden - had failed.
And even some Trump administration officials have been wary of reigniting a tariff war that would roil markets and likely knock down the S&P 500 (SPX), which traded close to record highs this week. 
""At the moment, the agreement serves the interests of the Trump administration and Chinese leaders,"" said former acting USTR Miriam Sapiro, now a managing director at communications firm Sard Verbinnen, adding the requirements set in the deal were ""never realistic."" 
Trump, who has said the trade deal no longer means as much to him because of China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, has expressed support for the deal this week, saying it should continue and purchases should surge in 2021..
Stephen Vaughn, former USTR general counsel and a legal architect of punitive tariffs on Chinese goods, said compliance with the deal also benefits China by keeping its U.S. relationship from deteriorating further. Now that its economy is recovering strongly from the coronavirus pandemic, Beijing has little excuse not to ramp up its purchases, he added. 
""I don't see what China would gain from a failure to comply. My guess is that will not happen,"" said Vaughn, a trade partner with the King and Spalding law firm in Washington. 
Claire Reade, a former USTR official and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the agreement does offer some incremental progress for U.S. firms seeking access to the lucrative Chinese market.
""If the administration lets the Phase 1 deal die, it becomes difficult to justify the pain caused by the lengthy trade war,"" she wrote in an essay this week.

Nearly 90% of firms surveyed by the U.S.-China Business Council have a positive view of the trade deal, but only 7% say its benefits outweigh the costs of tariffs incurred along the way.

Last month, the ministry said the hiring of foreign labour would be limited to the construction, agriculture and plantation sectors, a move to increase employment opportunities for locals affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
The ministry said more than 67,000 local workers and over 4,700 foreign workers had lost their jobs as of July.
""However, there were some employers who claim to still need a number of foreign workers and urged the government to withdraw the freeze on recruitment of new foreign workers,"" Minister Saravanan Murugan said in the statement.
Saravanan urged employers to prioritise filling job vacancies with local workers before considering re-employing foreign workers who are still in Malaysia with a valid work permit. The foreign workers, if rehired, must work in the same sectors they were previously employed in.
Malaysia hosts about 2.1 million documented foreign workers, according to government estimates.

""The idea of breaking the ceiling exists. What's the problem?"" the right-wing leader said on a weekly Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) live webcast to his supporters.
In December 2016, Congress passed a 20-year ""ceiling"" to slow public spending growth, control a ballooning budget deficit and bring public finances back to long-term health.
The constitutional amendment limits the growth in federal government expenditure to the previous year's rate of inflation. 
But with Brazil's economy on track for its biggest annual crash ever due to the coronavirus pandemic, the need for fiscal stimulus has never been greater to get the economy moving and save jobs.
Next year's budget is capped at 1.485 trillion reais ($275 billion), only 31 billion reais more than this year. That would give very little room to maneuver even in normal times.
Despite warnings by Economy Minister Paulo Guedes that failure to roll back this year's emergency spending will spook investors, Bolsonaro is under pressure from others in his cabinet to keep the fiscal taps running to strengthen the fragile economy.
""The ceiling is the ceiling, the floor climbs each year and we have less and less resources to do anything,"" Bolsonaro said.
He said the Infrastructure Ministry had too small a budget and there are projects that need funding in Brazil's poorer northeast region, where voters could decide his re-election chances in 2022.
Bolsonaro said the emergency spending in the pandemic has already broken the ceiling for this year and he is being asked to spend more.

""We are discussing this because everyone wants it,"" he said. ""The market has to give us a break too.

Japan will set next year's property tax, or the tax companies pay for the land they own, based on land prices measured in January.
This has raised concern companies will face a bigger tax burden despite an expected fall in land prices blamed on the pandemic, which has ravaged Japan's economy since then.
""Companies' ability to pay tax has fallen, so we must come up with ways to (avoid) forcing them to pay higher tax. Given the pandemic, we need to avoid higher tax as much as we can,"" Amari was quoted as saying on the property tax in an interview that ran on Friday.
Amari's panel advises the government on tax policies and plays a key role in defining how to use tax measures to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic.
Amari dismissed the idea, proposed by some lawmakers, that Japan cut the 10% rate for the sales tax - or the tax consumers pay each time for purchases - to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic.

""It's a tax that is linked to Japan's social welfare system,"" Amari said of the consumption tax. ""It shouldn't be used as a policy tool (to spur growth),"" he was quoted as saying, adding that distributing payouts to households and companies was an easier way to ease the pain from COVID-19.

""We have big differences with China on other matters, but regarding the Phase 1 trade deal, we are engaging,"" Kudlow said.
Amid the coronavirus pandemic, China's purchases of U.S. farm and manufactured goods, energy and services have gotten off to a slow start and are well behind the pace needed for a promised increase of $77 billion this year and $200 billion over two years.

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is among those who appeared at a briefing on the economy for U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, his campaign disclosed on Thursday.
Yellen, who ran the U.S. central bank from 2014 to 2018, appeared by video at the first joint economic briefing attended by both Biden and his new running mate, Senator Kamala Harris.
Harris joined the regular briefings that Biden takes on both the public health and economic consequences of the coronavirus crisis. Both sat at separate desks in a makeshift television studio installed in a hotel ballroom in Biden's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware.
Yellen, an academic who had specialized in labor economics, was appointed the first woman Fed chair by Democratic President Barack Obama. She placed an emphasis on unemployment but also raised interest rates as the U.S. economy recovered from the 2008-2009 financial crisis.
Trump replaced her with Jerome Powell, who had reversed course on interest rates by the time the economy began faltering under the weight of the coronavirus pandemic.
It is unclear what Yellen is telling Biden in private, and Biden declined to say when asked by a reporter. But the former vice president has proposed broad changes at the Fed, including requiring them to regularly report on what they are doing to close economic gaps that exist along racial lines.
Biden said racial economic gaps were among the topics at Thursday's briefing.
""Dr. Yellen is not an adviser to the Biden/Harris campaign,"" said Shannon Meraw, a spokeswoman at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank where Yellen now works. ""However, as a Brookings scholar she may provide nonpartisan public policy analysis and recommendations to public officials and candidates for public office.""
A Biden campaign official said Yellen is not an adviser to the campaign but an expert briefing the candidates, though the nature of that distinction was not clear.
Last month, Yellen told a House of Representatives subcommittee that ""it would be a catastrophe"" not to extend a federal unemployment insurance supplement that recently expired as congressional negotiations on coronavirus relief stalled. She cited the income support for people laid off, who she said are ""disproportionately low-wage workers and minorities.""

She also dismissed criticism largely from Republicans that high unemployment insurance payouts are discouraging people from returning to work.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. Republican senators on Thursday asked the Federal Trade Commission for an investigation of video-sharing app TikTok's consumer data collection and processing practices.
The request was in a letter by Senator Jerry Moran, chair of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Senator John Thune, chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet.
The senators sought specific answers from the FTC related to a Wall Street Journal report that described TikTok's undisclosed collection and transmission of data from millions of U.S. consumers until November 2019. 
""There are allegations that TikTok discretely collected media access control (MAC) addresses, commonly used for advertisement targeting purposes ... through November 2019,” said the letter, which was addressed to FTC Chairman Joseph Simons.
A spokeswoman for the FTC declined comment.
The letter is the latest example of Washington's mounting scrutiny of a Chinese-owned company over national security concerns. Under a Chinese law introduced in 2017, companies have an obligation to support and cooperate in China's national intelligence work. 
U.S. President Donald Trump on Aug. 6 signed an executive order prohibiting transactions with TikTok if its Chinese parent ByteDance does not reach a deal to divest it within 45 days.
Earlier this week, Reuters reported Trump's order could prevent U.S. app stores from offering TikTok and make advertising on the platform illegal.
A company spokeswoman said the current TikTok app does not collect MAC addresses.

(Reuters) - Households with children are under severe economic strain and at greater risk of needing to dip into savings, missing a rent payment or not having enough food to eat during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report published by the New York Federal Reserve on Thursday. 
Single parents households in particular, are losing jobs, income and health insurance at higher rates than other households with children. For example, 23.2% of single-parent households said the head of the household faced a permanent or temporary layoff in May or June, compared to 12.9% of households with children and 9.2% of households without children. 
Households with single parents were also more likely to depend on help from friends, family and food banks. Some 34.1% of single-parent households said they were receiving food stamps, compared to 13.1% of households with children overall, the study https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2020/08/the-disproportionate-effects-of-covid-19-on-households-with-children.html found. 
(GRAPHIC: Households with children face more hardship Households with children face more hardship - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/PARENTS/qzjvqwbblvx/chart.png)
Many single parents said they were falling short, even with the assistance. Some 11.5% said they struggled to find enough food to eat or that their kids sometimes had to miss meals.
The New York Fed analyzed data from the Survey of Consumer Expectations, a monthly poll of a rotating panel of roughly 1,300 nationally representative U.S. households. The broader survey released earlier this week showed that U.S. consumers became more concerned about losing their jobs in July, after two months of feeling slightly more optimistic.
The research did not factor in the challenges faced by families who are taking care of children at home because child care centers and schools are closed. 

Analysts said the child care shortage was forcing parents to make difficult choices and risked reversing some of the economic gains made by working women, who studies show were more likely to take a career hit than men in the absence of child care.

(Reuters) - The U.S. push to fire up its economy in the middle of a pandemic remained stalled last week with signs the lapse of emergency unemployment benefits and business grants may have begun taking a toll.
Hiring at small businesses, shifts worked across a range of industries, credit card spending and even gasoline demand that typically grows through the summer remained flat and mired far below the levels a year ago. 
Initial filings for unemployment insurance did fall below 1 million for the first time since the March onset of the coronavirus-driven economic downturn, and the number of people continuing to collect benefits fell 604,000 to 15.486 million in the week ending August 1. 
The outcome led a New York Federal Reserve weekly index of projected growth in gross domestic product to improve slightly.
Graphic: Oxford Economics Recovery Index https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/OXFORDINDEX/rlgpdlnyepo/chart.png
But while the claims statistics indicate some rehiring continues, the numbers remain massive by historical standards. Concerns are growing that the continued spread of the virus and the inability of the White House and U.S. Congress to agree on new government support for ailing businesses and the unemployed may stifle the recovery altogether.
""The recovery seems to be losing steam,"" said AnnElizabeth Konkel, an economist with job site Indeed Hiring Lab where postings rose for the 14th straight week but at the smallest pace since early May. ""It’s promising that initial unemployment claims have fallen, but there’s still a long road ahead."" 
The risks may be mounting. Much of the U.S. economy depends on consumer spending and a key support lapsed in July when Congress failed to extend a $600 weekly supplement to unemployment insurance. The pandemic payments had been authorized by lawmakers in March along with forgivable loans extended to hundreds of thousands of small businesses.
The combination of that support led personal income to grow despite widespread layoffs, supported jumps in retail spending in May and June, and allowed many Americans to bolster savings and pay down debt - unusual in a recession. 
The high savings rate may pad family spending for a while. An initial hint on whether households are continuing to spend or getting nervous about the lengthening downturn will come on Friday with the release of July retail sales data. Retail sales are expected to have risen 1.9% last month, according to the consensus estimate of analysts polled by Reuters.
Broader measures tracking the overall recovery have shown little improvement. An Oxford Economics index combining health, economic and social data fell last week, and has shown little change since mid-June.

JP Morgan data on credit card spending was unchanged through the first week of August and also has been stuck since mid-June at around 10% below the year ago level.
At this point there seems little extra relief in sight. Democrats and Republicans in Congress remain deadlocked over further emergency aid even with the U.S. economy roughly 13 million jobs short of where it was in February. President Donald Trump has ordered more benefits be paid, but it is unclear if his order has legal authority.
There are some signs of resilience. Overall bankruptcies through July were 25% below the 2019 level, according to data from Epiq AACER, though Chapter 11 corporate bankruptcies have jumped as household names like J.C. Penney and Neiman Marcus succumbed to the steep drop in retail traffic. 
But the early hope for a quick rebound has now faded as the move to restore normal commerce clashed with a rebound in coronavirus cases. Florida recorded a record coronavirus death toll this week, and daily U.S. case growth is more than double what it was at the beginning of June.
Estimates of retail foot traffic using cell phone locations have shown little change, according to data collected by Safegraph and Unacast, and for both companies remain below recent highs in mid-June. 
Graphic: A social slowdown? https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/REOPEN/dgkpldokmpb/chart.png
The number of employees on the job at small businesses whose time records are kept by Homebase fell slightly, and growth in factory work shifts showed little change among companies whose time records are maintained by data firm Kronos.
The 0.5% increase in time clock ""punches"" for the week ended Aug. 9 contrasts with average weekly growth of 2.7% in May and 1.9% in June, ""reinforcing the much slower labor recovery phase"" that seemed to take root after the July 4 holiday, said Dave Gilbertson, vice president of strategy and operations at Kronos.
The weight of that may already be falling on ""high-touch"" service businesses, many of them small firms like restaurants, bars, gyms and beauty parlors, whose fortunes were a motivation for both the U.S. government's Paycheck Protection Program of loans to small businesses and for the push to lift pandemic restrictions sooner rather than later.
Data from Unacast showed a surge of foot traffic to those industries spread across many states in June, stalled in July, and fell through the first week of August.

But Johnson later reiterated that Britain would not drop its rejection of level-playing-field commitments beyond those normally found in a free-trade agreement, a key sticking point. 
Britain, which formally left the EU at the end of January, is seeking to negotiate a new free trade accord by the end of 2020, when a transition period expires.
Martin, who took over as Irish prime minister in June, said he believed agreement on a deal that was tariff and quota free was within grasp.
""There is a landing zone if that will is there on both sides, and I think it is,"" he said.
Johnson later said there was a ""very, very good case for all our friends and partners around the EU to do what I think we all want to do, which is a zero tariffs, zero quota deal. It's there to be done. Let's just get on and do it"".
'MOST SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIP'
On his first visit to Northern Ireland since the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson sought to talk up the strength of the United Kingdom, which he described as ""the most successful political partnership anywhere in the world.""
His message echoed that made on a similar trip to Scotland, where polls show support for independence now outstrips that for remaining part of the United Kingdom.
Northern Ireland remains split on sectarian lines, with many Catholics favouring the creation of a united Ireland while pro-British Protestants favour the status quo. Three decades of bloodshed over the dispute largely ended with a 1998 peace deal.
Johnson also announced the establishment of two new bodies to work on marking the 2021 centenary of Northern Ireland's creation after the rest of the island split from Britain.
The region's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn Fein, which seeks a united Ireland, said she would resist any ""one-sided biased approach from the British government"".

(Reuters) - White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Thursday said he expects the U.S. unemployment rate to return to single-digit levels as early as this month and growth in the third quarter should be 20% or more as the economy recovers from the recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.
""The key point that I would make is the economy is rebounding, it looks like a V-shaped recovery and the recent news now is even better than it was a month ago,"" Kudlow said in a virtual appearance at a conference hosted by the Council of the Americas.
His optimistic outlook contrasts with remarks from several Federal Reserve officials who said this week that the rebound is slowing after a resurgence in coronavirus infections and that the U.S. economy cannot fully recover until the virus is under control. 
The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits dropped below one million last week for the first time since mid-March, but economists said that was likely caused by the expiration of a $600 weekly supplement, which discouraged some people from filing claims.
Kudlow cited the drop in claims as a sign that the labor market is recovering. Asked if the economy needs another round of stimulus, Kudlow said recent executive actions taken by President Donald Trump should provide some relief. These extend enhanced unemployment benefits at a reduced level of up to $400 a week and continue a freeze on student loan interest and payments. But several economists said this week that Trump's actions, which are likely to face legal challenges, would have a minimal impact on the economy.

Kudlow said bipartisan efforts to provide help for small businesses and more direct payments to households could also help, but noted that negotiations with Democrats were at a ""standstill.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The U.S. government is threatening to delist Chinese companies that do not meet U.S. accounting standards, but mainland firms are rushing to offer their shares on New York exchanges, sometimes in blockbuster deals.
Despite the threat and rising U.S.-China tensions, the allure of a valuation on the world's deepest stock market makes the risk of eventual delisting manageable, while financial-technology companies find the regulatory burden of a U.S. listing lighter than that in mainland China or Hong Kong, companies, advisers and investors say. 
""In the immediate term, I don’t see this impacting views of the U.S. markets as a strong choice of listing venue,” said Jason Brown, a Hong Kong partner at law firm Mayer Brown.
So far this year, Chinese companies have raised $5.23 billion in U.S. initial public offerings, more than double the $2.46 billion for the same period last year, Refinitiv data show.
Property management company KE Holdings (N:BEKE), backed by Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), raised $2.12 billion in its U.S. listing on Thursday, the 18th Chinese firm to list there this year.
The pricing for KE, widely known as Beike, came just three days after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Chinese companies that do not comply with U.S. accounting standards would be delisted at the end of 2021.
CEO Stanley Peng told Reuters on Thursday Beike had planned to list for two years and saw the delisting threat as minimal. 
Beike will be followed by Xpeng, an electronic-vehicle maker, which has filed for an IPO. Lufax, an online wealth-management firm, has lodged a confidential application for a U.S. listing, a person with direct knowledge of the deal told Reuters. The company did not respond to a request for comment.
A Hong Kong asset manager who bought into Beike and  Li Auto Inc 's (O:LI) $1.1 billion IPO two weeks ago said U.S.-China tensions have not whetted his appetite.
""The only things that are going to make me worried are when U.S. pension funds are prohibited from investing in Chinese IPOs or when China and the U.S. engage in conflict,"" said the fund manager, who asked not to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media.
Financial advisers to listing candidates said some companies were not being deterred from U.S. listings because the rules have yet to be implemented and there is the potential for ""co-auditing"" in the United States.
In a potential concession, the auditing can be performed by a U.S. parent company of the China-based affiliate tasked with auditing the Chinese firm. Still, new companies would have to comply immediately, officials said over the weekend.

(This story corrects 8th paragraph to say Xpeng IPO will follow Beike's IPO.)

BELGRADE (Reuters) - As U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rallied Central European nations this week to stem Chinese influence by snubbing its advanced digital technology, Chinese surveillance cameras were recording faces and cars in the Serbian capital Belgrade. 
While Serbia aspires to join the European Union, it has made a big swing towards China, the top economic and geo-political competitor of the EU and United States, to help develop its infrastructure, energy and tech sectors and to buy weaponry.
China has provided billions of euros in soft loans for infrastructure and energy development in Serbia. It is also pursuing its plan for a ""digital silk road"" - telecommunications connectivity - in which Serbia would be a key cog in Europe.
On a visit to Slovenia on Thursday, Pompeo said that by rolling out its own 5G network, the ex-Yugoslav republic and EU and NATO member state had secured protection against China's drive ""to control people and information"". 
U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has sought to convince U.S. allies in Europe and Asia to beware of Chinese industrial and intellectual property espionage and to bar Chinese-made equipment from their tech networks or access to sensitive information on individual citizens and businesses.
Huawei , China's giant telecoms equipment maker, denies it spies for Chinese authorities and says the United States wants to frustrate its growth because no U.S. company offers the same technology at a competitive price.
Serbia has signed two non-binding agreements with Huawei since 2017 - one on strategic partnership in the development of broadband internet, the other on a ""smart cities"" project that includes data gathering, storing and management. 
HUAWEI ARRIVES IN SERBIA TO STAY
Trade Minister Rasim Ljajic said last year that state-owned Telekom Srbija was working with Huawei on a 150-million-euro ($177.48 million) project to establish high-speed broadband internet in the Balkan country of seven million people.
As for a state-of-the-art 5G network, a sector where Huawei has a dominant market position, Irini Reljin, Serbia's assistant minister for trade and telecommunications, said Belgrade planned to issue tenders for frequencies by early 2021. 
""We...adhere to procedures of public procurements and EU regulations which stipulate we must have technological neutrality that will guarantee all operators the right to purchase equipment of any manufacturer,"" Reljin told Reuters. 
Huawei, however, is also involved in a project with Serbia's Interior Ministry entailing the installation of over 1,100 surveillance cameras at an undisclosed cost for Belgrade's Safe City surveillance system of traffic and crime control. 
Reljin said Serbian databases were safe from outside interference. ""For us the data safety is the same, regardless of technology and its generation, so for now we are in full compliance with EU regulations.""
Serbian tech experts have also been working with Huawei on the improvement of face-recognition software. 
""Huawei has arrived in Serbia to stay for a long time,"" Nenad Popovic, Serbia's minister for technological development, told reporters in May.
In March, Serbian officials, the Chinese ambassador to Belgrade and Huawei representatives opened a data storage centre in the central city of Kragujevac, the fourth largest in Serbia. 
Top Chinese officials including President Xi Jinping have visited Serbia while Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic - who critics accuse of seeking to stifle dissent - has described ties with Beijing as ""iron"" and Xi as his ""brother"". 
Bosko Jaksic, a columnist with Belgrade's Politika daily, criticised Huawei's presence, calling it ""just a paradigm ...of the aggressive expansion of China...
""The long-term consequences of what this Chinese 'investment occupation force' may bring remain to be seen,"" he said.

1185,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 10:55AM ET</span>",Column: Trump tax deferral poses a bigger threat to Social Security than you might think,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - What happens to Social Security if we eliminate its funding? 
That is the question to ask after Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-congress/trump-vows-to-suspend-us-payroll-tax-after-coronavirus-aid-talks-with-congress-break-down-idUSKCN2532DZ last weekend ordering the deferral through year-end of revenue collected under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act - better known as the payroll tax - that funds Social Security.
FICA is the more appropriate name, because it more accurately describes the purpose of these payroll deductions. ""I think of it as an insurance premium that we pay for Social Security,"" said Bill Arnone, chief executive officer of the National Academy of Social Insurance, a network of research and policy experts on the nation’s social insurance programs. 
Arnone worries about the short-term impact of a payroll tax deferral on the finances of Social Security - and even more about the long-term danger if Trump gets a chance to follow through on a threat he made last weekend - echoed by a top campaign lieutenant - to push for termination altogether of the Social Security tax if he wins a second term.
""The idea that we would not fund Social Security this way in the future opens the door to a fundamentally different approach that changes the program from social insurance to something else,"" Arnone said. ""It would become more like a safety net, and not social insurance.""
Trump stated in the memo that deferring worker FICA obligations is a ""modest, targeted action [that] will put money directly in the pockets of American workers and generate additional incentives for work and employment, right when the money is needed most.""
Social Security and Medicare provide benefits we all earn through a lifetime of contributions - or premiums - that we pay via the FICA. Earned benefit is a core concept of social insurance, alongside the idea that these programs efficiently protect us all against risks - the loss of income in old age in the case of Social Security, or healthcare costs in the case of Medicare.
Social Security is funded primarily by a 12.4% FICA tax split evenly by workers and employers - the program also earns some revenue from interest on trust fund bonds and taxation of benefits. The employer share of the tax was deferred until year end under CARES Act relief legislation signed into law in March. The new presidential memorandum https:// would suspend the employee share from September through December for workers earning less than $4,000 biweekly, pretax.
A FICA deferral will be ineffective as economic policy - it provides tax relief to employed people, not those who have lost jobs and need disaster relief - assistance keeping a roof overhead and food on the table. It is also unclear that employers will want to execute this short-term deferral of tax payments that will be due in 2021 anyway.
A re-elected Trump might have trouble getting a termination of FICA through Congress, and administration officials making the rounds of Sunday morning news shows last weekend tried to walk back that pledge. But here is the scenario that frightens progressive Social Security advocates: if re-elected, Trump could continue to defer contributions under the emergency powers he is leveraging now as the pandemic crisis rolls on.
LEVERAGE FOR REFORM
That could fundamentally alter the balance of power on reform of Social Security in favor of proposals long favored by Republicans, argues Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, a leading progressive advocacy group.
""What Trump has shown is that he believes he has the authority and to decide when FICA contributions are due,"" she said. ""One option for him, if he is re-elected, is to say that the pandemic has us in such bad economic straits that he will defer FICA collections until 2024. That would drain the Social Security trust fund to zero in about two years - at which point he has all the leverage.""
Leverage for what? The Republican Social Security agenda has been spelled out in legislative proposals and bipartisan reform commissions convened over the years. 
The combined Social Security retirement and disability trust funds face a long-term financial shortfall, with program trustees projecting ""exhaustion"" of the funds in 2035. That would leave sufficient FICA revenue to pay roughly 80% of promised benefits. (https://reut.rs/3fRNgXg)
Democrats advocate closing the gap by raising the cap on wages subject to FICA taxes ($137,700 this year) and gradually raising tax rates for employers and workers.
On the Republican side, the big idea is raising the full retirement age (FRA), when you can claim 100% of your earned benefit. The FRA already is rising gradually to 67 under reforms enacted in 1983; Republicans have proposed raising it further to 69 or 70. They also favor means-testing benefits, which would shade the program toward a welfare structure - a benefit you need, rather than one you earn. Under President George W. Bush, they proposed changing Social Security into a system of voluntary personal investment accounts. 
Do Altman’s fears sound far-fetched? Well, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican chair of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, said this week https:// he would support permanent elimination of the FICA tax if it were tied to broader reforms of the program.
Even if that does not come to pass, interrupting the flow of FICA revenue will increase public worry, already sky-high, about the future of Social Security. Most polls show people worry a great deal about whether their benefits will be there in the future. For example, the Pew Research Center has found https://pewrsr.ch/2XQBCpk that 42% of non-retirees doubt they will receive any Social Security benefits when they leave the workforce, and another 42% think benefits will be provided, but at a reduced level.
Defunding Social Security is a surprising proposal to hear in an election year - but that does not mean we should not pay attention.

1187,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 09:30AM ET</span>",Explainer: Why Brazil is on course to shatter its fiscal 'ceiling',"By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's constitutional spending cap, a cornerstone of fiscal policy in recent years, is on course to being broken in 2021.
Government officials insist it will not be altered, warning that to do so would dent the government's credibility and rattle investor confidence in Brazil, pushing up interest rates and hurting growth.
But with Brazil's economy on track for its biggest annual crash ever due to the coronavirus pandemic, the need for fiscal support has never been greater. A growing number of economists argue the spending cap must be raised, tweaked or abolished.
WHAT IS THE FISCAL 'CEILING'?
In December 2016, Congress passed a 20-year 'ceiling' to slow public spending growth, control a ballooning budget deficit and bring public finances back to long-term health.
The constitutional amendment limits the growth in federal government expenditure to the previous year's rate of inflation.
WHY SO LITTLE ROOM TO MANEUVER?
Obligatory spending, such as public-sector pensions, salaries, social security and education, account for more than 90% of all outlays, leaving little room for discretionary expenditure, such as infrastructure and other public investment.
Pensions alone make up half the pie. An aging population and ample coverage for public pensions are expanding that bill faster than inflation, forcing the other half of the pie to shrink in nominal terms, never mind real terms.
However, that second half includes health and education expenditure, which have their own spending 'floors' guaranteeing minimum outlays. It also includes public-sector salaries, which are constitutionally prevented from falling.
WHERE ARE CRACKS APPEARING?
The orthodox view shared by the Economy Ministry, central bank, many lawmakers, most investors and mainstream economists is that the cap is virtually sacrosanct.
However, the COVID-19 crisis has brought the fragility of the budget rule into sharp focus. A growing number of economists say it must be changed to prevent a disastrous collapse in public investment.
Next year's budget is capped at 1.485 trillion reais ($275 billion), only 31 billion reais more than this year. That would give very little room to maneuver in normal times, let alone during a pandemic that has tanked the economy.
Congress passed a parallel 'war budget' of about 600 billion reais this year as part of a nationwide ""state of public calamity"" - emergency spending not subject to the spending cap.

With some lawmakers now pushing to extend that pandemic stimulus into next year, Brazil's budget is on a collision course with the constitutional 'ceiling.'

1188,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",A $2 Trillion Credit Boom Leaves America’s Smaller Firms Behind,"(Bloomberg) -- Unprecedented government stimulus has allowed more companies to borrow at lower rates than ever before. Yet amid the credit boom, smaller firms that power America’s economic engine are often being shut out, hamstringing the recovery just as it begins.
The Federal Reserve’s pledge to use its near limitless balance sheet to buy corporate bonds has aided stricken airlines, oil drillers and hotels. It’s also helped companies from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). to  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V). and  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) access some of the cheapest financing ever seen. All told, firms have sold about $1.9 trillion of investment-grade debt, junk bonds and leveraged loans this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
But for companies not large enough to tap fixed-income markets, the outlook is much more dire. Banks are tightening conditions on loans to smaller firms at a pace not seen since the financial crisis, while many direct lenders that have traditionally focused on the middle market are pulling back or turning to bigger deals instead. What’s more, the Fed’s emergency lending programs for mid-sized businesses and municipalities have been criticized as slow, complex, and largely inaccessible.
A lack of credit for small and medium-sized firms could tip many into bankruptcy, adding to the thousands of local businesses that have already quietly disappeared amid the pandemic’s mounting devastation. Given the sector employs roughly 68 million Americans -- Fed Chairman Jerome Powell calls it America’s “jobs machine” -- and is critical to regional economies across the U.S., a prolonged inability to access financing runs the risk of stalling the nascent rebound.
“The Fed actions have moved issuers that are big enough in front of the velvet rope, and those that aren’t stay outside,” said Peter Atwater, founder of research firm Financial Insyghts and an adjunct lecturer of economics at university William & Mary. “Capital markets access has become a determiner of life or death for business.”
That’s not to say the Fed’s current policy approach is necessarily misguided. In fact, many economists commend its quick and decisive actions when the pandemic hit and say those bold steps were key in staving off another financial crisis and possibly even a depression. But amid such large-scale intervention, certain parts of the economy are clearly benefiting more than others -- the big and powerful over the small and financially vulnerable, a disparity that to some degree mirrors the broader inequality problems that have been exposed by the pandemic.
The Fed announced its corporate bond-buying plan in March, opening the issuance floodgates after the coronavirus outbreak brought the market to a virtual standstill. Investment-grade firms have borrowed more than $1.3 trillion in 2020, a record pace, while junk-rated companies have sold $274 billion of bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In addition, they’ve priced over $270 billion of leveraged loans.
Alphabet’s $10 billion bond sale earlier this month saw record-low yields on the seven-year portion, besting levels set by Amazon in June. Chevron priced a two-year bond with an unprecedented 0.333% coupon earlier this week, while Visa issued seven, 10- and 30-year notes that all beat or matched previous records.
On the high-yield side, aluminum-packaging company  Ball Corp  (NYSE:BLL). sold $1.3 billion of 10-year notes at 2.875% on Monday, the lowest ever for a U.S. speculative-grade offering with a maturity of five year or longer.
“It’s a battle between the Fed’s $750 billion special purpose vehicle to buy corporate investment-grade and high-yield bonds and those who don’t have access to this free money,” said Stephen Blumenthal, chief executive officer at money manager CMG Capital Management Group Inc.
Survival Uncertain
It’s a battle that smaller companies are decidedly losing.
Some 70% of bank senior loan officers surveyed by the Fed said they have tightened lending standards on loans for small commercial and industrial firms in the third quarter. That’s the highest proportion since late 2008. The trend also extends to mid-size and larger firms as well, though the latter enjoy unprecedented access to capital markets. About 54% said they increased premiums for small borrowers, the most in over a decade.
“Everyone is willing to lend to the biggest firms,” said Olivier Darmouni, a professor of finance at Columbia Business School. “But since the pandemic has not been tamed, creditors are now asking if the businesses will actually survive and they’ll get their money back. For smaller firms, there’s a lot more uncertainty of that.”
In a bid to encourage banks to extend credit to mid-size firms, the Fed introduced its $600 billion Main Street Lending Program in April, wherein those making eligible loans can sell 95% of them to the central bank. Despite efforts to broaden the program, it’s issued just $253 million in loans as of Aug. 10. That’s compounded criticism that it only works for a narrow set of companies, is too complex and doesn’t provide enough incentive to risk-averse lenders.
Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said Wednesday that as borrowers and banks become more familiar with the program, it’s seeing a steady increase in participation, adding that it may become even more essential should the coming months bring a resurgence of the virus.
A spokesman for the Fed referred Bloomberg to Rosengren’s remarks when contacted for comment.
Still, the facility stands in contrast to the Paycheck Protection Program, run by the Small Business Administration and the Treasury, which dolled out more than 5.2 million loans totaling $525 billion before closing last week. The PPP facility, for its part, has gotten its own share of criticism, with some saying the smallest companies and those in disadvantaged areas have been shut out, while politically connected businesses and firms that aren’t struggling have gotten funding.
Making matters worse, direct lenders, which often provide financing to small and mid-size firms, have been retrenching for months as they tend to their own portfolios, while those sitting atop the most capital are increasingly targeting bigger deals.
Business development company Ares Capital Corp. said on a second quarter earnings call that the average Ebitda size of companies it finances has doubled versus the same period a year ago, and that it’s also charging more to lend. Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc. set up a new lending business last month focusing on loans of around $1 billion.
“There is little the Fed can do when there are liquidity issues outside the banking system,” Financial Insyghts’s Atwater said. “It has really highlighted the challenge in trying to provide credit to small businesses in a way that is prudent for the lender.”
Cerebro Capital, an online platform that allows middle-market borrowers to source credit facilities, saw a surge in demand for its services amid the tighter lending market, according to Allan Smallwood, senior director of capital markets at the firm. At the end of July, Cerebro helped a fifth generation family-owned commercial printing business close a deal after its existing bank lender exited when it tripped a loan covenant, he said.
Haves, Have Nots
Of course, the tale of diverging ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ is hardly new in credit, manifesting when economic turbulence prompts lenders to retrench and investors to seek the relative safety of stable, blue-chip firms.
But the magnitude of the disparity this time around is more alarming when combined with expectations for record corporate defaults this year and following second quarter data showing the economy suffered its sharpest downturn since at least the 1940s. A growing chorus is also warning on inflation, which can hit smaller firms particularly hard. One of those is Larry McDonald, founder of The Bear Traps Report investment newsletter.
“It’s an inequality explosion in terms of financial sustainability,” said McDonald, who also authored the book ‘A Colossal Failure of Common Sense’ about the demise of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. “You have financial conditions tightening in some spots, and then wide open for the big guys -- it’s crazy.”

1189,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 06:26AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday, August 13th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Thursday means jobless claims day, and economists expect the number of people claiming unemployment benefits for the first time to have fallen by some 64,000 to 1.12 million. President Donald Trump stays his hand regarding new tariffs on European goods. Stocks are set to open marginally lower as the deadlock over the next stimulus package drags on, and oil prices dip from five-month highs after the IEA cuts its global demand forecast. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 13th August.
 1. Jobless claims due as Daly warns some jobs may never come back
Initial jobless claims are expected to have fallen to 1.12 million last week, in what would be the lowest since the pandemic exploded in March. Continuing jobless claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial ones, are likewise expected to have dipped below 16 million for the first time since April.
San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said late Wednesday that she feared many of the jobs lost since March would be lost forever, with the less-educated part of the workforce bearing the brunt.
Elsewhere, France reported a surprise drop in its second-quarter jobless numbers, but only because it only counts those who are actively looking for work, something that was practically impossible during lockdown. The employment rate for young French people fell to 26.6%, in a more accurate reflection of a dire situation.
2. Stimulus deadlock drags on 
There’s still no sign of Congressional Republican and Democrats breaking the deadlock on talks over the next round of economic relief measures.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Wednesday that lower chamber was prepared to meet the Senate and administration halfway, bridging the gap between the administration’s $1 trillion proposal and the House’s $3.5 trillion bill.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described Pelosi’s characterization of talks on Wednesday as misleading, saying that the Democrats’ negotiators hadn’t been prepared to compromise at all.
3. Stocks set to open lower; jobless data eyed
U.S. stock markets are set to open modestly lower ahead of the jobless claims data, which are likely to set the tone for the day.

4. Trump pauses on EU tariffs 
President Donald Trump decided not to raise the overall level of import tariffs on EU goods, in an apparent move to make sure that the squeeze on Americans’ spending power isn’t made any worse by tariffs ahead of the election.
However, the administration did introduce fresh tariffs on selected products, such as French jams and jellies and German knives. The tariffs are part of measures allowed under a WTO ruling that found the EU guilty of illegally subsidizing Airbus.
Airbus (PA:AIR) stock fell 1.6% in Paris.
5. Oil consolidates as IEA trims demand outlook
Crude oil prices softened slightly after the International Energy Agency followed the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in trimming its forecast for average oil demand this year.
U.S. crude futures were down 0.1% at $42.64 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent was down 0.3% at $45.31 a barrel
The IEA cut its estimates for the last two quarters of this year by 500,000 barrels a day, projecting that consumption will average 95.25 million barrels a day in the period.
The reduced forecasts this week have been largely due to slack demand for jet fuel, as air travel has failed to rebound with the same vigor as travel by car and truck.  The extent of that was again shown on Thursday as German-based Tui  (DE:TUIGn), the world’s largest travel group, said its revenue had fallen 98% from year-earlier levels in the three months through June."

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>","In China, fears of financial Iron Curtain as U.S. tensions rise","By Samuel Shen, Winni Zhou and Kevin Yao
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - A sharp escalation in tensions with the United States has stoked fears in China of a deepening financial war that could result in it being shut out of the global dollar system - a devastating prospect once considered far-fetched but now not impossible.
Chinese officials and economists have in recent months been unusually public in discussing worst-case scenarios under which China is blocked from dollar settlements, or Washington freezes or confiscates a portion of China's huge U.S. debt holdings.
Those concerns have galvanised some in Beijing to revive calls to bolster the yuan's global clout as it looks to decrease reliance on the greenback.
Some economists even float the idea of settling exports of China-made COVID-19 vaccines in yuan, and are looking to bypass dollar settlement with a digital version of the currency.
""Yuan internationalisation was a good-to-have. It's now becoming a must-have,"" said Shuang Ding, head of Greater China economic research at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) and a former economist at the People's Bank of China (PBOC).
The threat of Sino-U.S. financial ""decoupling"" is becoming ""clear and present"", Ding said.
Although a complete separation of the world's two largest economies is unlikely, the Trump administration has been pushing for a partial decoupling in key areas related to trade, technology and financial activity.
Washington has unleashed a barrage of actions penalising China, including proposals to bar U.S. listings of Chinese companies that fail to meet U.S. accounting standards and bans on the Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat apps. Further tension is expected in the run-up to U.S. elections on Nov. 3.
""A broad financial war has already started ... the most lethal tactics have yet to be used,"" Yu Yongding, an economist at the state-backed Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) who previously advised the PBOC, told Reuters.
Yu said the ultimate sanction would involve U.S. seizures of China's U.S. assets - Beijing holds over $1 trillion yuan in U.S. government debt - which would be difficult to implement and a self-inflicted wound for Washington.
But calling U.S. leaders ""extremists"", Yu said a decoupling is not impossible, so China should make preparations.
HIGH STAKES
The stakes are high. Any move by Washington to cut China off from the dollar system or retaliation by Beijing to sell a big chunk of U.S. debt could roil financial markets and hurt the global economy, analysts said.
Fang Xinghai, a senior securities regulator, said China is vulnerable to U.S. sanctions and should make ""early"" and ""real"" preparations. ""Such things have already happened to many Russian businesses and financial institutions,"" Fang told a June forum organised by Chinese media outlet Caixin.
Guan Tao, former director of the international payments department of China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange and now chief global economist at BOC International (China), also said Beijing should ready itself for decoupling.
""We have to mentally prepare that the United States could expel China from the dollar settlement system,"" he told Reuters. 
In a report he co-authored last month, Guan called for increased use of China's yuan settlement system, Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, in global trade. Most of China's cross-border transactions are settled in dollars via the SWIFT system, which some say leaves it vulnerable.
RENEWED PUSH
After a five-year lull, Beijing is reviving its push to globalise the yuan.
The PBOC's Shanghai head office last month urged financial institutions to expand yuan trade and prioritise local currency use in direct investment.
Central bank chief Yi Gang said in remarks published on Sunday that yuan internationalisation is proceeding well, with cross-border settlements growing 36.7% in the first half of 2020 from a year earlier.
Still, internationalisation is hampered by China's own stringent capital controls. It could also face resistance from countries that have criticised China on matters ranging from the coronavirus to its clampdown on Hong Kong.
The yuan's share of global foreign exchange reserves surpassed 2% in the first quarter, Yi said. It also beat the Swiss franc in June to be the fifth most-used currency for international payments, with a share of 1.76%, according to SWIFT.
One way to accelerate cross-border settlement would be to price some exports in renminbi, such as a possible coronavirus vaccine, suggested Tommy Xie, head of Greater China research at OCBC Bank in Singapore.
Another is to use a proposed digital yuan in cross-border transactions on the back of currency swaps between central banks, bypassing systems such as SWIFT, said Ding Jianping, finance professor at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics.
China has fast-tracked plans to develop a sovereign digital currency, while the PBOC has been busy signing currency swap deals with foreign counterparts.
Shuang Ding of Standard Chartered said Beijing has no choice but to prepare for Washington's ""nuclear option"" of kicking China out of the dollar system.

""Beijing cannot afford to be thrown into disarray when sanctions indeed befall China,"" he said.

1192,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>",Britain to step up challenge over U.S. whisky tariff,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said it would step up demands for the United States to drop tariffs on goods such as single malt Scotch whisky after the industry warned a decision by Washington to retain the levy was putting its future at risk.
The U.S. government on Wednesday said it would maintain 15% tariffs on Airbus (PA:AIR) aircraft and 25% tariffs on other European goods as part of a long-running trade dispute, although it held off adding some extra tariffs as it had threatened.
British Trade Secretary Liz Truss welcomed the absence of new tariffs, but said she had raised the whisky issue with her U.S. counterpart Robert Lighthizer during talks last week and she would now go further.
""These tariffs damage industry and livelihoods on both sides of the Atlantic and are in nobody's interests,"" she said in a statement on Thursday. ""I am therefore stepping up talks with the U.S. to remove them as soon as possible.""
After leaving the European Union earlier this year Britain is trying to tie up swift trade deals with major partners like the United States to capitalise on its new freedom to strike bilateral deals rather than EU-wide ones.
But Britain has still been affected by a decision from Washington to impose tariffs on an array of EU food, wine and spirits in retaliation for EU subsidies on large aircraft. 
The Scotch Whisky Association said exports to the U.S. had fallen 30% since the tariff came into force and jobs and the supply chain were at risk. 
""It has taken the UK government a full six months after the UK left the EU to start to tackle tariffs directly with the U.S. government, which seems to us inexplicably slow,"" Chief Executive Karen Betts said. 
She urged London to do more to support the industry. 

""Scotch Whisky is a crucial part of Scotland's economy, employing over 11,000 people and many more than that through our supply chain, in some of the UK's most productive jobs,"" she said.

1193,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 03:25AM ET</span>",China data mystery prompts talk of stealth PBOC bond buying,"SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - A mysterious increase in Chinese government bond (CGB) holdings by unknown investors has prompted speculation that China's central bank has bought the debt in recent months to bolster the country's economic recovery.
The value of CGBs held by ""other institutions"", typically little changed from month to month, jumped 196.49 billion yuan to 1.79 trillion yuan ($257.89 billion) in July, according to data from China Central Depository and Clearing Co (CCDC). 
""There exists the possibility of central bank purchases of government bonds,"" said Ming Ming, head of fixed income research at CITIC Securities said of the data in a note.
He cited the bank's second-quarter monetary policy report last week, which called for monetary and fiscal policy to work together and to encourage smooth issuance of government bonds.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) cannot buy government bonds on the primary market, but is permitted to do so on the secondary market.
Chinese economists and policy advisers have been in a heated debate for months over whether the central bank should monetize the country's fiscal deficit by buying government bonds, also known as quantitative easing, to support government efforts to get the economy back on track after the coronavirus crisis.
But other market players were less certain of direct action.
""If the PBOC put treasury bonds on its own balance sheet, it might damage its independence,"" said a fixed income manager at a brokerage in Shanghai. 
""The PBOC has plenty of ways to 'buy' treasury bonds,"" without directly doing so, he added.
Nie Wen, a Shanghai-based economist at Hwabao Trust, said that the PBOC may have moved into the market through other institutions to keep interest rates under control, but that it was also impossible to rule out bond buying by foreign institutions through agents.
Global innvestors have been keen buyers of Chinese debt for months, drawn by plump yields.
""As for the central bank ... consumption remains weak and economic recovery is slow. (It) hopes for normalization but it also hopes to keep policy relatively loose,"" Nie said.
CCDC defines ""other institutions"" as including the PBOC, China's finance ministry and policy banks, but data does not show which specific institution drove the recent rise.

The PBOC did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. It will release new balance sheet data later this month.

1194,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 03:15AM ET</span>","BOJ paying banks to boost pandemic relief, compensates for negative interest rates","By Hideyuki Sano and Mariko Sakaguchi
TOKYO (Reuters) - As the Bank of Japan tries to pump more funds to companies hit by the coronavirus pandemic, it is offering banks hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses, a move analysts say is aimed at easing the side-effects of its negative interest rate policy.
Record bank lending in recent months suggests the BOJ's plan is working -- a rare success of late in its battle to revive the economy -- but it is also a sign that policymakers' focus is now more on supporting banks, rather than keeping rates low.
So far, a wall of money printed by the BOJ in recent years has kept a lid on bankruptcies and job losses as the economy tips into a deep recession. But the prolonged battle with COVID-19 is adding to strains on regional banks.
""This is one of the most effective policy moves the BOJ has made in recent years,"" said Takehiro Noguchi, senior economist at Mizuho Research.
""The BOJ will likely continue to take steps to alleviate the side-effect of its monetary easing... The BOJ thinks negative interest rates is something it should not have done.""
In March, as COVID-19 clobbered the global economy, the BOJ cobbled together special ""coronavirus relief"" operations to help keep cash-strapped companies afloat. Under the scheme, the BOJ lends cash to banks against their lending to the private sector, such as loans and bonds, as collateral.
The operation started off quietly but got a major boost after the BOJ decided in April to add a sweetener by giving banks a bonus of 10 basis points (bps) or 0.1% per year, for using the scheme, a bonanza when 10-year government bonds  yield 0.04%.
Banks rushed to the plan, gobbling up 27 trillion yen ($250 billion) through the channel by July. That is roughly as much as the amount of banks' deposits on which the BOJ imposes negative interest rates.
BACKDOOR COMPENSATION
The BOJ went negative in 2016 in an attempt to weaken the yen and lower corporate borrowing costs. But it has imposed a minus 0.1% rate on only a small portion of banks' deposits, amid concerns the policy could squeeze lenders' margins and possibly reduce the flow of credit to the economy.
The BOJ has paid 0.1% interest to banks on a total of about 208 trillion yen deposits, while the remainder carries zero interest.
For a graphic on BOJ's three-tier interest rates:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbpgbemkvq/20811A.png
The complicated, three-tier interest rate system was intended to keep the benchmark interbank lending rate below zero percent while limiting the negative interest banks have to pay to the BOJ.
But paying additional interest on the new scheme is undermining the case for negative rates even further, analysts said.
""In the grand scheme of things, we could see this as a policy normalisation as well as enhancing support for banks,"" said Katsutoshi Inadome, senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
As a result of the BOJ's move to increase interest payments to banks, the benchmark interbank overnight interest rate has also edged up, staying mostly above minus 0.05%. 
The BOJ declined to comment on the matter. 
For a graphic on Japan interbank interest rate:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmyvmklyavr/20811M.png
The BOJ's plan appears to be working so far. Data this week showed banks' lending rose by a record 6.3% in July from a year earlier to 572.7 trillion yen ($5.36 trillion). That represents an increase of about 26 trillion yen since March, suggesting the BOJ has effectively back-financed nearly all of the bank lending growth since then.

EXTENSION EXPECTED
Although the operation was supposed to be temporary, many market players now expect the BOJ will extend it beyond its scheduled expiry next March.
While backtracking on negative rates could in theory erode the BOJ's credibility, most market players said the latest scheme was typical of the flexible and often innovative policymaking displayed by Governor Haruhiko Kuroda.
""Should the BOJ ever need to cut interest rates further to ease its policy, the central bank will combine it with more bonus schemes like this, to the extent that the net effect becomes unclear,"" said Izuru Kato, chief economist Totan Research.

1195,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 03:05AM ET</span>",Australian insurers ask courts to decide on pandemic payouts,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Insurance Council of Australia began legal action on Thursday to seek formal clarification on whether they need to pay insurance claims to small businesses hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
The ICA, whose members represent about 95% total premium income written by private sector general insurers, submitted pleadings to the New South Wales Supreme Court for a test case.
The industry is turning to the courts following numerous complaints to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) by small businesses whose claims on business interruption policies because of the pandemic have been denied by their insurers.
The ICA said the Australian units of Hollard Insurance Group and HDI Global Specialty had offered two rejected claims from a caravan park and a food distribution business for the test case. The industry has agreed to pay the legal costs of the two businesses.
""We remain of the clear view that business interruption coverages do not cover pandemics,"" Hollard Insurance Company Chief Executive Richard Enthoven said in a statement. ""However, we volunteered to be part of the test case process so that the courtsystemcan clarify for our policyholders, Hollard and the industry how to handle this important issue.""
The ICA said that insurers globally have designed and priced their policies on the basis that pandemics are not insurable due to the magnitude of potential losses, the challenges of modelling the risk and ensuring coverage affordability.
""The industry wishes to have the case heard as quickly as possible, given the challenging times being experienced by the small business sector because of COVID-19, the past season of natural disasters and the recession,"" ICA Chief Executive Rob Whelan said in the statement.
A similar test case is already underway in the United Kingdom, while another is being considered in South Africa.
QBE Insurance Group (AX:QBE) Chief Executive Patrick Regan said on Thursday that Australian insurers had included specific pandemic exclusions in their policies after the SARS pandemic of 2002 and 2003.

China aims to have about 200,000 kilometres (124,274 miles) of railway tracks by the end of 2035, including about 70,000 km of high-speed railway, according to a plan issued by state-owned China State Railway Group.
The targets compare with a total length of 141,400 km of existing rail lines as of end-July, among which 36,000 km are high-speed routes, the most in the world, company data showed.
The goals would mean a 33.3% increase in China's railway network from this year and a 133% expansion in high-speed railway, according to Reuters calculations.
In a 2016-2020 plan issued in 2016, China said it aimed to expand its railway network to 150,000 km by 2020, including 30,000 km of high-speed rail.
All cities with a population of over 200,000 will be covered by the railway network before 2035, and those with a population of more than 500,000 will be connected to high-speed tracks, according to the latest plan.
China will also promote railway construction in places dominated by ethnic minority groups, as well as border areas and underdeveloped regions in central and western China, to help alleviate poverty and revitalise the countryside, the company said.
The world's second-largest economy has vowed to speed up urbanisation and new infrastructure investments to revive an economy battered by the novel coronavirus epidemic.
Fixed-asset investment in railways totalled 325.8 billion yuan ($46.93 billion) in the first half of this year, up 1.2% from a year earlier, the company said last month.

1201,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 10:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trump administration asks court to dismiss Big Tech's challenge to social media executive order,"By Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has filed a motion asking a court to dismiss a lawsuit against the president's executive order targeting social media companies, calling it a ""profound misunderstanding,"" according to a copy of the motion seen by Reuters.
The lawsuit was brought in June by the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a Washington-based tech group funded by  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). It marked the first major legal test of President Donald Trump's directive.
Trump issued an executive order in May against social media companies in an attempt to regulate platforms where he has been criticized, just days after Twitter took the rare step of fact-checking one of his tweets about mail-in voting. Trump threatened to scrap or weaken a law known as Section 230, which protects internet companies from litigation over content posted by users.
The lawsuit by CDT argued Trump's social media executive order violates the First Amendment rights of social media companies, will chill future online speech and reduce the ability of Americans to speak freely online.
The administration argues that the executive order only directs government agencies, and not private companies, to act.
""The EO challenged here imposes no obligations on any private party,"" said the motion filed by the Department of Justice in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which was seen by Reuters.
""It directs executive officials to take steps that could lead various agencies to examine ... allegations that large social media online platforms have displayed political bias in moderating content,"" the motion said.
The lawsuit reflects long-simmering tensions between the Trump administration and social media companies that have become key tools in Trump's political arsenal.
Avery Gardiner, CDT's general counsel, called Trump's executive order ""unconstitutional."" CDT's lawsuit argues that the White House ran afoul of the First Amendment, which prohibits government officials from retaliating against an individual or entity for engaging in protected speech.
""Instead of actually trying to address the merits of the issues, and to engage in litigation that will show the severe constitutional deformities of the executive order, it is resorting to legal maneuvering,"" Gardiner said on Wednesday, referring to the Trump administration's move. 
The CDT has negotiated a briefing schedule with the DOJ. CDT will be filing its response by the end of August and the government is likely to respond by Sept. 21, she said.
White House spokesman Judd Deere (NYSE:DE) said the administration moved to dismiss the case because ""it is not a valid legal argument.""
""The left-wing lobbying organization's brief seems to suggest it doesn't understand how administrative action works or possibly that it doesn't understand the nature of the judicial system,"" he told Reuters on Wednesday.
The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.
Twitter called the executive order a ""reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law."" It declined comment on the CDT lawsuit. Google and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.
Trump's order seeks to channel complaints about political bias to the Federal Trade Commission. At a recent Senate hearing, the agency's chairman, Joseph Simons, said the FTC has not taken any action to enforce the order.

The U.S. Commerce Department has petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) seeking new transparency rules in how social media companies moderate content after Trump's executive order directed the action. Earlier this month FCC Chairman Ajit Pai agreed to open the petition to public comment for 45 days.

Insurers received 7,000 life insurance claims from families of people who died from COVID-19 and 83% have been paid so far, the ABI said in a statement. Every life insurance claim has been accepted, it said.
The average payout is expected to be 63,000 pounds for an individual policy and 137,000 for a group policy.
Life insurers have been hit by the pandemic but their losses are seen as limited.
Although they are paying life insurance claims, worsening life expectancy will mean pensions, often the bulk of their business, are paid for a shorter period, industry sources say.
The ABI has said it expected its members to pay 1.2 billion pounds in pandemic-related claims this year, in sectors such as business interruption and event cancellation.
Industry sources say that figure could reach billions if the Financial Conduct Authority wins a test case against insurers over business interruption policy wordings. A decision is expected in mid-September.

Sovereign bonds held by “other” investors -- a category that includes central banks and clearing houses -- rose by 196.5 billion yuan to 1.78 trillion yuan ($256 billion) last month, according to data released by China Central Depository & Clearing Co. last week.
The increase is the biggest since Bloomberg data started in late 2018, prompting analysts from Citic Securities Co. to  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc and GF Securities Co. to speculate the central bank might have bought some government debt in the month. The PBOC didn’t immediately respond to queries about the data.
Policy makers have frequently said in the past they do not intend to enact the kind of bond-market purchases seen in developed markets and have restricted stimulus measures throughout the coronavirus crisis to moderate trimming of market interest rates and a more generous liquidity policy. But they have flagged a willingness to support the government’s fiscal policy.
Last week, the PBOC said in a policy report it’ll work with the Ministry of Finance to smooth government bond sales, without specifying the measures. Analysts have expected the institution will manage liquidity supply to help local banks absorb a record amount of special bond sales this year.
PBOC Shouldn’t Buy Government Bonds Directly, Adviser Says
“There’s a possibility that the central bank has bought sovereign bonds,” Ming Ming, head of fixed-income research at Citic Securities Co in Beijing, wrote in a note, though he cited the possibility of other factors being behind the rise. The move is more likely to be an effort to “directly finance the real economy” rather than quantitative easing, with the PBOC buying anti-virus bonds that invest in projects with a steady return, he said.
Some economists cautioned against such speculation. While secondary-market purchases are a possibility, more data is needed to verify the idea, especially the central bank’s July balance sheet data, according to Nomura International’s chief China economist Lu Ting. The PBOC is expected to release those figures on Friday, according to a calendar on the bank’s website.
Xing Zhaopeng, an economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd in Shanghai, said he believes the bonds were bought by foreign central banks via their currency swap agreements with the PBOC.
Researchers affiliated with China’s Ministry of Finance had previously suggested the central bank should buy some government debt this year, a step which could help reduce the impact on markets as the government plans a record amount of sales to mitigate growth risks. The PBOC is forbidden by the nation’s central bank law from purchasing government debt in the primary market.

""It creates the potential for a hole, a little bit of a hole in consumer demand and consumer spending,"" Daly told reporters Wednesday. ""We have evidence that suggests they were spending those resources to pay rent or to buy food or to buy other consumer goods.""
Daly said recent economic data suggests consumers are already starting to pull back on activities as their benefits shrinks and coronavirus infections rise, leading to new restrictions. ""I also hear from my contacts that they're seeing foot traffic and other things just slow as people become aware that the virus isn't behind us,"" she said. 

The economic crisis caused by the virus is turning out to be more prolonged than initially expected, increasing the need for Congress to provide a ""bridge"" that gets consumers and businesses through the downturn, Daly said. Bankruptcies and insolvencies could rise in the fall as some businesses close permanently and others struggle to catch up on rent and other debts, she said.

1206,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 05:09PM ET</span>",China Investors Pick Winners From Xi’s Big New Economic Mantra,"(Bloomberg) --
“Dual circulation” might not sound like the niftiest moniker for an equity strategy, but it’s a phrase that’s captured the attention of investors in China’s $9.5 trillion stock market.
After first raising eyebrows in a May document, the Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo last month emphasized that a “dual circulation” strategy will be critical to China’s long-term development. The idea is to twin a build-up in domestic economic strength in face of intensifying external risks -- while maintaining China’s deep engagement with the global supply chain.
“Policy makers likely envisage China’s growth model in the future will be much less like Japan and Korea, but more like the U.S.,” said Yi Xiong, chief China economist at Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) in Hong Kong. “Preferences of domestic consumers will become more important than international ones in shaping companies’ decisions.”
Some of the investor reactions to directives from Beijing have sparked crazes as China’s millions of retail traders, who dominate day-to-day transactions in the onshore market, rushed toward the new theme.
In particular defense, consumer and satellite stocks have outperformed lately, including:
There are few details on the new approach. President Xi Jinping oversaw the July 30 Politburo meeting where the “dual circulation” strategy was emphasized. That was days after Xi said at a gathering with business leaders that “we must give full play to the advantages of the domestic super-large market” amid rising protectionism and the global economic downturn. The strategy is to effectively reduce reliance on the West -- just as other nations seek to become less dependent on China for economic growth amid rising U.S.-China tensions.
Think tanks are already kicking into gear. A 21st Century Economic Research Institute study on Aug. 11 said that Chinese cities relying on overseas trade ought to reorient toward the domestic economy.
“A concerted shift by Chinese cities away from exporting over the next five years would reshape global trade patterns and supply chains,” analysts at Trivium China, a Beijing-based consulting group co-founded by economist Andrew Polk, wrote in a note.

The Communist Party’s Central Committee will meet in October to outline China’s next five-year plan, which could build out specific policies to buttress domestic demand.
Among the policy steps that  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analysts are watching for: income-tax cuts and social security contributions to boost household incomes, improved medical coverage to reduce precautionary savings and experiments with land reform to “unlock” rural wealth.
Private consumption amounted to 39% of China’s gross domestic product in 2019, “low” by both emerging market and Group of 20 nation standards, Citigroup economists including Xiangrong Yu wrote in an Aug. 9 report. The ratio in the U.S. is more than two-thirds.
“Top-down policies are not to be taken lightly -- they mean business,” said Wu Xianfeng, a fund manager at Shenzhen Longteng Assets Management Co. “It’s rewarding to follow the party’s lead when investing in China.”
But “dual circulation” may be a preoccupation for investors for some time to come, given that the context of the leadership’s discussions have been the country’s long-term development.
Wu said he’s already shifting some of Shenzhen Longteng’s positioning.
“We have been cutting on firms that have higher overseas exposure, such as consumer electronics, and going heavy on those that mostly rely on state investment,” such as satellite stocks, Wu said.
That tactic draws on a key component of China’s likely plan, which is enhancing its already high-priority moves to build up domestic high-technology industries, along with defense.
Another favored approach is looking at the companies likely to supply Chinese buyers who previously flocked overseas to snap up luxury items. New duty-free policies in May from the regional government of Hainan, a tropical island off China’s southern coast helped strengthen that narrative.

Department-store operator Wangfujing Group Co. has been one of the big winners on that score, surging 311% over the past three months. China Tourism Group Duty Free Corp. has climbed 128% in that time.
One school of thought says the new development focus will prove negative for property developers. The argument goes that funding will need to come from somewhere for the new initiatives, and that may starve the real estate sector. Others counter that rising incomes will boost demand for upgrading housing.
“The proposal has sparked heated discussion,” Peng Wensheng, chief economist at China International Capital Corp., wrote in an Aug. 10 note on the dual-circulation proposal.
Peng’s CICC colleagues including analyst Hanfeng Wang wrote earlier in the month that import substitution may become a key trend, with policy makers paying greater attention to security, resilience and effective control of its supply chains.
Given the importance of capital markets to financing industrial innovation along with expanding household wealth, it’s also worth watching leading securities firms, exchanges and investment management companies, according to CICC.
But for now, it may pay to watch for further details from policy makers.
“Investors in China have become accustomed to following the party’s lead, as it often proves to be quite lucrative in the end,” said Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bocom International. “After all, if you’re gambling in a casino, don’t you have to play by what the gaming hall operators say?”

1208,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>","New Jersey governor can borrow $9.9 billion to plug shortfalls, top state court rules","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - New Jersey's highest court on Wednesday rejected an effort by state Republicans to block Democratic Governor Phil Murphy from borrowing as much as $9.9 billion to help offset plunging tax revenue resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.
The New Jersey Supreme Court said the state's COVID-19 Emergency Bond Act was constitutional, but officials will need to certify that projected revenue and fiscal shortfalls were ""as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic"" before they can borrow.
State legislators had passed the law on July 16, prompting a lawsuit by the New Jersey Republican State Committee, which said it violated the appropriations and debt limitation clauses of New Jersey's constitution.
Lawyers for the committee did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Murphy is expected to publicly discuss the decision later on Wednesday.
The $9.9 billion cap represented New Jersey's estimate of how much less tax revenue it might collect through June 30, 2021, compared with its projection before the pandemic struck.
In Wednesday's 7-0 decision, Chief Justice Stuart Rabner said COVID-19 qualified as a ""disaster"" permitting the state to resort on emergency financing to plug anticipated shortfalls.
He said the plaintiffs had not met the ""heavy burden"" of showing that the law's alleged unconstitutionality was ""clear beyond reasonable doubt.""
States nationwide have struggled with lower tax revenues because of decreased economic activity and higher unemployment resulting from the pandemic.
New Jersey, whose population is about 8.88 million, was one of the earliest U.S. hotspots for the coronavirus, and has had more than 185,000 cases and 14,000 deaths.
Its per capita infection rate is now lower than in many other states as the pandemic took hold elsewhere in the country.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Ontario, Canada's most populous province and economic engine, projected on Wednesday its budget deficit would widen to a record C$38.5 billion ($29.09 billion) in 2020-2021 as it raised support for the economy ravaged by the coronavirus crisis.
The province boosted projected COVID-19 support measures to C$30 billion from C$17 billion in March, when its estimate for the deficit was C$20.5 billion.
It includes C$4 billion in partnership with the federal government to help municipalities and transit agencies, as well as a one-time top up of C$4.3 billion for a health contingency fund and C$3 billion in direct support for people and jobs.
""The size of the deficit was not unexpected given all of the events of the past few months as well as the additional measures that will be implemented through the remainder of the year,"" said Brian Calder, a portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Canada.
The yield on its 10-year bond was up about 2 basis points to 1.32%, in line with the move in Government of Canada bonds.
Program expenses are projected to be C$174.2 billion in 2020-2021, which is C$13.1 billion higher than estimated in March, while revenues are seen C$5.7 billion lower at C$150.6 billion as the economy contracts.
Ontario projects GDP will shrink by 6.7% in 2020 before rebounding by 5.5% in 2021. Much of its economy has reopened in recent months as the number of coronavirus cases declined.
Net debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise to 47.1% in 2020-2021 from 41.7% seen in March.
The province, one of the world's biggest sub-sovereign borrowers, has completed C$23.6 billion of an estimated C$52.1 billion in long-term borrowing for the current fiscal year.
""Ontario will have a lot of wood to chop once they become active again (in issuance) as we approach the fall months,"" Calder said.

The province is maintaining a higher than normal reserve of C$2.5 billion to give it greater fiscal flexibility.

1210,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 01:05PM ET</span>",Fed policymakers say economic growth will be muted until virus contained,"By Jonnelle Marte and Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - The U.S. economic slowdown is likely to continue as more restrictions are put in place to control the coronavirus epidemic, and Americans will have to learn to ""live with"" the virus for the rest of the year, two Federal Reserve policymakers said on Wednesday.
Consumer spending will probably remain weak relative to the past as people avoid activities that require high levels of social interaction for health reasons, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said during an online event organized by the South Shore Chamber of Commerce in Massachusetts.
""The forecast for the U.S. economy this fall is quite uncertain, but my view is that the recent slowdown in economic activity that we have seen in high-frequency data is likely to continue,"" Rosengren said. 
With a vaccine unlikely to be ready in the immediate future, consumers and businesses need a plan to manage the risks of the virus throughout the fall and winter, Rosengren said.
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan voiced similar concerns, saying in a webcast event with the Lubbock Chamber of Commerce in Texas that Americans need to learn to ""live with"" the virus, using safety measures such as masks so the economy can remain open. 
Rosengren said the parts of the country that enacted longer shutdowns earlier in the crisis were now benefiting from better health outcomes and more robust spending. States that lifted restrictions too quickly saw a short-lived increase in economic activity, which became muted after a rise in infections, he said. 
""Limited or inconsistent efforts by states to control the virus based on public health guidance are not only placing citizens at unnecessary risk of severe illness and possible death – but are also likely to prolong the economic downturn,"" Rosengren said. 
Kaplan said he expects the U.S. unemployment rate to remain elevated at 9% at the end of the year, but noted it could be lower if businesses and consumers take steps to control the virus. The unemployment rate in July was 10.2%.
""If we don’t follow that, while people may feel freer, the economy will grow slower,"" Kaplan said.
Referring to the Fed's Main Street Lending Program, which is meant to carry small and medium-sized businesses through the crisis, Rosengren said that low early use of the program was not a sign of failure and that more businesses may turn to the facility in the fall if the economy worsens. 
Asked about the rise in U.S. government debt, Rosengren said he supports strong fiscal stimulus but cautioned it must be paired with efforts to contain the virus. 

""If you want to actually make sure that the debt doesn't explode, you have to make sure that we get the pandemic under control,"" Rosengren said.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina will formally submit its amended debt restructuring offer to the U.S. securities regulator as early as Thursday, two sources said, a key step to sealing a deal after an initial agreement was reached with creditors earlier this month.
The sources said that the proposal would be sent to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after creditors and the government ironed out the wording of the official document. The current deadline for accepting the deal is Aug. 24.
The first person close to the negotiations said that the proposal ""should go tomorrow"" while a second person said that some minor elements were still being worked out but that, ""We should have no problem doing it this week"".
Both asked not to be named as the process is confidential.
The formalization of the revised offer would bolster hopes that a final deal will be reached to restructure around $65 billion in foreign debt, that would help avoid a messy legal battle and help Argentina dig itself out of default.

Argentina and its main creditor groups reached an agreement in principle on Aug. 4 to restructure the debt after months of talks, breaking an impasse over the terms of the deal that had threatened to derail the negotiation.

LONDON (Reuters) - A key euro zone interbank money-market rate is trading below the European Central Bank's own official rate for the first time in over five months, a sign of the vast amount of cash that has been poured into the system to combat the COVID-19 crisis.
The ECB has flooded the system with so much liquidity that the rate at which banks borrow from each other -- Euribor -- is within a whisker of a record low. 
Three-month Euribor  was trading on Wednesday at minus 0.486%, and in what is a rare occurrence – this rate is now below the ECB’s own euro overnight indexed swap (OIS) , which was trading at minus minus 0.47%.
""The system is so flooded with liquidity that banks are essentially telling you they don't need the money,"" said Peter Chatwell, head of rates at Mizuho. 
The situation is very different from late March, when Euribor rose to -0.16% and the spread over OIS was at its widest since the 2012 euro zone debt crisis, a sign of severe stress in the system. 
Global policymakers have pumped in more than $20 trillion in stimulus in response to the coronavirus pandemic, and the ECB has massively raised its bond buying scheme and provided vast quantities of cheap loans to banks. 
These loans, known as targeted long term refinancing operations (TLTROs), were made easier to access in March this year, possibly resulting in banks borrowing more than they needed and sitting on too much cash, said Antoine Bouvet, a strategist at ING Bank in London.
The ECB was not immediately available for comment.
But Olek Gajowniczek, a trader at Japanese bank Nomura, said that in his view the negative spread won't prompt a change in the ECB's policy stance. ""Global central banks remain in accommodative mode,"" he added.

""The numbers are coming in very, very nicely,"" National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told Fox Business Network, adding that data suggested a jump in COVID-19 cases over the summer put only ""a slight restraint on the economy.""
Asked if that meant a stalemate in talks over another relief bill would hurt the economy, Kudlow said: ""I don't think so."" He said he believed only ""targeted money"" was needed now.
Speaking to reporters at the White House, Kudlow declined to comment specifically on the status of the stalled talks between the Republican administration and Democrats on Capitol Hill, but he suggested the White House had little appetite for a big bill.
He said executive actions taken by U.S. President Donald Trump over the weekend to defer payroll taxes and provide federal aid to the unemployed would give the economy a shot in the arm.
""The executive orders provide considerable assistance and economic growth incentives,"" Kudlow told Fox Business. ""So, we can stay with that as we are entering what I think is a self-sustaining economic recovery.""

Experts said Trump's actions would do little to boost the economy even if he can overcome legal questions about his decision to sidestep Congress.

(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) on Wednesday said the Surface Duo, its dual-screen smartphone powered by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Android operating system, will start at a price of $1,399 and arrive in stores beginning Sept. 10.
The Surface Duo folds closed like a book. Unlike devices such as Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd's Galaxy Z Fold 2 that use special flexible glass to create a single display, the Duo has two traditional screens separated by a hinge but synchronized to work together.
At a media briefing ahead of the Surface Duo announcement, Microsoft executives positioned the phone as a tool for getting work done with its productivity apps, similar to how many business users employ dual-monitor setups with PCs.
In the company's Teams chat app, for example, a video chat occupies one screen while the other screen displays chats. In Microsoft's Outlook email app, clicking a link in the body of an email opens the link on the opposite screen, so the user can continue reading or responding to the email.
""I'm not trying to reinvent the phone,"" Panos Panay, Microsoft's chief product officer, told reporters. ""But I do believe this is a better way to get things done.""
The dual-screen setup also allows users to pair up non-Microsoft apps, such as running social networks Twitter and Instagram side by side. Panay said that one of Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella's favorite combinations was using Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Kindle app to read books while taking notes with a stylus in Microsoft's OneNote app on the other screen.
Panay said Microsoft chose Google's operating system because it would give users access to Android's large ecosystem of mobile apps. ""Having the Play Store is critical,"" he said.
Microsoft said pre-orders for the device begin Wednesday at its own site, AT&T Inc and BestBuy Co Inc.
Devices will work on wireless networks from AT&T,  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc.

The device does not have 5G connectivity and is only available in the United States at launch. Microsoft gave no timeline for other markets.

1215,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 11:26AM ET</span>",Next Lebanon government to face $30 billion reform test,"By Tom Arnold and Ghaida Ghantous
LONDON/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon may be in line for $298 million in emergency aid after the Beirut port blast, but the more than $30 billion that some estimate it may need to rebuild its shattered economy will not be forthcoming without reform.
Such change could be stalled by the resignation of Lebanon's government, while a financial rescue plan drawn up in April is likely to have to be reviewed and possibly even ditched by a new administration, two financial sources close to the plan said.
Forecasts for financial metrics such as debt-to-GDP and the parallel exchange rate contained in the rescue plan, which had already struggled for support before last week's deadly explosion, now look unrealistic, one of the sources added.
That is likely to push back creditor talks to restructure Lebanon's international sovereign debt.
Lebanon had begun International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout talks in May after defaulting on its foreign currency debt. But these were put on hold due to a lack of progress on reforms and differences over the size of financial losses.
While Prime Minister Hassan Diab's cabinet remains as a caretaker government after its resignation, Lebanon's already diminishing foreign reserves are set to be eroded faster to pay for the rebuilding of Beirut's port and other infrastructure.
So devising a credible economic plan will be the main test for whoever ends up running Lebanon, which faces tumbling net capital flows amid an intensifying scramble for hard currency.
""The best gauge of the government's sovereignty will be the economic plan they draft,"" Carlos Abadi, an adviser to the Association of Banks in Lebanon, told Reuters.
In the wake of the Aug. 4 explosion, Lebanon's external financing needs for the next four years swelled to more than $30 billion from $24 billion, Garbis Iradian at the Institute of International Finance (IIF) estimated.
""In order to overcome the U.S. veto at the IMF, the next government will have to produce a plan which is premised on the positioning of the economy for future growth, without the possibility of billions being diverted for nefarious purposes,"" Abadi said.
The IMF reaffirmed its support for Lebanon on Sunday, before the government's resignation, but also the need for reforms, a point stressed by French President Emmanuel Macron last week.
With the number of Lebanese living in poverty nearing half its population, these reforms range from setting up social safety nets to protect the most vulnerable to ensuring Lebanon's wealthy elite share the burden of financial losses from bank recapitalisations. 
Macron also called for an audit of the central bank and the banking system, a comment that has triggered wariness among some bankers fearful that the government may use the data to spare ""family and friends"".
French MP Loïc Kervran, chair of the France-Lebanon committee, told Reuters such an audit would aim to uncover ""unorthodox"" practices which could have led to losses.
SWORD OF DAMOCLES
Foreign donors have made it clear that apart from humanitarian aid, no money would be given to Lebanon without reforms.
President Michel Aoun pledged on Wednesday that the government's resignation would not hold up the process of a forensic central bank audit.
Some countries are particularly concerned about the influence of Iran through Hezbollah, a Shi'ite Muslim political group and guerrilla army designated as a terrorist organisation by the United States. Hezbollah helped form Diab's government.
Economist Toufic Gaspard said that as long as Hezbollah controlled the levers of power, economic recovery would be hampered as the group would not accept reforms such as border and customs controls.
""This is the sword of Damocles hanging above everybody's head...If this situation is not addressed, I don't see how we can have a sustainable solution,"" added Gaspard, who has advised the IMF and the Lebanese finance ministry.
Meanwhile, with limited external funding support, surging inflation and the parallel exchange rate plummeting to 9,290 pounds per U.S. dollar by 2021 under a worst-case scenario, Lebanon will continue to sink, said the IIF's Iradian.
Lebanon's central bank has told local banks to extend zero-interest U.S. dollar loans to those impacted by the blast for repairs, which analysts say will come from official reserves.
These could fall by $6 to $7 billion by the end of 2020 from around $18 billion, said Nafez Zouk at Oxford Economics.

""Lebanon would be running out of usable reserves"".

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's government has negotiated an agreement with Chinese banks for a grace period until the end of the year on some $19 billion in loans that are paid off with oil shipments, according to three sources in Caracas with knowledge of the situation.
The government of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez borrowed more than $50 billion from China through the oil-for-loan arrangements, which were mainly underwritten by the state-owned China Development Bank. Chavez's successor, President Nicolas Maduro, stopped making the associated payments as the South American OPEC nation's economy unraveled.
The grace period was the result of talks that Caracas sought with Beijing earlier this year to seek financial support amid the tumble in oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic, according to the sources, who asked not be identified.
""This (arrangement) will be in place until at least December, and then they will re-evaluate it,"" said one of the sources.
Venezuela's information ministry and state oil company PDVSA, along with China Development Bank, did not reply to requests for comment.
The spokesperson's office at China's foreign ministry, in a faxed reply to Reuters' questions, said: ""I am not aware of the situation that you are saying. I would like to stress that China and Venezuela have a long history of practical cooperation.""
Without the grace period, Maduro's government would have to make some $3 billion in payments this year - equivalent to a quarter of 2019 crude exports. Local economists estimate Venezuela's 2020 oil export revenue will be around $4 billion.
Ecuador last week said it had won a grace period on a credit line with the China Development Bank, allowing it to postpone $417 million in payments for one year.
Venezuela since last year has been unable to meet its obligations on the loans, in part due to U.S. sanctions meant to force Maduro from power that create penalties for companies that buy Venezuelan crude.
Chinese state oil company CNPC has stopped buying crude directly from PDVSA as a result of the sanctions, according to three other Venezuelan sources with knowledge of the situation.
""This helps, but it does not alleviate the cash flow problem,"" said one of the sources. 
In 2016, Maduro's government negotiated a grace period that allowed it to make interest-only payments on the debt, a deal that lasted for at least a year, according to the sources. https://reut.rs/3kBCY11, https://reut.rs/2XTphR7
China, which was Venezuela's largest financier during the Chavez era, stopped delivering fresh funds to Venezuela seven years ago.

Maduro earlier this year said Venezuela was receiving personal protection equipment and medical advice from China to confront the COVID-19 pandemic, part of a broader Chinese effort to provide assistance in Latin America.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The government of Oman has signed a one-year $2 billion bridge loan with a group of international and regional banks, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.
The loan, which will be repaid with money raised from an international bond issuance, will bolster state coffers hit by low oil prices and the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus crisis.
The Omani finance ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Sources had previously told Reuters, Oman chose First Abu Dhabi Bank and Bank Muscat to coordinate the loan.
Oman could issue a bond in the next six months to repay the loan ""as long as the market is there,"" one of those sources said.
The pricing was ""relatively cheaper than the market"" and the loan's structure will see the pricing stepped up over time, the source said.
Oman is a relatively small crude oil producer burdened by high levels of debt, making it more vulnerable to oil price swings than most of its wealthier Gulf neighbours.
Oman's fiscal deficit could widen to 16.9% of gross domestic product this year from a 7% deficit last year, the International Monetary Fund has estimated.
In June, ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) downgraded Oman deeper into junk territory to Ba3 from Ba2, citing risks related to its financing needs and diminishing buffers.
It has over $10 billion in external debt due in 2021 and 2022 that could add pressure to foreign exchange reserves if it is not rolled over.

Oman had said it planned to raise over $5 billion in debt this year to partly cover an estimated deficit of $6.5 billion, but that was before the pandemic and the oil price crash.

More than 500 migrants have arrived on British beaches in recent days, with many fleeing poverty, persecution or war in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria.
That has prompted a reaction from the government, who have asked the military to help, urged France to stop the boats at source, and even appointed a ""Clandestine Channel Threat Commander"" to lead efforts to prevent crossings.
A frostily worded Twitter thread from Unilever-owned (L:ULVR) Ben and Jerry's tagged interior minister Priti Patel, and cited several media reports about the plight of those who undertake the dangerous 21-mile crossing in overloaded dinghies.
""Hey @PritiPatel we think the real crisis is our lack of humanity for people fleeing war, climate change and torture,"" the brand's UK account tweeted. 
Ben & Jerry's was acquired by  Unilever  (NYSE:UL) in 2000 in a unique deal that allows it to operate with more autonomy than other subsidiaries. 
It uses that freedom to pursue a cultural and social mission that has recently included strongly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. It also supports marriage equality and electoral campaign finance reform. 
While Patel has not directly replied to the migration thread, fellow minister James Cleverly responded: ""Can I have a large scoop of statistically inaccurate virtue-signalling with my grossly overpriced ice cream please?""
He did not say what inaccuracies he was referring to. Unilever and Ben & Jerry's were not immediately available to comment.

Some of the arrivals stand a chance of being granted asylum, while others, considered illegal economic migrants, are unlikely to be allowed to remain in Britain.

Brazil is on course to post a record 800 billion reais ($115 billion) budget deficit this year due to crisis-fighting expenditure, swelling the national debt to a high of around 95% of gross domestic product - an exceptional level for an emerging market economy.
Barring a dramatic surge in revenues or an expenditure squeeze, the spending cap - which limits growth in non-obligatory government outlays to the rate of inflation - will be broken next year. 
The government will present its 2021 budget later this month. The ceiling is 1.485 trillion reais ($275 billion), only 31 bln reais more than this year. That leaves hardly any room for maneuver in normal times, never mind the extra social, health and investment spending needed in a pandemic.
Economy Minister Paulo Guedes and many economists say the cap, passed during the presidency of Michel Temer in 2016, is the foundation on which Brazil's fiscal credibility is built. The belief that it will not be breached has compressed market-based interest rates and given the central bank room to cut official rates to a record low of 2.00%, they say.
But several market-based rates show scant evidence of these fears, and the case for maintaining or even increasing deficit spending to mitigate the biggest economic crash on record is compelling, many others say.
Congress already passed an emergency 'war budget' this year worth around 600 billion reais, which is exempt from normal budget rules like the spending cap. 
""Just as the market has learned to live with an 800 billion reais deficit, it can learn to live with a conversation about modifying the spending cap. It's inevitable it will be changed in some way,"" said Jose Francisco Goncalves, chief economist at Banco Fator in Sao Paulo.
Crucially, just 3 percent of Brazil's total $1.45 trillion debt is in foreign currency, according to the Bank for International Settlements. That is one of the lowest levels in emerging markets - leaving the government less exposed to currency fluctuations than in the past. 
Within that, over 90% is owed to its own citizens, according to Treasury figures, meaning the government is also less exposed to changes in sentiment among foreign investors.

Graphic: Brazil foreign debt - BIS https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwvkemllvm/BISEM2.png
And if a debt crisis were to arise, Brazil has a warchest of $334 billion in foreign currency reserves to fight it. That is more than 20% of GDP, high by international standards. 
As long as Brazilians are prepared to lend to the government - and there is no evidence to the contrary - it can bend its rules, help millions of its citizens through a savage recession, and provide much-needed economic stimulus. 
""People said there was no money. Then 600 billion reais appeared from nowhere, and it's all right. Money creation is just a question of what it is for,"" said Goncalves.
RETHINKING DEFICITS
Some analysts say the fixation with deficit and debt reduction is a legacy of crises past. As recently as the 1990s Brazil experienced hyperinflation of 7,000%, and a painful currency and debt crisis. 
""People in Brazil think that big deficits will create a confidence crisis which will lift short-term interest rates and then you can't finance your budget. But what we are seeing is the opposite,"" said a budget analyst in Brasilia, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""People think big deficits will create inflationary pressures. But this doesn't make any sense because right now we have massive unemployment and huge spare capacity,"" he said. 
For many economists, Brazil is part of the global trend since the Great Financial Crisis of tepid growth, low inflation, and plunging interest rates, despite ballooning budget deficits.
The real yield on Brazil's five-year inflation-linked bonds is just 1.55%, less than pre-coronavirus levels of over 2%. The real interest rate on January 2022 rate futures, accounting for market inflation forecasts, is negative. The real benchmark 'Selic' rate is also now negative.

This suggests financial markets believe the record budget deficit poses little inflation, interest rate or government financing risk, despite the public and often noisy debate.
The government insists Brazil cannot afford to keep the fiscal taps running. But it may be that it cannot afford not to, according to a working paper by PhD student Marina Sanches and professor Laura Carvalho at the University of Sao Paulo, which looks at current fiscal policy in the wake of the 1997-2018 period. 
They found that if government investment had been held constant since its fiscal consolidation plan started in 2015, GDP in 2017 would have been 1.4% higher. If federal investment had expanded at the same average pace as in the 2006-10 period, GDP would have been 6.7% higher.
Output would be 2.5% lower if social benefits had not grown in 2016 and 2017 due to tight spending controls, they said.

After leaving the European Union earlier this year Britain is trying to tie up swift trade deals with major partners like the United States to capitalize on its new freedom to strike bilateral deals rather than EU-wide ones.
""Positive progress continues to be made in many of the areas covered by an agreement,"" the British trade department said in a statement. 
""Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to negotiating a comprehensive and ambitious agreement. In terms of the timeline of negotiations, it was agreed that they should continue at pace throughout the Autumn.""
Nevertheless, the government said international trade minister Liz Truss had told her U.S. counterparts that retaliatory tariffs imposed on EU goods - which still impact British goods like Scotch Whisky - were unacceptable and should be removed. 
Total trade between the two countries was valued at 232.7 billion pounds in 2019, according to British statistics.
The next round of talks is in early September, and will see both sides exchange their first market access offers. Britain says that while it wants a quick deal, it is not willing to set a target date for one because it does not want time pressure used against it.
The most recent round of negotiations saw texts exchanged on rules of origin - the criteria used to determine the source of a good, and therefore which duties and regulation should apply. There was also detailed discussion of intellectual property rules.

1222,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 06:38AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday, August 12th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate. Bond yields and the dollar rise ahead of the release of consumer price inflation data for July and a big 10-year note sale later. The U.K. had the worst contraction of all G7 countries in the second quarter, but sterling isn't fazed. And oil prices recover on the back of a strong set of inventory numbers, with more of the same from the EIA to come, as well as OPEC's monthly report. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, August 12th.
1, Dollar, Treasury yields rise ahead of big 10-year note sale, CPI
The dollar hit its highest level in two weeks and U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hit their highest in over a month, while Gold Futures stabilized after their 5% drop on Tuesday.
The rise in 10-year yields came ahead of a big auction of notes due at 1 PM ET (1700 GMT) that will provide a stiff test of the market’s ability to satisfy the borrowing demands of a government whose deficit has more than doubled from a year earlier.
By 6:30 AM ET, the benchmark 10-year note yielded 0.66%, just off its intraday high and a full 16 basis points above its lows of last week.
The rise in bond yields had been triggered by signs of higher-than-expected factory gate inflation in Tuesday’s PPI release. That suggests the market could be vulnerable to any negative surprises from the consumer price index for July that will be release at 8:30 AM ET. Last month’s 0.6% increase was the biggest monthly rise in seven years. Analysts expect a rise of 0.3% this month.
2. Biden picks Kamala Harris
The Democratic Party’s presidential candidate Joe Biden picked California Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, in a move that appeared to shore up support among women and ethnic minorities, and to reassure centrist voters that the party’s progressive wing won’t have undue influence on policy if Biden is elected in November.
The choice of Harris, a former state attorney general, also arguably limits the vulnerability of Biden’s campaign to claims that it can’t defend law and order, a key campaign issue given the backdrop of widespread violence in Portland and other cities this summer.
Reports noted that Harris has been a big recipient of donations from Silicon Valley in the past, which may feed speculation that a Democratic administration may avoid confrontation with giants such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on antitrust issues.
3. Stocks set to rebound; Tesla's stock split, Tencent's earnings in focus
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher after Tuesday’s abrupt sell-off, when the rise in bond yields reintroduced the almost forgotten notion of discount rates back into stock valuations.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow 30 futures contract was up 273 points, or 1.0%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was up 0.8% and the Nasdaq 100 contract was up 1.0%.
Stocks likely to be in focus in early trade include Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which rose 6% in after-hours trading after the company announced a five-for-one stock split. Such a step makes no difference to the company’s market value by itself, but arguably supports it at the margins by broadening its appeal to smaller investors.
Also in focus will be Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), which won an important antitrust ruling on Tuesday, and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), whose earnings easily outstripped expectations in the quarter, allaying fears of U.S. sanctions against its WeChat messaging system.
 4. U.K. gets the biggest Covid-19 hit of all
The U.K. economy contracted by over 20% in the second quarter, the most of any major industrialized economy. The contraction was the result of a late and botched reaction to the first wave of the coronavirus, and also a reflection of the higher share of services in GDP relative to other economies.
Services have been particularly hard hit by lockdown measures and have also been slower to rebound.
Monthly data for June showed GDP, industrial production and construction output all recovering more quickly than expected, however. That limited losses in sterling against both the euro and dollar, while the two main U.K. stock indexes were mixed.
 5. Oil bounces as inventory data support; OPEC report eyed
Crude oil prices rebounded from Tuesday’s lows, which were largely a function of developments in other assets.
By 6:30, U.S. crude futures were up 1.5% at $42.23 a barrel, while the international marker Brent was up 1.4% at $45.12 a barrel.
The market was underpinned by another reasonably strong set of numbers from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday, which indicated a 4.4 million-barrel draw in U.S. crude stocks last week, more than expected and enough to suggest the recovery in U.S. fuel demand is still intact.
The government’s data on weekly crude stockpiles is due at 10:30 AM ET, while the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will publish its monthly report on the world market sometime earlier."
1223,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",Majority of Scots support independence from UK - YouGov poll,"LONDON (Reuters) - A majority of Scots support independence from the United Kingdom, a YouGov poll found on Wednesday, with support for nationalists bolstered by a much more positive view of how they have responded to COVID-19 compared with London.
The poll for the Times newspaper found that 53% of people would vote for Scottish independence in a referendum, up 2 percentage points from January and the highest level of support for independence recorded by YouGov.
It is the latest poll to suggest rising support for Scottish independence and could strengthen calls for another vote on the matter, after Scots rejected it in a 2014 referendum by 55%-45%.
The Scottish National Party, who run the devolved administration in the nation, insist they have the right to call another vote. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the 2014 referendum was decisive and should be respected.
The poll also suggested the SNP were on course for an unprecedented majority in the Scottish Parliament in elections next year, setting up a possible constitutional clash with Westminster.
Much of the increase in support appeared to be linked to diverging views of the leadership in Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole. Some 72% of respondents agreed Scottish First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was doing very or fairly well, while only 20% said that for Johnson. 
The YouGov Poll found 52% of voters believed Scotland was going in the right direction, up 20 percentage points from when the question was last asked a year ago.
Sturgeon's Scottish Government has responsibility for health policy, and she has been more cautious than Johnson in easing lockdown.
Scotland, which holds about 10% of the UK's population, has had no deaths from COVID-19 since mid-July. The UK, which uses a broader methodology to count deaths that is being reviewed, as a whole has recorded 1,362 deaths in that time.
YouGov polled 1,142 adults between August 6-10.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - ABN Amro (AS:ABNd) is to end all trade and commodity financing after a string of losses, in a massive overhaul of its activities that will see the Dutch bank cut 800 jobs.
Shares in ABN, which had lost almost half their value this year, were up 6.8% at 0925 GMT after it said its corporate bank will retreat to northwest Europe, exiting the United States, Asia, Australia and Brazil, except for clearing operations.
""We are over-exposed to global sectors and we had more than our fair share of exceptional client files"", Robert Swaak, who became chief executive in April, told reporters on Wednesday.
ABN, in which the Dutch state still has a 56% stake, will focus on areas where it has significant scale, he added, including local energy markets, where the European Union's ""green deal"" is expected to lead to huge demand for finance.
The restructuring will affect around 45% of client loans, worth 18 billion euros ($21 billion) and follows several failed attempts to increase the profitability of the corporate bank, which has grappled with losses in offshore energy markets.
""Finally what we wanted"",  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts wrote in a note.
Several other European banks have been rethinking their trade and commodity finance operations, including  Natixis  (PA:CNAT) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) after energy trading losses and a shift to greener finance initiatives.
IMPAIRMENTS
Write-offs at ABN's corporate bank hit 1.4 billion euros in the first half, up from 128 million euros a year before, as oil and gas sector loans soured along with the economic outlook and large Asian clients got into trouble.
In China, ABN was lead arranger of a $430 million syndicated loan for two companies under the Fangyuan group, which had liquidity problems last year.
It also had nearly $300 million in outstanding loans to Singapore-based Hin Leong Trading, whose founder admitted to hiding hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. 
""This has been the higher risk and more volatile part of the bank, which is why we are choosing to wind it down"", Chief Financial Officer Clifford Abrahams told Reuters.
The clearing and European parts which ABN aims to keep, however, were not without their own problems as impairments jumped to 591 million euros in the second quarter.
This was partly due to a ""potential fraud case"" in Germany, where ABN had a significant exposure to Wirecard (DE:WDIG).
ABN took a $200 million first quarter loss on clearing after a U.S. hedge fund missed its margin requirements.
ABN said impairments led to an overall net loss of 5 million euros in the second quarter, which was not as bad as analyst expectations for a loss of 46 million euros.

The EU first announced the move in February and the bloc's Brussels-based executive said on Wednesday Cambodia made no amends since then, meaning the decision was now effective. 
""The Cambodian authorities should take action to restore political freedoms in the country, to re-establish the necessary conditions for a credible, democratic opposition and to initiate a process of national reconciliation through genuine and inclusive dialogue,"" the European Commission said.

Sunak said growth of 8.7% in gross domestic product in June was encouraging, even as official data showed the economy contracted by 20.4% in the second quarter as a whole.
Sunak told broadcasters there was too much uncertainty to know if Britain would have a swift, V-shaped economic recovery.
""What we do know is that there are promising signs,"" he said. ""There's still work to do and even as we recover many people are going to lose their jobs, already have lost their jobs, and we need to make sure that we are constantly focused on providing new opportunities for those people.""
Sunak reiterated his opposition to extending the government's huge job retention scheme which is due to expire at the end of October. Economists expect a sharp rise in unemployment as the state-funded jobs subsidies end.
Sunak also said he expected to see more people returning to their workplace in the coming weeks after the government recently changed its guidance.
On Brexit, he said good progress had been made in several areas of the negotiations for a trade deal with the European Union but there were gaps on ""a couple of big issues.""
He said asking Brussels for an extension of Britain's no-change transition period - which is due to expire on Dec. 31 - was not the right thing to do and the government had to prepare for all eventualities

1227,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 02:05AM ET</span>",Column: Markets second-guess policy rollback - Mike Dolan,"By Mike Dolan
LONDON (Reuters) - The once resolute ""whatever it takes"" message of government support for pandemic-hit economies is fraying at the margins as some recovery from the COVID-19 shock emerges, leaving buoyant markets pondering the prospect of ebbing stimulus.
Government ministers are starting to stress that borrowing can't keep rising at this year's pace for much longer, even though winding down fiscal action at a time when the rebound is incomplete, and the virus still spreading, could be jarring.
But investors insist that leaves central banks back doing the heavy lifting once more, suppressing borrowing rates for years to come to keep affordable the highest stock of developed world government debt relative to output since just after World War Two, and regardless of any pickup in inflation.
And the deeply negative long-term ""real"", or inflation-adjusted, borrowing rates this delivers - currently below -1% in the United States and parts of the euro zone on a 10-year horizon - has already supercharged the parallel surge in equities, bonds, gold and property over recent weeks.
While forecasters such as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) have scaled back the extent of their expected 2020 economic contractions, their interest rate horizon barely changes at all.
""We expect monetary policy to remain highly supportive, with no hikes from the Fed until early 2025,"" Goldman's chief U.S. economist Jan Hatzius told clients on Monday.
What's more, market pricing still hasn't ruled out the possibility of Federal Reserve policy rates going negative over that horizon despite routine pushback from Fed policymakers.
But that easy money vista is starting to mirror signs of fiscal exhaustion.

HITTING THE BUFFERS
After months of governments insisting they would spend any amount of money to protect business, jobs and incomes hit by pandemic lockdowns, signs of recovery as restrictions have lifted this summer have prompted a change of tone.
Congress and the White House hit the buffers this weekend in talks on rolling over additional income support and on how much is needed to keep the economy moving.
Unilateral White House action is bridging the gap as talks are likely to resume, but U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is already intent on flagging the limits of what's likely.
Pushing back against congressional Democrats' demand for another spending tranche in excess of $3 trillion, Mnuchin said Washington needed to be ""careful about not piling on enormous amount of debts for future generations"".
His British counterpart Rishi Sunak, arguing against the extension of the UK government's job furlough scheme beyond October, echoed the sentiments last Friday by saying government couldn't keep borrowing at this year's rate.
""That's not something we can or should sustain,"" Sunak said.
So much for ""whatever it takes"".
Many investors insist the more cautious spending tone is merely commensurate with the recovery in activity and spending would ratchet higher again if there were another severe downturn due to new virus restrictions or a long delay in a vaccine.
Sonal Desai, Fixed Income Chief Investment Officer at Franklin Templeton, says policymakers had shown themselves to be incredibly flexible and she doesn't doubt they would step up again if needed.
But she said markets would need to prepare for some volatility when fiscal and monetary supports end, and this would help decide how much of market pricing is based on reasonable recovery expectations and how much is artificially supported by temporary policy stimuli.
""The Fed can't do this indefinitely,"" she said. ""Not unless you see Japan-style deflation.""
And, not for the first time, it's the fear of stimulus distortions in financial markets that may be the most powerful argument for rethinking the scale of monetary support over time.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts this week flagged how the investment world's aggregate ""duration"" - or sensitivity to interest rate moves - was at unprecedented levels.
They pointed out the duration of global catch-all bond indexes had risen about 5% in two years to record highs as firms and governments used record low rates to extend maturities.
But it was also true in equities, where exposure to consumer discretionary sectors, dominated by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), had the highest negative correlation to U.S. real yields. The supercharged technology sector is close behind, and both sectors are rising proportions of broad equity and bond market capitalization.
""Globally, investors hold $8.1 trillion more of these yield-sensitive sectors than they did just about 18 months ago,"" the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.
Even the hedge of gold and silver, which have also been surging of late, may be a real rate expression and hence long duration, they conclude.
Whether that potentially dangerous market skew makes central banks rethink easy policies soon or whether it traps them there to avoid disruption is the crucial question over the year ahead.

1228,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 01:55AM ET</span>",Ticking Timebomb? Thousands of Australian mortgages propped up by virus benefits,"By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Nearly 20,000 Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) mortgages are held by people receiving jobless benefits due to COVID-19, raising concerns for the economy of possible forced property sales and sharp house price declines once support runs out.
The data, released by the country's biggest bank along with its annual profit announcement on Wednesday, shows Australia's A$7.2 trillion housing market is being propped up by temporary relief payments for people left jobless by shutdowns to stop the virus spreading.
That raises the risk of a sharp downturn in house prices when the payments stop and banks call in loans they deferred for coronavirus-impacted borrowers. Already the Australian government has extended a COVID jobless benefit by three months to December, at a reduced rate.
""It's a real timebomb,"" said Richard Holden, an economics professor at University of New South Wales.
""One of the tricky things for the banks is how aggressive they're going to be in enforcing loans.""
About 1.3 million Australians have applied for the COVID jobless benefit, called JobSeeker, according to government figures, while economists estimate at least another 6 million people - a quarter of the population - are having their wages subsidised by a separate relief package for shuttered companies.
CBA, which has a quarter of Australian home loans, said it had deferrals currently on about 135,000 mortgages, or 8% of its book. Of those deferred loans, 14% involved borrowers receiving JobSeeker benefits and nearly half that number had no other income earner to help service it.
""If many of those were forced to sell, it would have a notable impact on the market,"" said David Bassanese, chief economist at BetaShares Exchange Traded Funds.
""If you've got desperate sellers or forced sales, it could have a depressing effect on prices. That is the big risk: do (banks) keep deferring? Someone's got to pay for this.""
RISK OF STEEP HOUSING DOWNTURN
CBA, which has said house prices could fall nearly a third by the end of 2022, said it was contacting all customers with deferred mortgages to discuss options like returning to full or part payment, or converting their loans to interest only.
""Deferrals ... have provided obviously significant support and flexibility for customers,"" CBA Chief Executive Officer Matt Comyn said on an analyst call.
""The test is going to be how effectively we can make the orderly transition away from repayment deferrals,"" he added.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said he expects to keep offering some form of COVID-specific jobless payment after the current cut-off.
A housing downturn could further damage the economy, with the pandemic sending the nation spiralling into recession for the first time since 1991.
For now, house prices have stayed relatively unaffected, with nationwide prices down a total of about 1% through May and June, although still up nearly 8% from a year earlier, according to property consultant CoreLogic. [https://reut.rs/2XUZBDY]
Nationwide auction clearance rates are about two-thirds, down from about three quarters a year earlier, but higher than in other recent dips.
""We're expecting a fall, but we're not expecting that big of a fall,"" said St George Bank senior economist Janu Chan.

""You still have some sort of support measures and there is also the possibility we could get some more.""

1229,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>",Head of World’s Largest Pension Fund Looks Beyond Sovereign Debt,"(Bloomberg) -- The head of the world’s largest pension fund said he is looking beyond the safety of sovereign debt as an era of falling rates forces even the most conservative of investors to rethink playbooks.
Masataka Miyazono, the president of Japan’s mammoth Government Pension Investment Fund with 162.1 trillion yen ($1.5 trillion) in assets, said the fund is looking at a range of foreign debt as it sought to steady returns in pandemic-riven markets, after it swung from a record loss to a historic gain in the first six months of 2020.
“We’re going to increase the sophistication of our investment, while closely monitoring the risk-return,” Miyazono, 67, said in an interview in Tokyo on Tuesday. “Apart from foreign sovereign bonds there’s also mortgage debt, corporate debt to consider.”
Among the options for the the GPIF, as the fund is known, could be to redeploy funds parked in short-term Treasuries into riskier assets after global sovereign yields dropped to record lows. The fund is also eying European debt going ahead following the European Union’s agreement on a recovery fund, he said.
“Apart from Treasuries, there’s also European debt, which is more difficult from a currency perspective,” he said. “The EU’s recovery fund is a point of progress to keep in mind, and we’ll see if this is just a short-term move or a move toward reassessing the EU bloc.”
Miyazono could scarcely have taken over the top job at a more challenging time. Appointed just days after the worst of the coronavirus market chaos in March, one of his first public appearances was to announce the fund’s record 17.7 trillion yen loss, a sensitive political topic that makes headlines in an aging nation where social security is a major concern.
New Portfolio
Miyazono’s time in charge has coincided with the fund making its biggest changes to its asset allocations in years. The fund swung to a record quarterly gain in the three months ended June, and there are no plans in place to alter the fund’s portfolio, Miyazono said.
“Markets are volatile at the moment, so it is more challenging than normal to manage the portfolio,” Miyazono acknowledged. “But we’re a long-term investor. I think the key is to remain loyal to your basic portfolio.”
A new portfolio boosted GPIF’s allocation of foreign bonds by 10 percentage points to 25%, and followed an earlier move that allowed it to classify currency-hedged foreign bonds as part of its domestic debt portfolio. Asked about its stance on the hedged debt, Miyazono was cautious.
“I don’t think it’ll be a straightforward operation where we just cut holdings of Japanese government bonds and add to foreign debt,” he said. “We would obviously have to consider currency rate effects as well.”
Other public pension funds in Japan tend to align their asset allocations with GPIF, which also provides a lead for large insurers. They are also increasingly turning to overseas debt markets, and venturing beyond sovereign debt into corporate bonds. But Miyazono still likes U.S. debt.
“Given the market size and liquidity, it’s easier to invest in Treasuries,” he said.
Agriculture Lender
A graduate of Tokyo University’s elite law department, Miyazono spent most of his career at Norinchukin Bank, an agricultural lender and major institutional investor. He took over the GPIF without the ability to lean on rock-star investment chief Hiromichi Mizuno, who departed just as Miyazono was appointed.
One of Mizuno’s final moves was to suspend lending of foreign stocks, a step he linked to short-selling being inconsistent with the fund’s stewardship code. Miyazono said the decision could be reviewed in the future.
“If the environment changes we may have the opportunity to review our position,” he said, “but we’re not in that situation at the moment.”
Mizuno was replaced as chief investment officer by the more reticent Eiji Ueda, a figure less well-known to international investors. Miyazono, however, praised Ueda’s management skills and market savvy.

“In the four months that I’ve worked with him, I can honestly say he was the right pick,” Miyazono said.

The Reserve Bank increased its Large Scale Asset Purchase program to as much as NZ$100 billion ($65 billion) from NZ$60 billion, and extended it until June 2022, according to a statement Wednesday in Wellington.

New Zealand’s economy has performed better than expected after the country’s initial success in wiping out the coronavirus. But the emergence yesterday of the first local cases in more than three months has dealt a blow to the outlook as largest city Auckland is placed back into lockdown. With the pandemic continuing to rage globally, the central bank noted downside risks.
“The severe global economic disruption caused by the pandemic is persisting,” it said. “Any significant change in the global and domestic economic outlook remains dependent on the containment of the virus, which is highly uncertain as evidenced today by the return to social restrictions in New Zealand.”
The New Zealand dollar fell to a one-month low after the announcement. It fell as low as 65.25 U.S. cents from 65.67 cents beforehand.

The “one area we are engaging is trade,” Kudlow said at a White House press conference. “It’s fine right now.”
China continues to promise to implement the phase-one trade and the evidence shows they are increasing purchases, especially of commodities, Kudlow said.
In January, China promised to buy an additional $200 billion of U.S. goods and services over the 2017 level by the end of 2021. That agreement paused a bruising trade war between the world’s two largest economies, although the relationship has deteriorated on almost every other front since then.

By the end of June China had only bought about 23% of the total purchase target for 2020 of more than $170 billion in goods, according to Bloomberg calculations based on Chinese data. Senior U.S. and Chinese officials are planning to assess the implementation of the trade agreement on or around Aug. 15.
Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, U.S.-China ties have collapsed, with the two countries clashing on multiple fronts including the spread of the virus, Hong Kong issues and technology.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. farmers impacted by the economic shutdown as the coronavirus hammered the global economy have more time to apply for aid from the federal government.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Tuesday it is extending the deadline to apply for direct payments through the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program to Sept. 11. 
The announcement came after an Aug. 7 letter from dozens of farm groups asking the agency to extend the deadline for farmers to apply.
""Many hard-working farm families have not gone through federal programs before and need help navigating their way through the process,"" said Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, in a statement reacting to the news. ""We encourage the USDA to expand its outreach efforts."" 
To ensure availability of funding, the USDA initially released only 80% of approved payments to farmers. But nine weeks into the program, less than half of the $16 billion allotted has been awarded. The agency said it will now pay out the nearly $1.8 billion it held back from initial payments.
The USDA also expanded the program to include 42 new crops and 15 new livestock or aquaculture classifications, including bananas, nectarines, microgreens, sheep, salmon, tilapia, nursery crops and cut flowers.

""CFAP is just one of the many ways USDA is helping producers weather the impacts of the pandemic. From deferring payments on loans to adding flexibilities to crop insurance and reporting deadlines, USDA has been leveraging many tools to help producers,"" Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said in a statement.

1237,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 04:55PM ET</span>",Brazil central bank grasps new tool in crisis fight: forward guidance,"By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank has adopted a new ""forward guidance"" strategy to keep interest rates and bond yields low, bring inflation up to target and stimulate the economy's fragile recovery from the COVID-19 crisis.
The move, outlined last week when the bank cut its benchmark Selic rate to a low of 2% and explained in meeting minutes on Tuesday, highlights a reluctance to cut rates further, and even more so to indulge in bond-buying quantitative easing.
Strictly speaking, it is not a brand new policy for the bank's rate-setting committee, known as Copom. The practice of reassuring markets that interest rates will not be raised for months or even years was briefly implemented under the presidency of Alexandre Tombini in late 2012 to early 2013, when the Selic was a then-low 7.25%.
Forward guidance is used more often by central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England in developed economies to sustain monetary stimulus when interest rates are zero or have hit the so-called ""effective lower bound."" 
It is less common in emerging markets, where economic, fiscal and financial market vulnerabilities are often greater. In Tuesday's minutes, Brazilian policymakers highlighted potential risks from further rate cuts to financial stability and asset markets and made no mention of QE.
Instead, forward guidance will be used to assure markets that the Selic rate will be kept low for a considerable period of time - and may yet be slightly lowered further - in the hope that market rates for the next few years will also stay low.
Alexandre Schwartsman, a former central bank director, said it is clear Copom is becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the Selic rate so low. 
""Therefore, in order to reconcile the need for additional stimulus with limitations on the use of the Selic rate, (Copom) decided to resort to forward guidance despite acknowledging the difficulties inherent to this additional instrument,"" he said, referring to the risks in terms of stability and market impact that the rate-setting committee itself mentioned.
Despite the challenges it faces, Copom said forward guidance was the strategy that offered ""the best cost-benefit ratio"" and would help keep borrowing costs on the ""intermediary part"" of the yield curve in check.
Copom said the policy will be asymmetric. That is, rates will not be raised, assuming certain conditions surrounding the outlook for inflation and the government's fiscal policy are met, but could still be cut.
""This forward guidance should be conditional on inflation expectations,"" Copom said, looking ahead to 2021 as well as 2022.
It will also be conditional on fiscal stability, ""since its rupture would imply significant changes to the structural interest rate of the economy,"" and on long-term inflation expectations remaining well-anchored, Copom added.
The initial reaction in financial markets, however, was perhaps not what Copom would have wanted.
January 2021 interest rate futures fell a couple of basis points to 1.86%, but implied rates on January 2023 contracts rose by more to 3.86%, steepening that part of the rates curve to its highest in two weeks.
Other parts of the curve going out a couple of years further hit the steepest since late June.
""The minutes bring a new approach for monetary policy – and a dangerous one,"" said a senior trader in Sao Paulo. 

""The main gauge of success for this strategy is both the shape of the curve and implied inflation,"" he said, noting that inflation may be tame but parts of the curve are steepening.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - A Trump administration official nominated to lead Latin America's main development bank on Tuesday dismissed the growing regional opposition to his candidacy, the first for anyone outside Latam, as ""subversive"" and led by a small minority.
Mauricio Claver-Carone, a White House heavyweight known for his hardline stance on Venezuela and Cuba, is the favorite to win the presidency at the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), which is set to hold a vote on the matter on Sept. 12.
Several countries, including Argentina, Mexico, Costa Rica and Chile, and European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, have called for a delay, citing concerns about having an IDB leader from outside the region.
In a call with reporters, Claver-Carone said 17 countries had given him public support.
""We are seeing a minority effort, led by the government of Argentina, to be able to obstruct the election because they have not been able to present or have not wanted to present a competitive vision,"" Claver-Carone said.
The ""minority, impeding, subversive effort"" would leave the bank in ""paralysis"" and scare off investment from the private sector in the region, he added.
""No one has helped more in the relationship between the United States and Mexico than me,"" Claver-Carone said.
Argentina's foreign ministry and Mexico's finance ministry declined to comment.
A battle has been brewing for control of the IDB, with U.S. President Donald Trump looking to combat the rising influence of China, and some countries chafing at losing control of the regional lender. Claver-Carone, Trump's fiery senior adviser on Latin America, has said he aims to raise the bank's capital and improve lending transparency.
A candidate needs the support of at least 15 of the 28 regional member countries and a majority of the total vote to win. The percentage of voting control relates to each country's shares in the bank and at least 75% must be present for a quorum or the election would be rescheduled.
Chile, Mexico, Argentina and Costa Rica combined represent just over 22% of the vote.
European countries could prove to be a tipping point. Some EU nations, including Spain, Italy and Germany, hold small percentages of voting power in the IDB. EU official Borrell has recommended the vote be rescheduled for 2021.
Borrell does not represent the position of any EU country, Claver-Carone said. ""The personal opinion of the foreign commissioner is a personal opinion, but it does not reflect any vote in the IDB.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - Young people who have lost jobs or schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic risk carrying ""scarring effects"" throughout their working lives unless governments provide immediate support, the International Labour Organization (ILO) said on Tuesday.
An ILO poll of 12,000 youths in 112 countries showed in May that more than one in six people under 24 had stopped working during the pandemic, while the U.N. agency said in its latest report that more than 70% of students had also seen closures of schools, universities and training centres. 
It urged governments to help reintegrate jobless youth into labour markets, or provide educational training and unemployment insurance benefits.
""The COVID-19 pandemic has a systematic, deep and disproportionate impact on young people,"" Sangheon Lee, director of ILO's employment policy department, told a news briefing.
Evidence from previous crises suggests young people who lack access to job opportunities when entering the labour market face ongoing consequences throughout their working lives, he said. ""That is what we call 'scarring effects'.""
Young women and youths in low-income countries are among the hardest hit, he said.
""Unless urgent action is taken, young people are likely to suffer severe and long-standing impacts from the pandemic. We believe there is a genuine risk of the 'lockdown generation' who actually will be scarred throughout their working lives,"" Lee said.
The pandemic has left 1 in 8 young students without any access to education or training, although those in wealthier countries had more access to online classes, Lee said.
""It's important to remember that risk is not just about the job losses,"" he said.
""Even for those who have remained employed after the onset of the pandemic, their working hours fell by nearly a quarter and two out of five young people reported a reduction in their incomes,"" he said.

Some 17% of young people reported suffering from anxiety and depression, nearly twice the rate as those still employed, Lee said. ""It is not surprising at all that their mental well-being suffered a lot,"" he said.

1240,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>","Trump's COVID orders too little, too late to help U.S. economy, experts say","By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's weekend attempt to sidestep stalled congressional negotiations over the next coronavirus aid package will do little to boost the economy, experts said.
Trump's executive order and presidential memoranda, introduced on Saturday, would temporarily extend enhanced unemployment benefits at a reduced amount of $400 a week, defer payroll taxes for some workers, suspend federal student loan payments and potentially provide eviction relief. Even if he can overcome the legal questions surrounding his actions, the efforts may not pack much punch, economists say. 
Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics, calculated the orders could provide just over $400 billion in total relief. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) economist Michael Feroli wrote in an email note on Monday that the initiatives could contribute ""less than $100 billion"" in stimulus. 
That's versus the $1 trillion aid package proposed by the Republican-led Senate or the more than $3 trillion aid bill passed by the Democrat-led House of Representatives. 
Altogether, the president's orders would add up to 0.2% of GDP, a ""negligible amount,"" according to estimates from Lydia Boussour, senior U.S. economist for Oxford Economics. 
Millions of jobless Americans could be financially squeezed this month after the expiration of a $600 weekly supplement to unemployment benefits, the winding down of eviction moratoriums across the country and the end of the Paycheck Protection Program, which supported small businesses.
Some of the measures proposed by Trump would take time to set up and could be challenged in court, experts said. ""They're not going to do anybody any good in the here and now,"" Zandi said in an interview. 
The president's efforts may also not reach all of the workers relying on aid. For example, the $400 weekly supplement to unemployment benefits would only apply to people receiving at least $100 in state unemployment benefits and could exclude some low-income workers. The added benefits, which would be financed by $44 billion from the Disaster Relief Fund, would only last about five or six weeks, Feroli estimates. 
And the program would put more pressure on states - which have already seen their budgets strained during the crisis - by requiring them to pay 25% of the $400 supplement.
A measure that would defer employees' share of the Social Security payroll tax from September through December is not expected to have a noticeable impact on spending because it helps people who are still working, wrote Boussour. Workers would still owe the taxes later.
Trump's policy move on housing may not lead to immediate relief for people who are falling behind on their rent or mortgage payments. 
The president asked the heads of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Treasury to look into ways to provide assistance to renters and homeowners and to research legal actions that could help to avoid evictions and foreclosures - rather than spelling out any concrete actions. 
The measure that is most likely to become reality is the extension of a freeze on federal student loan payments, Zandi said. That is set to expire Sept. 30; Trump's measure would extend it through the end of the year. 

The step could save borrowers $15 billion to $20 billion, Zandi estimates. ""For the students that's a big deal, but for the macro economy in a crisis, it's really not meaningful.""

“We thought the economy faced a pothole and stimulus put a plate over it so we could navigate,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin told a webinar hosted by the Center for Regional Economic Competitiveness Tuesday. “Now escalation of the virus may make the pothole into a sinkhole and that would create the need for a longer plate. If Congress takes away support too abruptly, you know what could happen to my metaphorical automobile.”
The Federal Open Market Committee left interest rates near zero in July, having cut them in March in response to the virus-induced recession, and pledged to use all its tools to support the recovery. Officials have also repeatedly said that additional fiscal support will be needed.
U.S. lawmakers, who authorized some $3 trillion in fiscal aid in the early months of the crisis, are still haggling over fresh support even after some of that assistance has expired. President Donald Trump moved to implement executive orders over the weekend to at least partially extend expired unemployment aid and defer payroll taxes.
U.S. unemployment declined 10.2% in July from 11.1% the month before as the economy slowly began to reopen and employers brought staff back to work. But the jobless level remains above the peak of the 2007-2009 recession and Barkin warned that Covid-19 flare-ups around the country were hitting the rebound.
Flattening Momentum
“The resurgence in the virus in the last few weeks has clearly flattened out momentum,” Barkin said. “The path of the economy still depends on the course of the virus. It obviously hasn’t been deterred by warmer weather, unfortunately.”
Barkin said the outlook could be become clearer over the next few weeks depending on the virus and the amount of fiscal support. “Escalation could be a significant jolt to confidence,” he said. “The path forward also depends on the evolution of stimulus. The fiscal side is unclear as you know.”
Lower-paid services employees quickly spent money that was provided in the initial package, while white-collar workers increased savings, Barkin said. The aid offset some of the blow to economic growth in the past few months, he said. State and local governments would be forced to make cutbacks without additional fiscal support, he said.

The trade group said that just 7% of respondents to its annual membership survey said that the benefits from the Phase 1 agreement outweigh the costs of tariffs incurred along the way. Some 36% of respondents said the costs outweighed the benefits and 56% said it was too soon to tell.
But the USCBC said 88% of respondents held a ""positive"" or somewhat positive overall view of the trade deal. Half of those responding positively said this was because the deal ""makes the bilateral relationship more stable and decreases chances for further tariff escalation.""
The Phase 1 trade deal, activated on Feb. 15, calls for China to increase purchases of U.S. farm and manufactured products, energy and services by $200 billion over two years, along with increased U.S. access to China's financial services markets, and some improvements in intellectual property protections. Promised negotiations on a Phase 2 agreement covering more difficult technology transfer issues, industrial subsidies and data restrictions have been shelved.
China is far behind the pace of purchases needed to meet its first-year purchase increase target of $77 billion. 
Despite this shortfall and a rapidly deteriorating U.S.-China relationship amid issues from China's security crackdown on Hong Kong to Trump's threat to shut down Chinese-owned short video app TikTok, White House adviser Larry Kudlow said on Tuesday the Phase 1 trade deal is ""fine right now."" 
Top U.S. and Chinese officials are due to hold a videoconference on Saturday to assess the six-month implementation of the Phase 1 agreement.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's Top Glove Corp (KL:TPGC) is working rapidly to resolve this month issues that prompted a U.S. Customs import ban, including improving its migrant workers' living conditions, its managing director said on Tuesday.
In engagements with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) last week, the world's largest medical glove maker said the standard of workers' accommodation was one of two issues highlighted.
CBP placed a detention order on imports from two subsidiaries of Top Glove last month, an action the authority takes on firms suspected of using forced labour.
""They wanted us to take care of the living quarters of the foreign workers,"" Managing Director Lee Kim Meow told Reuters.
He said repair and upgrade work was taking place at accommodation the CBP had singled out and other migrant workers' housing would be improved as required.
Lee said the company was also seeking to integrate technology to enable workers to raise issues affecting their living conditions as problems with workers' quarters far from the head office had been overlooked.
The other issue CBP identified is referred to as remediation, or paying back workers fees they paid to employment agents to get their jobs.
Top Glove made its first remediation payment to migrant workers who joined before 2019 on Monday.
Lee said Top Glove will pay the estimated total of 53 million ringgit ($12.65 million) in remediation, covering around 10,000 foreign workers from Bangladesh, Nepal, Indonesia, Myanmar and Cambodia, over 12 months.
Top Glove hires about 12,000 foreign workers in total.
Prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Top Glove has started producing face masks and also plans to manufacture medical gowns and cleaning products, such as sanitisers and washing liquids. It hopes to gain approvals to export its masks in two months, and start making medical gowns next year.

1246,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>","Small Firms Die Quietly, Leaving Thousands of Failures Uncounted","(Bloomberg) -- Big companies are going bankrupt at a record pace, but that’s only part of the carnage. By some accounts, small businesses are disappearing by the thousands amid the Covid-19 pandemic, and the drag on the economy from these failures could be huge.
This wave of silent failures goes uncounted in part because real-time data on small business is notoriously scarce, and because owners of small firms often have no debt, and thus no need for bankruptcy court.
“Probably all you need to do is call the utilities and tell them to turn them off and close your door,” said William Dunkelberg, who runs a monthly survey as chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business. Nevertheless, closures “are going to be well above normal because we’re in a disastrous economic situation,” Dunkelberg said.
 Yelp  (NYSE:YELP) Inc., the online reviewer, has data showing more than 80,000 permanently shuttered from March 1 to July 25. About 60,000 were local businesses, or firms with fewer than five locations. About 800 small businesses did indeed file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy from mid-February to July 31, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute, and the trade group expects the 2020 total could be up 36% from last year.
While the busineses are small individually, the collective impact of their failures could be substantial. Firms with fewer than 500 employees account for about 44% of U.S. economic activity, according to a U.S. Small Business Administration report, and they employ almost half of all American workers.
Justine Bacon permanently shut her Yoga Brain studio in Philadelphia after deciding it was too dangerous to hold indoor classes because of the pandemic. Bacon didn’t file for bankruptcy, she just simply closed up shop and went out of business on June 30.
“I felt it better to close with some money in the account and not have to worry about bankrupting the business,” said Bacon, 35.While large companies are seeking court protection at a record pace, countless small businesses like Yoga Brain aren’t included in the official toll.
No Help
Chapter 11 bankruptcy gives a business protection from its creditors while the owners work out a turnaround plan. For smaller companies, though, the extra time might not make any difference. “Bankruptcy cannot create more revenue,” said Robert Keach, a restructuring partner at New England-based Bernstein Shur and former president at the American Bankruptcy Institute.
Some owners fear bankruptcy could scar their credit reports and hurt their future chances to rebuild. Bankrupt businesses have a nearly 24 percentage point higher likelihood of being denied a loan, according to the SBA, and a filing can show up on a credit report for 10 years.
That’s one of Rebecca Schner’s concerns. Things were looking up for Schner, 51, and her jewelry and fair trade shop New Lotus Moon in The Woodlands, Texas. She opened in 2018 and finally started to break even at the start of this year.
Then the virus hit. After the store closed to walk-in customers, she said sales dropped and she couldn’t cover rent. She emptied the shop around mid-May, moved her jewelry cases into storage, and dismissed her part-time employee. She’s making minimum payments on nearly $50,000 in loans.
“What if I want to have a mobile boutique and go buy a vehicle for that? Would I be able to get a loan?” Schner said.
Lost Revenue
To be sure, small business attrition is high even in normal times. Only about half of all establishments survive for at least five years, according to the SBA. But the swiftness of the pandemic and the huge drop in economic activity is hitting hard among typically upbeat entrepreneurs. About 58% of small business owners say they’re worried about permanently closing, according to a July U.S. Chamber of Commerce survey.
In a June 2020 NFIB survey, a net 31% of owners reported lower sales in the past three months, while 7% reported higher sales a year earlier. In the same survey, only 13% of business owners said it was a good time to expand, a dip from 24% a year earlier.
Jose Gamiz, 45, and Leticia Gamiz, 52, closed their restaurant in Glendale, Arizona on July 31. The bills started piling up, and while thousands in government loans helped, they weren’t taking in enough cash. They had four part-time employees.
It was too much of a gamble to keep Mi Vegana Madre open, Jose Gamiz said. The couple knew the dangers of taking risks after they lost the first house they bought during the 2008 crisis.
“We wanted to take that as a lesson,” Jose Gamiz said. “Sometimes it’s okay to let it go and not expend every penny.”

Tesla (O:TSLA) in June said its new Model S Long Range Plus is the first vehicle certified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to have an estimated driving range of more than 400 miles.
The Lucid Air will be followed by an SUV, built in early 2023 on the same vehicle platform, said Rawlinson, who is the former chief engineer on the Model S, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.
Lucid is based in Newark, California, on the southeastern side of Silicon Valley, not far from Tesla's Fremont factory.
Lucid was founded in 2007 as Atieva Inc by former Tesla executive Bernard Tse and entrepreneur Sam Weng.
It was funded initially by Chinese and Silicon Valley venture investors, with additional funding from state-owned Chinese auto maker BAIC Motor (HK:1958) and LeEco, a Chinese technology company controlled by the founder of another electric vehicle startup, Faraday Future, according to investor website PitchBook.
To help fund construction of a U.S. assembly plant in Casa Grande, Arizona, Lucid was boosted by a $1 billion investment in September 2018 by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.
The plant initially will have an annual capacity of 34,000 vehicles, building toward 360,000 about seven years later, Rawlinson said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - After reaching a $65 billion restructuring agreement in principle with its creditors earlier this month, Argentina must now turn to relief from the International Monetary Fund to free up cash in the near term, the IIF said on Tuesday.
""We think external financing will be comfortable if the IMF rolls over its exposure,"" the Institute of International Finance said in a note.
The agreement with creditors gives Argentina much-needed breathing space. 
Cash flows into and out of the country have ground to a halt, partly due to capital controls and the non-payment of obligations during the debt negotiations.
""As long as capital controls remain in place, resident capital flight will not be a source of pressure,"" said the IIF note. 
Payments to the IMF could quickly become unsustainable under the current schedule.
The large payments due to the IMF stem from having received the largest-ever program from the Fund in 2018. 
Beyond that new agreement expected with the IMF, investors are focused on Argentina's medium-term economic plan, according to Sergi Lanau, deputy chief economist at the IIF. 
Prudent fiscal policy has been hard to come by for Argentina, Lanau said, adding that the government has done ""a lot"" on the tax side and now it is ""more likely that it's unavoidable to look for savings on the spending side.
""That's always politically and socially complicated, but it needs to be done.""

1249,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>","Hyundai, Aptiv name self-driving joint venture Motional","By Paul Lienert
(Reuters) - South Korean automaker  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) and auto supplier Aptiv PLC (N:APTV) have named their self-driving joint venture Motional, the companies said Tuesday.
Formed a year ago, the $4-billion venture is developing a fully automated system that it hopes to begin selling in 2022 to robotaxi companies and fleet operators, Chief Executive Karl Iagnemma said in an interview.
“In a post-COVID world, driverless technology is more relevant and important than ever,” he said. “More Americans are interested in ride hailing now than before the pandemic.”
Boston-based Motional, which expects to have more than 1,000 employees by year-end, has locations in Pittsburgh, Las Vegas, Santa Monica, Singapore and now Seoul.
Its chief competitors include Waymo, the Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) affiliate; Cruise, the San Francisco startup that’s majority-owned by General Motors Co (N:GM), and Pittsburgh-based Argo AI, which is jointly controlled by  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p).
Waymo’s self-driving technology was developed in-house at Google, and the company has attracted funding from Canadian auto supplier Magna International (TO:MG) and dealer AutoNation (N:AN). It is testing its system in robotaxis and commercial vehicles, with  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) and  United Parcel  Service (N:UPS), among others.
Cruise, whose shareholders include Honda Motor Co (T:7267) and SoftBank Group (T:9984), has been testing both ride and delivery services, and eventually will deploy an electric shuttle jointly developed by GM and Honda.
Argo has been testing its system in Ford vehicles at several U.S. locations, with plans to expand to Europe with VW.
Iagnemma said those three self-driving ventures — and Motional — may have the best changes of survival.

“Unless you check all three boxes” — software, capital and a strategic partnership with a vehicle manufacturer — “your chances of succeeding at scale are slim,” he said. “If you don’t have resources to get to scale, ultimately you’ll end up with a novelty.”

1250,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>",Trump Says He’s ‘Seriously’ Mulling a Capital Gains Tax Cut,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he’s “very seriously” considering a capital gains tax cut, a move he decided against last September after saying it wouldn’t do enough to help the middle class.
“We’re looking at also considering a capital gains tax cut, which would create a lot more jobs,” Trump said Monday at a White House news conference.
The president can’t unilaterally cut the 20% long-term capital gains rate without Congress, but some advisers tell him he could issue an executive order that would slash tax bills for investors when they sell assets. The move, known as indexing capital gains to inflation, adjusts the original purchase price of an asset when it is sold so no tax is paid on appreciation tied to inflation.
Revamping capital gains taxes through a rule or executive order likely would face legal challenges, a concern that reportedly prompted former President George H.W. Bush’s administration to drop a similar plan.

Trump, facing an impasse on Capitol Hill over coronavirus relief, has recently tapped his presidential authority to bypass Congress. Trump issued an executive directive on Saturday that would delay the deadline to submit payroll taxes for millions of workers until the end of the year. He said he hopes Congress will forgive those tax debts, but absent legislation, those payments will still be required by the extended due date.
Trump had previously considered indexing capital gains to inflation after being urged to do so by some conservatives including Senator Ted Cruz and Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist, but ruled out the idea last year saying “it’s not something I love.”
Most of the benefits would go to high-income households, with the top 1% receiving 86% of the benefit, according to estimates in 2018 by the Penn Wharton Budget Model. The policy could reduce tax revenue by $102 billion over a decade, the model found.
Trump also said he was considering a “cut in the middle-income income tax.” Congress would have to pass legislation to make any reductions to tax rates, which is unlikely to happen before the end of the year.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday that he’s spoken with “several Democrats,” but not House Speaker Nancy Pelosi or Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer since their last negotiating session ended Friday without any breakthrough.

1252,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 06:33AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Tuesday, August 11th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The S&P is set to test an all-time high as the coronavirus starts to retreat and President Trump talks up tax cut plans. Talks on the next round of economic relief measures are still deadlocked. A German leading indicator hits its highest level in 16 years, but the U.K. labor market weakens sharply. Oil prices rise ahead of the first of three big updates this week. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, August 11th.
1. Virus recedes
The number of new infections of Covid-19 in the U.S. stayed under 50,000 for a second straight day, strengthening hopes that the virus is coming back under control.
The number of hospitalizations also fell in California, New York and Texas, although they continued at a high rate in Florida.
The curve of new infections has clearly flattened since states across the south and west started to tighten restrictions on indoor meetings and on the wearing of face masks. The question is now whether it can stay subdued as schools across the country prepare to reopen, potentially creating a powerful vector for community spread.
Further afield, Russia – which has been accused of trying to steal intellectual property from U.S. and European pharma companies researching Covid-19 treatments – conditionally approved its first vaccine for the virus.
The worldwide number of confirmed cases topped 20 million, due not least to fast-rising case numbers in India.
2. Stimulus talks still deadlocked as Trump grandstands with CGT cut
The next round of economic relief measures for the U.S. economy remains deadlocked, although both the Trump Administration and House Democrats claimed they were ready to talk again.
Late on Monday, President Donald Trump said he’s “seriously considering” a cut in capital gains tax, a statement that has supported risk assets overnight despite the obvious difficulty in enacting it in the current circumstances.
Trump has benefited politically from his handling of the recent standoff and, it would seem, from the easing of the health crisis in the south and west, according to some political trackers. Spread betting firm Predictit now gives Trump a 45% chance of winning the election in November, the highest it’s been since early June.
3. S&P 500 nears all-time high
U.S. stock markets are set to open higher, supported by the improving news from the virus front and by Trump’s musing on tax cuts.
The S&P 500 is set to test an all-time high later, with the index’s futures contract trading up 0.7% at 3,376, less than 1% below February’s peak.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow 30 Futures contract was up 272 points or 1.0%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.5%
Stocks in focus are likely to include IAC/InterActiveCorp (NASDAQ:IAC), the owner of Tinder and other dating sites, which reported disappointing results after the bell on Monday, and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), which reported an $8.4 billion loss with heavy writedowns and a big cut to its production forecast.
Also of interest will be Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), which were ordered by a California court on Monday to treat their drivers as employees, a ruling that will sharply raise their operating costs if not overturned on appeal.
4. German sentiment improves
European stocks were also sharply higher overnight, despite a mixed bag of economic data that showed the extent of the troubles facing the economy.
The closely-watched German ZEW economic sentiment index rose to a 16-year high as expectations of a recovery became ever more firmly entrenched. However, the index of current conditions worsened, instead of improving as expected.
In the U.K., meanwhile, employment fell at the sharpest rate since 2009, with 220,000 jobs being lost in the three months through May. The more up-to-date figure of those claiming jobless benefits rose by 94,400 in July and is set to continue rising through year-end as the government winds back its wage subsidy scheme.

Casino executives and investors have been eagerly awaiting the announcement as a catalyst to reviving gaming revenue, which has slumped since February due to coronavirus travel restrictions.
China's National Immigration Administration said, provided the domestic coronavirus situation continued to improve, residents would be able to apply for individual and group travel visas to enter the special administrative region located on the country's southern coast.
Visitors from greater China make up over 90% of tourists to the former Portuguese colony of Macau.
Shares of Hong Kong listed casino stocks soared on Tuesday following the announcement.
Residents from the neighbouring coastal province of Guangdong on the mainland will be able to apply from Aug. 26, the National Immigration Administration said. Residents from Zhuhai city across the border from Macau are permitted from Aug. 12.

The announcement comes nearly a month after China loosened coronavirus-related border restrictions between Macau and Guangdong.

(Reuters) - Goods made in Hong Kong for export to the United States will need to be labelled as made in China after Sept. 25, according to a U.S. government notice posted on Tuesday.
The move follows China's imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong and a U.S. decision to end the former British colony's special status under U.S. law, escalating bilateral tensions that were already rising over trade war tariffs and the handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
The latest step will see Hong Kong companies subject to the same trade war tariffs levied on mainland Chinese exporters, should they make products subject to these duties, said the U.S. Customs and Border Protection notice.
It said that 45 days after its publication, goods ""must be marked to indicate that their origin is 'China'"". 
The step was taken after the United States determined that Hong Kong is ""no longer sufficiently autonomous to justify differential treatment in relation to China"".
Trump has made tough talk against China a feature of his campaign for re-election in November.
The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the city's current and former police chiefs accused of curtailing political freedoms in the former British colony. 
In retaliation, China imposed sanctions on 11 U.S. citizens including lawmakers from Trump's Republican Party on Monday.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that companies from China and other countries that do not comply with U.S. accounting standards will be delisted from U.S. stock exchanges from the end of 2021.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea will take the smallest hit to growth of any advanced economy this year after it was able to limit the spread of the coronavirus without imposing severe lockdowns, the OECD said on Tuesday.
South Korea's gross domestic product will fall just 0.8% in 2020, a slight improvement from the 1.2% downturn in GDP forecast in June, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said in a report on Asia's fourth biggest economy.
That is considerably milder than the OECD average of a 7.5% contraction for this year, and far outperforms the 7.3% and 6.0% shrinkage seen for major economies the United States and Japan, respectively.
""South Korea is seen as an example in the OECD, not only with its (virus) containment strategies but also with its focus on investing in future growth engines for the economy,"" said Ko Hyoung-kwon, South Korea's ambassador to the OECD.
Private consumption is expected to slowly pick up as the government eases its guidelines on social distancing, although a protracted global recession is set to drag down exports and investment, the OECD said in its report.
It recommended the Bank of Korea to consider further monetary policy easing if low inflation and sluggish activity persist, and also urged the bank to look at more unconventional policies given it has little space left for more rate cuts.
The BOK has slashed its policy interest rate by 75 basis points since March to 0.5% , working in tandem with a 277 trillion won ($231 billion) stimulus package rolled out by the government to fight the economic fallout from the pandemic.
South Korea emerged as an early success story in containing the virus among its 51 million people after a severe outbreak in Daegu in March, basing its approach on vigorous testing and tracing strategies. 
It is still battling small but persistent clusters of infections, having reported 14,660 cases and 305 deaths.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's retail inflation edged up slightly in July due to higher food prices, remaining firmly above the RBI's medium-term target of 4% for a 10th straight month, a Reuters poll showed.
Food prices, which account for nearly half the inflation basket, have soared since April due to supply-side disruptions caused by a nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus which has infected more than 2 million people and killed over 44,000 in the world's second-most populous country.
While the central government gradually eased restrictions in June, regional lockdowns in some major agricultural producing states continued to disrupt supplies of essential perishables like fruits and vegetables.
The August 6-10 Reuters poll of over 45 economists showed Indian retail inflation rose to 6.15% last month from 6.09% in June. 
Forecasts for the data, scheduled to be released on Aug 12 at 1200 GMT, ranged from 5.00% to 6.55%.
""We see July CPI inflation to be steady above the Reserve Bank of India's 6% policy limit. Food remained a dominant inflation driver but high utility and transport costs also contributed,"" said Prakash Sakpal, Asia economist at ING.
The government suspended the release of CPI inflation headline numbers for April and May due to insufficient data during the lockdown.
The RBI kept interest rates on hold last week after reducing the repo rate by a total of 115 basis points since February - despite a recent rise in retail consumer prices - but said it would ensure inflation remains within target.
According to the RBI's latest survey, household inflation expectations for the three-month and one-year horizons rose to over 10% in July, suggesting Asia's third-largest economy could enter a period of stagflation - a phase with lofty inflation, high unemployment and stagnant demand.
""With inflation expected to remain elevated on supply side disruptions, we think a rate cut is more probable in December,"" said Rini Sen, India economist at ANZ.
""We expect food prices to abate likely from September onwards, once the rabi crop (summer harvest) enters the market.""

Monsoon rains, which are critical for farm output and economic growth, are expected to be 104% of a long-term average in August and September, indicating bumper harvests and helping to alleviate the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's auto sales in July climbed 16.4% from a year earlier, the fourth consecutive month of gains as the world's biggest vehicle market comes off lows hit during the country's coronavirus lockdown.
Sales rose to 2.11 million vehicles in July but are still down 12.7% for the year to date at 12.37 million vehicles, according to wholesale sales data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM).
The association expects auto sales to fall around 10% this year barring a second wave of virus infections which could deepen the slide to around 20%.
In a promising sign for many global automakers which have invested heavily in electric vehicles for the China market, sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) ended 12 straight months of decline with a 19.3% jump to 98,000 units.
""The sales growth shows NEV makers and customers are getting used to the new normal after the government cut subsidies last year,"" said Xu Haidong, a senior CAAM official.
CAAM expects NEV sales of 1.1 million vehicles this year, a drop of around 11% from last year.
NEVs include battery-powered electric, plug-in gasoline-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.
Sales of trucks and other commercial vehicles, which constitute around a quarter of the market, surged 59.4%, driven by government investment in infrastructure as well as tougher emission rules introduced this year. Sales of passenger vehicles rose 8.5%.
Automakers which have reported sales growth in July include Great Wall Motor Co Ltd (SS:601633), Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203).
Haitong International analyst Shi Ji said that current levels of inventory in the industry seemed high, which could prompt dealers to offer bigger discounts.

Traders are washing out Brazilian purchases made earlier in the year as the price gap to American supplies widened, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Some traders have struck the arrangements to supply their own operations in China, while others are doing them on behalf of Chinese clients, the people said.
Brazilian soybean prices have surged as supplies dried up. At the same time, the American harvest is just around the corner and traders are expecting a bumper crop. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast yields will be the highest since 2016 when the U.S. Department of Agriculture releases its closely-watched monthly report on Wednesday.
The price gap between the two countries has boosted American purchases. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Monday reported almost 600,000 metric tons of soybeans sold to China in trades that took place at the end of last week. On Monday, people familiar with the matter said American shippers sold at least another six cargoes to China. A typical cargo holds 55,000 to 60,000 tons.
The move could help China accelerate progress toward meeting its pledges under the phase-one trade deal with the U.S. ahead of an Aug. 15 meeting between Washington and Beijing. In the first half of the year, the U.S. shipped about $7.3 billion in agricultural goods to China, only 20% of the $36.5 billion goal, USDA data showed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican and Democratic governors said on Monday President Donald Trump's coronavirus relief measures were too expensive for states to implement as they struggle with the costs of the pandemic, and called on officials in Washington to resume negotiations on federal aid.
""We are concerned about the significant administrative burdens and costs this latest action would place on the states,"" the leaders of the National Governors Association said in a statement.
""The best way forward is for the Congress and the Administration to get back to the negotiating table and come up with a workable solution, which should provide meaningful additional relief for American families,"" New York's Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, and Arkansas' Republican governor, Asa Hutchinson, said.
Talks on a new coronavirus relief package between top Trump administration officials and congressional Democratic leaders collapsed on Friday without an agreement and the two sides have not been in touch since. The Democratic-led House of Representatives passed a $3.4 trillion aid bill in May.
In a bid to move ahead without Congress, the Republican president on Saturday signed executive orders and a memorandum seeking to provide relief to workers, businesses and local governments.
Eviction protections and enhanced unemployment assistance both expired in July, slashing aid for more than 30 million people. 
Trump's orders addressed payroll taxes, evictions and student loan payments, and included a plan to provide supplemental unemployment benefits using disaster relief funds. States would be required to cover 25% of the unemployment funding under the plan.It was not immediately clear that Trump's orders would have any significant impact on the crisis, however. 
U.S. states have seen sharp declines in taxes and other revenues and steep demands for services from residents during the crisis. 
California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said Trump's plan would cost his state $700 million per week, which it could not provide without cutting other important services.
PARTISAN POLITICS
Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who did not join the negotiations, accused Democrats of stalling aid to secure objectives like $1 trillion for state and local governments, which he dismissed as a bailout for ""mismanaged"" Democratic-led states.
The Senate unveiled its $1 trillion package late last month, around when administration officials began negotiating with the Democrats. 
""(Democrats are) willing to personally increase the pain for vulnerable families unless they get their way,"" McConnell said as the Senate opened on Monday.
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, who has led negotiations alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said Democrats would talk if Republicans would compromise.
""Democrats remain ready to return to the table. We need Republicans to join us there and meet us halfway,"" he said.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has represented the White House in the talks, said he had not spoken to Pelosi or Schumer since Friday but was willing to meet.
""We're prepared to put more money on the table,"" he told reporters at the White House. He insisted most states would be able to execute Trump's unemployment order within a week or two.
There are areas of agreement between Democrats and Republicans, including providing money for schools and coronavirus testing. But they remain at odds over major issues like the level of unemployment benefits and liability protections for businesses.

The expired federal benefit was $600 per week on top of state unemployment payments. Trump proposed $400.

""This recession is unique in its swiftness severity and scope,"" Evans said in opening remarks for an online forum organized by the Chicago Fed.
""Tragically, the most affected are our most vulnerable neighbors - those who don't enjoy paid sick leave, can't work from home or don't have much cushion in their savings accounts. Their future is highly uncertain and will require new policies to help them through this difficult transition.""
Evans said that reports of businesses that rushed to reopen without enough safety measures are contributing to a resurgence in infections and hurting the economy by delaying the “return to normal.” Policymakers from the local level to the federal level need to work together to lead to lasting progress, he said. 
However, even after the virus subsides, some businesses will have shut down permanently and some unemployed Americans will need assistance with finding find new jobs. Economic policies also need to be targeted to help the workers in racial groups that were struggling before the downturn, Evans said.

“Even when the economy was stronger, systemic racism and other barriers limited opportunities for too many people,” he said. “Simply returning to where we were in February is not enough to meet this generation’s challenge.”

1267,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 02:54PM ET</span>",Food Bank Already Under Strain From End of Higher Unemployment Aid,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s executive action may have kept higher U.S. unemployment benefits in place for now, but potential payment delays and a cap on the funds could still leave low-income Americans in the lurch.
Trump sought to bypass a deadlocked Congress by ordering payments of $400 a week, a reduction from the $600 federal top-up that was approved in March and ran out at the end of July. The extra money has helped millions of U.S. households get through the pandemic amid a record wave of layoffs.
While it’s still too early for economic data to capture what happened when the payments stopped last week, Claudia Raymer -- who oversees a network of food-security groups in Ohio County, West Virginia -- saw an immediate impact.
On Wednesday, a soup kitchen that she helps organize served almost 400 meals, the most since April. The following day, a separate summer program that distributes food via a local school ran out of boxes to give away, for the first time in weeks.
“We’ve definitely already seen food-security needs increase, just in a week, since the extra unemployment has ended,’’ Raymer said.
The resumption of payments under Trump’s executive order, which diverts emergency funds into the benefit program, should alleviate some of the strain.
But the president’s move faces a potential legal challenge. Economists also warn that it may take time to get a rejigged system up and running.
“Before you even get into these questions around the legality of what the president is promoting, just practically, it’s not something that’s going to be a solution quickly for millions of people,” said Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at online loan marketplace LendingTree.
The Treasury was disbursing money to state unemployment systems at a pace of about $100 billion a month between May and July. Payouts in the first week of August were on track to be the lowest since April.
That means there’s also a risk that the $44 billion emergency fund that Trump proposes to draw on could run out relatively fast.“It’s a very complex crisis with a lot of moving parts, and there just hasn’t really been a good, comprehensive solution as of yet,” Kapfidze said.

A delay in voting would be a potential setback for U.S. President Donald Trump's pick to lead the institution.
The U.S. candidate, Mauricio Claver-Carone, a Trump adviser known for his hard-line stance on Venezuela and Cuba, is the current favorite to win the top spot at the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), which is set to hold a vote on the matter next month.
""This postponement is necessary because something as vital to us as the new IDB president cannot come out of a virtual meeting,"" said Argentine Foreign Minister Felipe Sola in an interview with Radio con Vos in Buenos Aires.
Claver-Carone would become the first person from outside Latin America to lead the Washington-based bank, a smaller cousin of the International Monetary Fund that has been led by Latin Americans since its founding in 1959.
Mexico's finance ministry said last week that the vote should be postponed ""until the conditions were right,"" echoing a similar call on Thursday from Chile. Also last week Costa Rica's foreign ministry said in a statement that delaying the election would be ""a timely and convenient option"".
Regional heavyweight Brazil has however backed Claver-Carone's candidacy, along with Colombia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve announced on Monday how much each large bank that underwent its 2020 stress tests will have to hold in additional capital.
The results mark the first time the Fed has given out custom capital requirements for each bank under its new ""stress capital buffer,"" and takes effect on Oct. 1. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were ordered to hold the most capital of the 34 firms tested, with ratios of 13.7% and 13.4% respectively.
The custom capital requirements follow stress test results released in June, which found that banks would weather heavy capital losses should the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic drag on or worsen. The Fed ordered banks to cap dividend payments and bar share repurchases until at least the fourth quarter to ensure they have sufficient cushions.
The new capital ratio combines the minimum capital requirements of 4.5% and the new ""stress capital buffer,"" which is determined by how each bank fared under a hypothetical severe economic downturn. That buffer is at least 2.5%, but was highest for  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s U.S. operations at 7.8%.
The nation's largest banks also face an additional capital surcharge for their predominant role in the financial system, ranging from 1% to 3.5% for JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the nation's biggest bank.

The Fed also announced that it had reaffirmed the stress test results for five banks that requested reconsideration: BMO Financial Corp [BMOHF.UL],  Capital One  Financial Corp (NYSE:COF), Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) Group Inc, Goldman Sachs and Regions Financial Corp (NYSE:RF). The Fed said the additional review found its stress test models worked as intended and there were no errors.

The head of Norges Bank’s Supervisory Council told key lawmakers gathered for a rare parliamentary hearing that risks remain for conflicts of interest and that rules were broken when hedge-fund manager Nicolai Tangen was hired to head the fund. Tangen is due to start his new job on Sept. 1.
The watchdog “doesn’t share the view” of Norges Bank that possible conflicts of interest between the wealth fund, Tangen’s firm AKO Capital LLP and his personal assets have “for all practical purposes been eliminated,” Julie Brodtkorb, the head of the Supervisory Council, said in the webcast hearing on Monday.
The central bank, which manages the fund, has broken both ethical principles and transparency laws in the appointment process, and may also have breached the central-bank act in providing insufficient information to the Finance Ministry, she added.
Controversial Appointment
Tangen’s appointment come under fire almost from its announcement in March. The watchdog, some policy makers and other observers have criticized different parts of the hiring process, with most of the debate focusing on how Tangen would create Chinese walls between his wealth, estimated at about 700 million pounds ($900 million), AKO (where he will remain the biggest owner) and his new job.
Norges Bank governor Oystein Olsen repeated in comments to the parliament’s Finance Committee on Monday that the risk of conflicts had been all but eliminated, although he conceded there had been “learning points along the way.”
After the hearing, the committee may decide to ask the Finance Ministry to take some form of action, though the threshold for challenging the central bank’s prerogative to hire the wealth fund CEO appears to be high. The Conservative-led minority government has so far been careful not to get drawn into the debate, and its ally in parliament, Progress, has already made clear it’s satisfied with the terms of Tangen’s contract.
The opposition Labor Party, the parliament’s biggest group, has yet to decide on whether it will push for the committee to get the government involved, its deputy leader Hadia Tajik said by phone before the hearing.
The Supervisory Council, whose members are appointed by parliament, doesn’t have the power to overrule the central bank’s decisions.

Macau's Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture Ao Ieong U announced that the highly anticipated individual visit scheme (IVS) would resume from Aug. 12.
Casinos in the world's biggest gambling hub have experienced heavy losses since February when travel dried up due to the coronavirus. Greater China accounts for more than 90% of Macau's tourists.
Executives have said that without a resumption of the IVS scheme there will not be much hope for casino operators.
The announcement comes nearly a month after China loosened coronavirus-related border restrictions between Macau and the neighboring coastal province of Guangdong.
The direct impact on gaming revenue from the Zhuhai IVS restart is likely to be limited, said Vitaly Umansky, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong.

""However, the restart of IVS and group visa issuance (which has been suspended since late January) is another baby step in the right direction as China and Macau slowly loosen travel between the two jurisdictions.""

Investing.com -- China cracks down in Hong Kong and sanctions U.S. officials. President Trump signs four executive orders to try to bridge the gap left by lawmakers on extending unemployment benefits. German firms see disruptions to public life lasting another 9 months, and crude oil bounces as  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) gives an upbeat outlook. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, August 10th.
1. China cracks down in Hong Kong, sanctions U.S. pols
China arrested Jimmy Lai, one of Hong Kong’s richest and best-known publishers, on suspicion of collusion with foreign agents, in a stark illustration of the new realities of power in the former U.K. colony since the introduction of a new security law earlier in the summer.
Shares in Lai’s company  Next Digital Ltd  (HK:0282), which had already collapsed in anticipation of government action against him, more than quadrupled on the news.
Beijing also said it will sanction 11 U.S. politicians, including Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, in response to U.S. sanctions announced on the same number of Chinese officials last week.
The U.S. sanctions are likely to be followed in the next month or two by a list from the Treasury identifying all the entities currently in breach of them, a list that Autonomous Research says may well include China’s state commercial banks and policy banks.
2. Trump tries to bridge the gap
President Donald Trump issued four executive orders to partially extend the payment of enhanced unemployment benefits, in order to bridge a gap left by the failure of Congressional Republicans and Democrats to agree on a new package of economic relief measures.
However, uncertainties over the legality of the orders mean that their impact both on the lives of ordinary Americans and on the psychology of the market may be limited, analysts warned.
Trump’s orders would extend the weekly checks sent to households under the CARES act, but cut the amount to $400 from $600. In addition, Trump wants states to foot one-quarter of that bill.   
“We still expect a package worth at least $1.5 trillion to become law by the end of August, but the risk of no further legislative action has increased and could pose a threat to the budding recovery,” Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts led by Jan Hatzius said at the weekend.
3. Stocks set to open mixed amid stimulus bill guesses
U.S. stock markets are set to open mixed as the market tries to guess where the stimulus package goes from here.  The dollar, meanwhile, bounced after heavy losses.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 104 points or 0.2%, while the US 500 Futures contract was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down less than 0.1%, retracing a little after another week of outperformance.
Earnings season continues with updates from Barrick Gold, Duke Energy, Tencent Music Entertainment, Marriott, WorldPay, Liberty Media Sirius and two canaries in the coronavirus coal mine, Occidental Petroleum and Royal Caribbean.
Another stock likely to be in focus is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa), which said at the weekend it bought back a record $5.1 billion in stock in the second quarter.
4. German companies see 9 more months of disruption
How long will it take life to return to normal after the coronavirus? Around 9 months, according to a survey of German firms by the Munich-based think-tank Ifo.
Ifo said the sports and leisure industry, along with the arts and other entertainment-related businesses, face the longest disruption, stretching all through next summer.  Drinks and pharma companies see things back to normal within seven months, while the key automotive sector estimates eight months.
The survey reinforces perceptions that industry will lead the way out of recession, while the outlook for service sectors is much bleaker.
5. Upbeat Aramco puts a floor under crude
Crude oil prices stabilized after Saudi Aramco chief executive officer Amin Nasser gave an upbeat forecasts for demand, saying he expected it to continue rising through the end of the year.
Aramco also stuck to its promise to pay around $75 billion in dividends this year, despite a sharp drop in profits. That distinguishes it from the bulk of its rivals in the oil and gas major sector, who have had to reset their dividend payouts at lower levels in expectation of a lengthy period of low prices.
Aramco is the world’s most profitable company, thanks to its extraordinarily low marginal production costs.
U.S. crude futures were up 1.4% at $41.80 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent was up 1.0% at $44.83 a barrel"
1275,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>","Zen monk, Zoom and virus: inside Argentina's $65 billion debt deal","BUENOS AIRES/LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the clock ticked past midnight on Aug. 4, Argentine negotiators knew a deal was close to break the deadlock on a $65 billion debt deal, one of the biggest ever sovereign restructurings which has tested global financial markets.
The talks, on a knife-edge as tensions rose between officials and creditors, had been dragged back on course by last-ditch calls between government advisers, major creditors including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), which clashed openly with Argentina earlier this year, and Economy Minister Martin Guzman. 
Guzman and BlackRock's key negotiator Jennifer O'Neil, in weekend talks, had arrived by Sunday night at the framework of a deal bridging the gap between the two sides. It needed to be cleared with other creditors, but the involvement of the world's largest asset manager was key to getting it across the line. 
Guzman gave the green light to advisers, including top executives from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and HSBC, saying: ""Get it finished"", one person close to the talks recalled.
Talks had twisted since the start of the year in a process hindered by the coronavirus pandemic, sailing past multiple deadlines as key creditors clashed with Guzman, a 37-year-old economist with close ties to Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz.
In mid-June, two of the major creditor groups slammed the negotiations as having failed. A ""final"" government offer made in early July was rejected too and that same Sunday Guzman warned creditors a no deal would see talks stall for months.
Now, with the political will behind a deal, advisers including Bank of America's country chief Sebastián Loketek sat across the digital negotiating table from O'Neil and Pablo Federico from Ayres Capital, another important creditor.
Guzman was on a constant direct line.
""The negotiation that started on Sunday was intense, it was tough,"" the first person said. ""We slept two or three hours between Sunday to Tuesday at 3 a.m.""
Calls went on between the creditors to rally behind the proposal which settled at around 54.8 cents on the dollar, a compromise between what had become entrenched positions of the government and the three creditor groups that unified in July.
On Monday morning creditors held a 9 a.m. call to discuss the proposal, a second person close to the talks said. An outline of what the groups would accept was sent back on WhatsApp, a third person said, before lawyers for both sides worked on Monday afternoon to bulletproof a final statement.
Graham (NYSE:GHM) Stock, an emerging markets strategist at creditor BlueBay Asset Management, part of the so-called Ad Hoc group with BlackRock, said everything had been ""fluid"" right up until Monday. But the concessions got ""unanimous"" support.
""They managed to craft a midway point between our latest proposal and the government's latest offer that was satisfactory to other members of the group and to the government.""
At 3.01 a.m. on Tuesday Guzman wrote on Twitter that Argentina and the three key creditor groups had reached a deal.
""Right up until the press release was sent I was never 100% certain,"" said the second person. ""There was tension all the way until the end.""
'PERSONAL CONNECTION'
At times a deal had looked a distant prospect, raising fears of legal battles that Argentina's creditors recalled only too well from a messy restructuring after a default in 2001-02 that left the country as a pariah in global markets.
At a low-point in the talks in May, government officials aimed barbs, especially at another of BlackRock's negotiators Gerardo Rodriguez, a former Mexican finance undersecretary who had been key to raising BlackRock's exposure in the grains powerhouse during the previous government of Mauricio Macri.
Creditors criticized Guzman for side-lining people in talks.
A source close to the government recalled an early exchange during which Rodriguez told Guzman creditors may ""just wait for the next government, however soon that may be"".
As talks progressed, officials and creditors said Rodriguez took a less prominent role while O'Neil, an expert on corporate restructuring, came to the fore.
During increasingly frequent phone calls in English - O'Neil speaks no Spanish - she and Guzman discussed their shared interests in running and New York City, where the minister had spent some time, before diving into technicalities over debt.
""There was a personal connection which helped establish some level of trust,"" said a person close to the talks.
BlackRock declined to comment and Reuters could not reach Rodriguez, its portfolio manager for emerging markets.
'ZEN-LIKE CALMNESS'
Guzman, though politically untested, was an academic expert on sovereign restructurings. Since taking office he has helped Argentina get strong support from prominent economists and built a close relationship with the IMF and even Pope Francis.
Stiglitz, Guzman's mentor at Columbia University and co-author of many papers including one on economic crises published during the talks, said the minister carries ""Zen-like calmness, laser focus and expertise.""
""He brought in a knowledge set and analytic ability that was unusual,"" Stiglitz told Reuters. ""The Alpha males in the credit world are used to dealing with countries that don't have that degree of confidence."" 
Riccardo Grassi, risk manager at creditor Mangart Capital Advisors, agreed the minister was usually calm but said he could at times become irritated. The person close to the government and with direct knowledge of the talks described Guzman as ""like a Zen monk warrior.""
Guzman did not respond to requests for comment.
After sweeping into power in December, Fernandez and Guzman made their first offer to creditors in April. At around 40 cents on the dollar it was an aggressive opening gambit.
Gorky Urquieta, co-head of emerging markets debt at Neuberger Berman, a holder of Argentine bonds, echoed many creditors, calling the initial offer ""absolutely unacceptable."" 
""It needed five minutes to reject it,"" he said. 
Since then, Urquieta said, the talks had been ""very Argentina style, a lot of drama around it, a big, long saga that seems to be coming close to a resolution.""
'MOMENT OF HAPPINESS'
That drama was heightened by the pandemic. Argentina imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 20 and closed its borders, meaning negotiations that once would have been face-to-face suddenly had to be done on video platforms like Zoom.
As the endgame neared, creditors said advisers like UBS and Mens Sana helped eased tensions, helping navigate local politics and facilitate easing communication between the creditors themselves, who were at time fragmented.
Others identified important go-betweens like Sergio Massa, the well-connected head of Argentina's lower house of Congress.
""Sergio helped a lot to prevent people from exploding,"" the first source said, adding that Massa's role was to assure his markets contacts ""that Argentina wanted to fix things.""
In mid-July creditors rallied behind their own proposal, demanding changes to legal clauses and around 3 cents on the dollar more in value. The groups - that together could block a deal - rejected the government's 'final' proposal.
Carl Ross at GMO, who was on the steering committee of the Argentina Creditor Committee, said the groups combining was vital for leverage, but also there was growing recognition that backing the government into a corner came with risks. 
""It was clear that politically it was going to be impossible (for Argentina to raise the offer) and there was a risk the more radical elements would win out,"" he said.
When the final Zoom calls were made to seal the agreement, Marcelo Delmar, an advisor from Mens Sana, said there was more a sense of relief than euphoria. 
Creditors still have to formally accept the deal by an Aug. 24 deadline, though three of the people close to the talks said it looked like at least 85-90% would take part, maybe more.

""Yes it was a moment of happiness,"" said Delmar. ""But then life goes on.""

1276,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>","Senators urge U.S. to remove tariffs on EU foods, beverages","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of 13 U.S. senators have asked the U.S. Trade Representative's Office (USTR) to remove 25% tariffs imposed in October 2019 on European Union food, wine and spirits, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
The tariffs, in retaliation for EU subsidies on large aircraft, hit French wine, Italian cheese and single-malt Scotch whisky, as well as cookies, salami, yogurt, olives from France, EU-produced pork sausage and German coffee.
Seven Republican and six Democratic senators, including Robert Menendez, John Barrasso, Cory Gardner, Susan Collins, Dianne Feinstein, Pat Toomey, Kyrsten Sinema and Cory Booker said in a letter to USTR Friday that American ""restaurants, retailers, grocers, importers and distributors"" are experiencing ""severe economic hardship due to the increased cost of goods.""
The senators noted ""demand for these goods has declined, leaving importers and distributors with months’ worth of product, much of it perishable, in storage and in transit with no clear end date for the COVID-19 pandemic.""
USTR did not immediately comment.
Last month, Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) said it would increase loan repayments to France and Spain in a ""final"" bid to reverse U.S. tariffs and jog the United States into settling a 16-year-old dispute over billions of dollars of aircraft subsidies.
The United States last year won World Trade Organization authorization to impose tariffs on up to $7.5 billion of EU goods.
The U.S. Distilled Spirits Council last month urged ending EU and U.S. beverage tariffs, saying drinks firms on both sides of the Atlantic ""have suffered enough.""
The group noted Scotch Whisky imports by the United States fell nearly 33% between October 2019 and May 2020, a $378 million decline over the same period a year earlier.
The EU in a separate dispute imposed 25% tariffs  on all U.S. whiskey imports in June 2018. Since then, U.S. whiskey exports to the EU have fallen by 33%, or $300 million, the group said.
Trade groups are bracing for an escalation this autumn when the EU is expected to win WTO approval to retaliate with its own tariffs over subsidies for U.S. planemaker  Boeing Co  (N:BA). 

USTR announced in June it was considering imposing additional tariffs on products from many EU countries including gin, vodka, beer, sparkling wine and other whiskies.

1278,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 05:18AM ET</span>","Sharp, Short U.S. Recession Giving Way to Longer-Term Scarring","(Bloomberg) -- The pandemic-induced downturn initially had hints of being the sharpest but shortest U.S. recession on record. Now there are increasing signs of economic scarring that resemble past slumps.
Beneath a headline number showing a better-than-expected gain in July jobs, the government’s employment report contained indications of underlying weakness.
Payrolls remain 13 million below pre-pandemic levels and the number of people out of work for 15 weeks or longer more than doubled from the prior month, to 8 million. The labor-force participation rate fell for the first time in three months and the number of people discouraged by job prospects hit a five-year high.
Such figures, along with recent high-frequency indicators pointing to a pause in the recovery, suggest the pandemic slump will be more drawn-out.
With lawmakers failing to extend supplemental unemployment benefits that have supported incomes and spending, President Donald Trump signed orders over the weekend to provide limited relief that faces questions over its implementation and legality.
Reports due later this week on July retail sales, industrial production and consumer sentiment are expected to confirm a moderating pace of economic activity.
“There’s definitely a lot of work to be done in getting the economy back to where it used to be,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.
Trump’s latest moves create “some downside risk to the outlook as it removes pressure on Congress to agree to something more comprehensive,” he said.
Read more:
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). economists took a different view, saying in a note that because the new jobless benefits could run out in a month, it could raise pressure on lawmakers to do more.
In any case, some of the long-term economic and labor-market effects of the virus have already been set in motion, such as a lengthening duration of unemployment. Others will take longer to develop: wage gains coming under pressure, the impact on female labor-market participation as schools extend virtual classes and the effect of shaky job prospects for recent graduates.
Unemployment Duration
The number of Americans who have been unemployed for at least 15 weeks grew by about 4.7 million people in July. That was the biggest monthly increase in records back to 1948 and highlights the need for fiscal relief.
In the wake of the last recession, the number of people in the 15 weeks or more category hit a record 9.1 million in 2010, and it took four years to reduce that by half. Just how fast Americans will be able to get back to work this time is unclear.
“When we look at where we go from here, we’re past that mechanical bounceback,” said Sarah House, senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. “Now you have to justify, from a cost perspective, bringing back new workers. And for that you need revenue to increase” and economic activity to improve, she said.
Economic Spillover
The economy is forecast to rebound in the third quarter but recovering to pre-pandemic levels could take years. Meanwhile, the replacement of the extra $600 in weekly jobless benefits with a smaller amount and a lack of new funding for the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses means less spending and investment in the economy.
“This slowing trend in the economic recovery is deeply concerning,” said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at jobs website Glassdoor. “The risk is that will spill over to businesses and the rest of the economy, as well as households.”
And Trump’s order to provide more stimulus “doesn’t change the overriding fact that the public health crisis will determine the trajectory of the economy,” Zhao said.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“Following an unprecedented swing from severe drop to sharp rebound, the economy is entering more conventional recession dynamics. A prolonged period of elevated unemployment and subdued participation in the labor market will weigh heavily on income growth, personal spending and top-line growth.”
-- Yelena Shulyatyeva, Andrew Husby and Eliza Winger
Read more for the full note on the jobs report.
Workforce participation has also come under pressure. The overall participation rate and that of prime-age workers, or those age 25-54, edged lower in July.
At the start of the year, the rate among prime-age workers had finally clawed its way back to levels more consistent with those prior to the 2007-2009 recession. That took over a decade and was driven by a key group -- women.
Around downturns, participation tends to decrease at least in part because of a lack of job opportunities. But for women in particular, the closing of childcare businesses, summer camps and uncertainty around school reopenings adds pressure on them while working from home, or after being laid off.
Job losses may also have a deeper impact on Black workers, like in the last recession. While the White unemployment rate has already dropped by 5 percentage points since its pandemic high in April, the rate for Black Americans has declined by just 2.2 points since its pandemic high in May.
The longer it takes the economy to recover, the worse it will be for wages as a weak jobs market reduces worker bargaining power. For the employed, that may mean a skipped raise or even a pay cut. For the jobless searching for a new position, an enormous pool of applicants may mean accepting less pay.

The government aims to attract foreign investments in pre-identified areas, promote joint ventures and support local businesses to expand India's share of global markets, Nitin Gadkari, India's minister for MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises), told a virtual conference. 
""There is an opportunity for India in sectors where China enjoys a big share in the global market,"" he said.

Xiao Gang, former chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said that against the background of a large increase in bank credit, banks faced an ""arduous task"" of making up for cash shortfalls for maturing old products.
Regulatory crackdowns on wealth management products, in particular structured deposits, have led to a surge in issues of negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs), short-term debt instruments traded in the interbank bond market, to make up for the shortfall in bank liabilities.
The transition from wealth management products should ""fully respect reality"" and not be rushed, Xiao, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a high-profile advisory body, told an asset management forum on Sunday.
The government recently extended the grace period for the implementation of new asset management rules to the end of 2021, with the aim of reducing pressure on lenders hit by the coronavirus.
Reuters reported in June that China's banking and insurance regulator had told banks to scale back on high-yield structured deposits, which combine traditional deposits with higher-return investment products, after banks had aggressively marketed them to attract funds.
With a major source of funding squeezed, banks have turned to NCDs.
Data from the Shanghai Clearing House showed that banks issued NCDs worth 1.71 trillion yuan ($245.50 billion) in July, up 26.6% from a month earlier.
""It may be an early sign of the comeback of shadow banking if the expansion continues on a larger scale, which could divert liquidity designated for the real economy towards financial arbitrage,"" said Gary Ng, an economist at Natixis in Hong Kong.
Ming Ming, an analyst at CITIC Securities, said in a note that net financing by the instruments fell in the first half of the year, as loose monetary policy meant banks did not need to issue many to meet funding demands.
Shifting central bank policy since May has led to more demand for funds raised through NCDs and smaller net financing in the previous period means a need for more current issuance, driving up prices, said Ming.
On Friday, AAA rated three-month NCDs yielded 2.5874%, according to Refinitiv, compared with 1.2001% in early April. 
Chinese regulators have in the past clamped down on banks' use of NCDs as a funding tool after smaller lenders used them as a tool for speculation on longer-term investments.

1282,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2020 03:45AM ET</span>",Factbox: How financial firms in Hong Kong may be affected by U.S. sanctions,"By Alun John and Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The United States has imposed sanctions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and 10 other top Hong Kong and Chinese officials over what Washington says is their role in curtailing political freedoms in the territory. 
The sanctions, which came on Aug. 7, more than a month after Beijing imposed national security legislation on Hong Kong, will freeze any U.S. assets of the officials and generally bar Americans and American companies from doing business with them.
The security law, which has drawn condemnation from Western governments, was imposed in late June. Supporters said it would restore stability after a year of often-violent pro-democracy, anti-China protests. 
Below are the main ramifications and concerns for financial firms in Hong Kong. 
Will financial firms implementing sanctions run afoul of the national security law?
Under the law, it is a crime to receive ""instructions, control or funding from a foreign country ... to impose sanctions or blockade"" against Hong Kong or mainland China. 
It is uncertain whether abiding by U.S. sanctions would breach this aspect of the law, legal experts say. 
""Short answer is potentially yes, as the original Chinese text of Article 29(4) (of the security law) states that carrying out sanctions of a foreign government against HK or the PRC (People's Republic of China) would be a violation,"" said Mini vandePol, Asia Pacific head of Baker McKenzie's compliance and investigations group.
""This is an expansive interpretation and would have immense ramifications on many businesses in Hong Kong,"" she added. ""To this day, we have not yet seen any enforcement of Article 29(4) in this way, nor has there been official guidance on this point.""
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said in a circular on Saturday the sanctions had no legal status in Hong Kong, and unlike United Nations sanctions, banks in Hong Kong were under no obligation to comply with them.
When asked by Reuters whether or not banks were prohibited from enforcing the sanctions, the HKMA said it had nothing to add to the circular. 
A blog post by two respected legal scholars published in late July said financial firms would not breach the law ""merely by participating in the implementation of the sanctions"" but they could become liable in certain exceptional circumstances. 
The blog post was written by Albert Chen and Simon Young, both professors at Hong Kong University's law faculty. 
Which types of financial firms are affected by the sanctions and how?
U.S. banks and asset managers operating in the United States cannot do business with any of the 11 sanctioned people or any companies those people control.
""It is likely that U.S. banks operating in Hong Kong will follow their headquarters' instructions on this on account closure,"" said Josephine Chung, solicitor and CompliancePlus Consulting director.
Non-U.S. firms can continue to provide banking services to the sanctioned people, but when doing so they cannot also work with the U.S. financial system, people or companies. 
Is there more to come for foreign financial firms in Hong Kong?
Yes. Friday's sanctions were imposed under an Executive Order signed by President Donald Trump on July 14.
That order adds to the United States' Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which also creates a process for identifying and sanctioning foreign financial firms that knowingly engage in ""significant transactions"" with people who contributed to the current situation in Hong Kong.

The people on this list have not yet been named nor is there clarity about what constitutes a significant transaction.

In its monthly update on business conditions, the central bank said on Monday the euro zone's second biggest economy contracted 13.8%, in line with its forecast.
""The rebound continued in July, at a more moderate rhythm, in line with the trajectory anticipated last month,"" the bank said.
In June, economic activity was 9% below normal levels, up from the 32% reduction seen during the first two weeks of lockdown in March.
The positive trend continued just as France and other European governments took new measures to curb a renewed rise in infection rates, desperate to avoid a return to the lockdowns that battered economies globally.
In the manufacturing industry, capacity utilisation in July rose 3 points to 72%.
Manufacturing and service sector activity would be stable in August, the bank projected.

WASHINGTON/Morristown, NJ (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday said they were open to restarting COVID-19 aid talks, after weeks of failed negotiations prompted President Donald Trump to take executive actions that Democrats argued would do little to ease Americans' financial distress.
Discussions over a fifth bill to address the impact of the coronavirus pandemic fell apart on Friday, a week after the expiration of a critical boost in unemployment assistance and eviction protections, exposing people to a wave of economic pain as infections continue to rise across the country.
Trump on Saturday sought to take matters into his own hands, signing executive orders and memorandums aimed at unemployment benefits, evictions, student loans and payroll taxes.
Trump told reporters in New Jersey before returning to Washington on Sunday that his suspension of the collection of the payroll tax could be made permanent. He said doing so would have no impact on Social Security because reimbursement would be made through the general fund.
Trump, noting that Democrats want to resume stimulus discussions, said the White House would be willing to talk to them again ""if it's not a waste of time.""
Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, called Trump's orders a ""series of half-baked measures"" and accused him of putting Social Security, the government pension plan for the elderly, ""at grave risk"" by delaying the collection of payroll taxes that pay for the program.
""This will have zero impact on Social Security,"" Trump said.
""It may be permanent, we're looking into it,"" he added. ""We'll take it out till the end of the year and then I'm going to make a decision as to, number one, an extension, and number two, make it permanent and no reimbursement.""
Trump's move came as the number of U.S. cases of COVID-19 rose past 5 million. More than 160,000 Americans have died. Trump's orders also raised questions about the legality of bypassing Congress' constitutional powers to tax and spend. 
On Sunday, both Pelosi and Mnuchin appeared willing to consider a narrower deal that would extend some aid until the end of the year, and then revisit the need for more federal assistance in January. That would come after November's election, which could rebalance power in Washington.
""Let's pass legislation on things that we agree on,"" Mnuchin told Fox News in an interview. ""We don't have to get everything done at once. ... What we should do is get things done for the American public now, come back for another bill afterwards."" 
Pelosi dismissed Trump's orders as unconstitutional and ""illusions"" that would not quickly or directly help Americans. She said separately to ""Fox News Sunday"" that a deal between congressional Democrats and the White House was essential.
""Right now, we need to come to agreement,"" she said, adding that Democrats could shorten the length of time aid is provided in order to bring the bill's costs down closer to the Trump administration's proposal. 
""We could talk about how long our provisions would be in effect, so we can take things down -- instead of the end of September of next year, a shorter period of time -- and we'll revisit all of it next year anyway,"" said Pelosi, whose fellow Democrats control the U.S. House of Representatives.
Mnuchin appeared open to consider the idea, telling Fox: ""Anytime they have a new proposal, I am willing to listen.""
$2 TRILLION GAP
The House passed a $3.4 trillion coronavirus support package in May that the Republican-led Senate ignored for weeks before putting forward a $1 trillion counteroffer.
Democrats, pushing hard to keep a $600 per week unemployment benefit, which is a supplement to state jobless payments, and deliver more funds to cash-strapped states and cities battered by the pandemic, had offered to meet Republicans halfway to close the $2 trillion gap -- a move the White House rejected.
On Sunday, Mnuchin urged lawmakers to accept the money the administration was willing to lay out now to help schools reopen, boost local coffers and help the jobless, even if it fell short of Democrats' goals.
While it remained unclear whether there would be formal legal challenges to Trump's orders, some legal and tax experts said his actions took few concrete steps to provide immediate relief.
""It's basically nothing,"" Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law, said of Trump's move directing his Cabinet to look at the issue of evictions.
Trump's memo on unemployment aid did not extend benefits under the current system, but instead authorized a separate system that would have to be paid for in part by the states, which are already struggling to pay benefits amid a wave joblessness not seen since the Great Depression.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNN on Sunday it was unclear how states would come up with the additional money, while Mnuchin on Fox said, ""They can either take that out of the money we've already given them or the president can waive that.""
Democratic New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, vice chair of the National Governors Association, said states cannot afford to pay 25% of unemployment costs as outlined by the president. ""It's simply impossible,"" Cuomo wrote on Twitter. 
Trump's memo calling on companies to defer withholding payroll taxes changed the deadline for when such taxes were due but did not eliminate them. It would rely on employers' compliance and does not help Americans who are out of work. 
A fourth memo allowed borrowers to defer payments on student loans.

Pelosi declined to say whether Democrats would challenge the legality of Trump's actions in court.

Evans said it was up to U.S. lawmakers to protect small businesses and vulnerable communities with measures that ensure they can continue to pay their rent and buy food as long as the virus was not under control.
""I think that public confidence is really important and another support package is really incredibly important,"" Evans said on CBS's Face the Nation program.
He also said that the most pessimistic economic projections involved not supporting state and local governments, which in turn would have to implement drastic cuts to support some of the federal aid measures.
Evans' comments come after U.S. lawmakers failed to strike an agreement on a second aid package after weeks of negotiations, leaving tens of millions of unemployed Americans without direct federal support.

In a statement to an emergency donor conference for Lebanon, the IMF's managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, laid out reforms expected, including steps to restore the solvency of public finances and the soundness of the financial system, and temporary safeguards to avoid continued capital outflows.
Even before the massive explosion that killed 158 people and destroyed swathes of Beirut on Tuesday, a financial crisis had led Lebanon to enter negotiations with the IMF in May after it defaulted on its foreign currency debt. Those talks were put on hold in the absence of reforms.
“We are ready to redouble our efforts. But we need unity of purpose in Lebanon — we need all institutions to come together determined to carry out much needed reforms,"" Georgieva said. 
""Commitment to these reforms will unlock billions of dollars for the benefit of the Lebanese people. This is the moment for the country’s policymakers to act decisively. We stand ready to help,"" she said.
Georgieva also called on Lebanon to take steps to reduce the protracted losses in many state-owned enterprises and expand a social safety net to protect the country's most vulnerable people.
Lebanon's financial crisis came to a head in October as capital inflows slowed and protests erupted over corruption and bad governance. 
Sunday's donor conference raised pledges worth nearly 253 million euros ($298 million) for immediate humanitarian relief after the blast, the French presidency said, adding that those commitments would not be conditional on political or institutional reform.

Pledges were also made for longer-term support that would depend on changes by the authorities.

“Those who benefited from past excessive returns need to share the burden of bank recapitalization, to protect the life savings of the vast majority of ordinary Lebanese depositors,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement on Sunday.
The IMF is seeking reforms as it negotiates billions of dollars of loans for the country. The Middle Eastern nation must also adopt safeguards to avoid further capital outflows, including putting in place legislation to formalize capital controls in the banking system.
The international lender also urged Lebanon to eliminate its multiple exchange rate system to stop further deterioration in its currency, and to curb corruption, Georgieva said.

“Fiscal policy has been unbelievably important in supporting the economy during the downturn that we’ve been experiencing,” Evans said in an interview Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”
“That continues to be important because we’ve not got control over the virus spread. I think that public confidence is really important, and another support package is really incredibly important,” he said.
President Donald Trump on Saturday took executive actions on relief to work around a Congressional impasse on additional fiscal support, though the measures fall well short of the aid that Democrats say is needed amid a stalling U.S. economic recovery and with millions of Americans still out of work.
Democrats and Republicans are trillions of dollars apart on overall spending and on key issues, including on aid to state and local governments and the amount of supplementary unemployment benefits that expired at the end of last month.
Fed officials have cut interest rates to nearly zero and signaled they would keep them there at least through 2022 as they try to get the economy back on track. High frequency signals on activity show an economic rebound flattening out, though the latest monthly reading on the labor market was better than expected.

1293,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 09, 2020 06:39AM ET</span>",Economic Calendar - Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,"By Noreen Burke
Investing.com -- With stock markets now in the August doldrums investors this week will stay focused on the twin risks of heightened U.S.- China tensions and developments in Washington on the next round of coronavirus pandemic relief. Market participants will also be watching the dollar, which despite a rebound after Friday’s U.S. jobs report notched up its seventh straight weekly loss, the longest such streak in a decade. On the economic calendar, Thursday will bring the weekly jobless claims numbers, followed by retail sales figures for July on Friday. China is also to release a deluge of what will be closely watched economic data and earnings season will enter the final stretch. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
After failing to reach a deal with the U.S. Congress for a fresh round of coronavirus pandemic relief, President Donald Trump on Saturday signed a series of executive orders aimed at bolstering the hard-hit economy.
However, details on how the measures could be funded remain unclear and Democrats have already warned that such executive orders are legally dubious and would likely be challenged in court.
Uncertainty over fresh stimulus measures coincides with a renewed deterioration in ties between Washington and Beijing. Last week Trump unveiled sweeping bans on Chinese tech firms TikTok and Tencent, escalating a high-stakes confrontation over the future of the global tech industry.
Uncertainty associated with the dual risks will likely continue to act as a dampener on market sentiment, analysts said.
The U.S. Dollar bounced on Friday after jobs numbers for July helped ease some investor worries on the U.S. labor market, but the currency logged a seventh straight week of declines.
While the U.S. economy added a slightly larger than forecast 1.76 million jobs last month it was still sharply lower than the record 4.8 million in June.
Sentiment has turned against the greenback due to a combination of rising U.S. coronavirus infections, a steady decline in Treasury yields, and a lack of consensus in Washington over additional stimulus.
Analysts say the dollar will continue to fall, particularly against the euro, the yen and Swiss franc, as expectations for a V-shaped recovery from the pandemic fades and investors take a more sanguine view of markets.
""I see further dollar weakness,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.
""Optimism for an economic recovery is not backed up by the data. Safe-havens are very high, but stocks are also high, which doesn't make sense. The party has to end at some point.""
Data this week covers July so should remain largely upbeat, with Friday’s reports on industrial production and retail sales expected to show that the recovery from lockdown measures continued. A separate report on preliminary consumer sentiment for August will offer insight into whether the economy can continue to recover amid the pandemic.
Ahead of that, Thursday’s weekly report on initial jobless claims will show whether job losses continued their decline after last week’s figures showed the lowest weekly total since late March when layoffs around the U.S. exploded due to statewide lockdowns.
Wednesday’s consumer price inflation data will also be in the spotlight amid expectations that inflation will eventually start to creep higher on the back of a weaker dollar and the bloated budget deficit. U.S. CPI rebounded in June after three straight monthly declines.
China, the first country to be struck by the pandemic is set to release a raft of economic data this week with investors looking for signs that the recovery in the world's second-largest economy can be sustained.
Data on Friday is expected to show that industrial production remained steady last month while retail sales are expected to return to positive territory after contracting. The economic calendar also features updates on fixed investment, consumer and home price inflation, along with monetary and lending indicators.
Meanwhile, senior U.S. and Chinese officials will review the implementation of their Phase 1 trade deal during a video conference on Saturday.
Earnings season is entering the final stretch and some of the bigger names reporting this week include Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY),  Canopy Growth  (NYSE:CGC), SeaWorld (NYSE:SEAS) and Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) on Monday. Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) is due to report on Tuesday, followed by Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) on Wednesday.  Coach  parent company Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) and Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) are among the names to report on Thursday.
With the second-quarter corporate earnings season largely over, about 82% of S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten dramatically lowered estimates, with earnings on average coming in 22.5% above expectations, the highest on record according to Reuters data.

British Trade Minister Lizz Truss said in a statement that they ""have reached consensus on the major elements of a deal,"" and both have announced that they will agree on the principles of a trade deal by the end of August.
However, despite reassurances that the two countries had by and large reached an agreement, auto tariffs and agricultural products have proven to be a sticking point in the negotiations.

The INEGI national statistics agency has said some 12 million jobs in total were lost between March and May, much of that stemming from temporary work suspensions caused by lockdown measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Nearly 5 million people returned to work in June, INEGI says, as the economy has reopened.
""The informal economy is also picking up. There's more activity on the street,"" said Lopez Obrador.
The president said that consumption is also picking up, thanks to social programs that benefit the poor and remittances, the bulk of which are sent home by the millions of Mexicans living in the United States. 
He forecast that remittances could reach $40 billion in 2020, which would be a major boon for the Mexican economy which contracted by a historic 17.3% in the second quarter from the previous three months.

Remittances rose in June to $3.54 billion, the second highest level since records began in 1995.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina will start talks with the International Monetary Fund in the coming weeks aimed at clinching a new program to replace a defunct $57 billion standby lending deal from two years ago, a top IMF official told Reuters on Saturday.
In 2018, Argentina received the biggest lending package in IMF history in an ill-fated bid to halt a slide in the local peso currency. About $44 billion of the allotted cash has been paid out so far.
""Within the next few weeks Argentina plans to formally request the initiation of conversations for a new program that would succeed the derailed and canceled 2018 program,"" said Sergio Chodos, IMF executive director for the Southern Cone.
""There is no stringent deadline for conclusion of the upcoming talks because the calendar of maturities of principal owed to the fund does not start until Sept. 21, 2021. So the discussion process can be well thought out,"" Chodos said in a telephone interview.
New lending from the IMF will not be part of the upcoming accord, he added. The government has had to renegotiate about $65 billion in bonds as the country sinks into what is expected to be a 12.5% recession this year.
""We stand ready to support Argentina, including engaging with the authorities on a new IMF-supported program when the authorities so desire. However, at this stage no request has been made,"" a fund spokesman said in an emailed statement.
The government is talking with undecided bondholders about supporting a sovereign debt restructuring deal it reached several days ago with key creditors groups. The government had said it would finalize the bond restructuring before setting out to revamp its IMF agreement. 
Argentina's previous government ran into a cash crunch two years ago after President Mauricio Macri's austerity drive, which included cuts to energy subsidies, jacked up electricity bills paid by businesses. Vendors increased consumer prices to help cover their rising energy costs, fueling inflation.
The foreign direct investment that Macri promised would be attracted by his market-friendly policies never materialized.

Macri was voted out of office last year and succeeded by Peronist Alberto Fernandez, who has vowed not to impose fiscal austerity while the country grapples with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong financial regulators sought to calm market fears on Saturday as global financial firms in Hong Kong weighed cutting ties with local clients after the United States imposed sanctions on senior Hong Kong and Chinese officials.
Washington imposed sanctions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and 10 other top officials for what it calls their role in curtailing political freedoms in the territory, prompting a sharp rebuke from Beijing.
The escalation in U.S-China tensions comes after Beijing imposed sweeping national security legislation on the financial hub in late June. Western governments condemned the law, while supporters said it would restore stability after a year of often-violent pro-democracy, anti-China protests.
Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission ""is not aware of any aspect of the (law) or the U.S. sanctions ... that would affect the way in which firms carry on their normal operations in Hong Kong"", said a spokesman for the Hong Kong markets regulator.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the banking regulator, said in a circular that ""unilateral sanctions"" had no legal status in Hong Kong, and unlike United Nations sanctions, banks in Hong Kong were under no obligation to comply with them.
The circular did not elaborate on the impact on the financial sector. 
After Friday's sanctions, which the Hong Kong government called ""shameless and despicable"", U.S. and non U.S.-banks are assessing what action to take amid fears of getting caught in the crosshairs of Sino-U.S. tensions.
""Most foreign banks in Hong Kong have been working internally for the last few weeks to prepare a list of people who will the main target of the U.S. sanctions,"" said a senior banker with a leading European bank in Hong Kong. 
Banks in Hong Kong will now ""forensically examine the networks of the people named on the sanctions lists and see if there are any banking relationships which would put the banks at risk,"" another banking source said.
The sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The sanctions prevent U.S. companies and people globally from any dealings with the 11 sanctioned people.
They do not directly apply to non-U.S. entities, ""but those companies would breach the rules if they dealt with a sanctioned person while also interacting with a U.S. person or the U.S. financial system, for example a bank processing a wire transaction via a U.S. correspondent bank,"" said Nick Turner, a lawyer specializing in sanctions and anti-money laundering at the law firm of Steptoe and Johnson in Hong Kong.

Spot gold prices hit another record high Friday, touching $2,073.41 an ounce, before turning lower to settle at $2,035.12 by close of trade.
 
The yellow metal has thrived in recent months thanks to low interest rates and a flood of stimulus from the Federal Reserve and U.S. government.

It climbed to a one-year high of $12,061 at the start of the month, bringing its gains on the year to nearly 65% so far.
 
Bitcoin has sometimes been called “digital gold”, with its supporters saying it could be a good safe-haven investment that investors buy in times of uncertainty.
 
In contrast, the U.S. dollar has been on the backfoot lately, with the dollar index ending lower for the seventh week in a row.
 
It slid to 92.52 earlier in the week, its lowest since May 2018.
 
The rapid resurgence in U.S. Covid-19 cases combined with the huge quantities of stimulus coursing through the financial system have been weighing on the greenback, which has fallen about 3% in 2020.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - The constitutional chamber of El Salvador's Supreme Court of Justice on Friday declared an executive decree that would establish protocols for the gradual reopening of the economy as unconstitutional. 
President Nayib Bukele and Congress have clashed over how to manage the pandemic and the country's gradual reopening. 
Bukele had released an executive decree on July 29 that set out a calendar for a gradual reopening of the poor Central American economy.
But in its ruling, the court stated that the new measures ""contradict constitutional parameters established"" earlier to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
Early on, Bukele had taken some of the strictest measures in the region.
""In every country in the world, governments are ordering reopening, gradually, to control the pandemic,"" he said on Twitter. ""In El Salvador, today that is also unconstitutional."" 

So far, El Salvador has reported 19,544 confirmed cases and 520 deaths.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force said on Friday it awarded United Launch Alliance (ULA) and Elon Musk's SpaceX $653 million in combined military launch contracts under the Pentagon's next-generation, multibillion-dollar launch capability program.
The contracts are for launch service orders beginning in 2022 and allocate $337 million to ULA, a joint venture between Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), and $316 million to SpaceX for the first missions of roughly 34 total that the two rocket firms will support through 2027.
ULA will receive a contract for approximately 60% of those launch service orders using its next-generation Vulcan rocket while Musk's SpaceX, using its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, will receive approximately 40%, the Air Force's acquisition chief Will Roper told reporters on Friday.
The awards are part of the Pentagon's 2014 mandate from Congress to curb its dependency on rockets using Russia’s RD-180 engine and transition to U.S.-made rockets for launching Washington's most sensitive national security payloads to space.
The program, called National Security Space Launch Phase 2, is aimed at ""building a competitive industry base that we hope doesn't just help military and national security missions, but that helps our nation continue to compete and dominate in space,"" Roper added.
""Today’s awards mark a new epoch of space launch that will finally transition the Department off Russian RD-180 engines,"" Roper said in a statement.
The two companies lay claim to billions of dollars in lucrative military contracts for a span of five years that competitors Blue Origin, the space company of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) owner Jeff Bezos, and  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) also competed for.

The economic outlook in the monthly report polling 44 economists was down from a 12% estimated drop previously.
Economists predicted a larger fiscal deficit of around 2 trillion Argentine pesos ($27.49 billion) as the government steps up spending to reignite the economy after two years of recession and to recover from COVID-19.
Those polled forecast a deeper contraction in the second quarter, but had a more positive outlook for the third quarter, ""indicating that the period of greatest impact of the pandemic has already been overcome,"" the report said.
Argentina has registered 235,677 confirmed infections of COVID-19, with daily cases accelerating in recent weeks as the country has looked to ease some lockdown restrictions in place in and around Buenos Aires, the capital.
The country, which defaulted in May, reached a deal with creditors this week to restructure $65 billion in foreign debt.

The central bank survey also estimated inflation for 2020 at 39.5%, slightly down from its month-earlier forecast. The peso currency was seen rising to 86.4 pesos per dollar in December 2020 and 123.2 pesos per dollar in December 2021.

BUENOS AIRES/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Support grew in Latin America on Friday for a move to delay the election of a new president for the region's leading development finance lender, a potential setback for U.S. President Donald Trump's divisive pick to lead the institution.
The U.S. candidate, Mauricio Claver-Carone, a Trump adviser known for his hard-line stance on Venezuela and Cuba, is the current favorite to win the top spot at the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), which is set to hold a vote on the matter next month.
Claver-Carone would become the first person from outside Latin America to lead the Washington-based bank, a smaller cousin of the International Monetary Fund that has been led by Latin Americans since its founding in 1959.
But calls from within the region for a different approach have been growing.
Mexico's finance ministry said on Friday that the vote should be postponed ""until the conditions were right,"" echoing a similar call on Thursday from Chile.
Argentina's Senate foreign affairs committee said in a statement on Friday that it unanimously supported having a Latin American candidate run the bank.
Its government has yet to announce its position, but a spokesman hinted that a delay may be appropriate.
""There's a general consensus from multiple sectors in the region about the importance of a Latin American figure leading such an important organization as the IDB,"" the spokesman said.
""Rushing a decision on the matter would not be prudent.""
Costa Rica's foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday that delaying the election would be ""a timely and convenient option"" to strengthen the bank.
The U.S. presidential election on Nov.3 could see Trump losing to Democratic candidate Joe Biden, who has opposed Claver-Carone's bid to lead the bank.
A Cuban-American, Claver-Carone told Reuters last month that he had ""overwhelming support"" for his bid from countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. He said 15 countries had publicly supported him and six other had expressed their backing privately.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Lebanon's economy, already sinking before the explosion that knocked out its main port, could now shrink by double the rate previously forecast for this year, making it even harder to secure the financing the country needs to get back on its feet.
Economists say Tuesday's blast, which also damaged large parts of commercial Beirut, could lead to a GDP contraction of around 20-25% this year - far beyond the IMF's recent forecast for a 12% decline due to a deepening economic and political crisis.
Lebanese officials have estimated losses due to the blast, which killed 150 people, left thousands injured and rendered tens of thousands homeless, could run into billions of dollars.
A financial crisis had already led Lebanon to enter negotiations with the International Monetary Fund in May this year after it defaulted on its foreign currency debt, but those talks were put on hold in the absence of reforms.
Analysts say the blast highlights negligence in Lebanon's governance and puts more pressure on the government to speed up reforms in order to access aid to rebuild the economy.
While there has been an outpouring of sympathy for the country this week, there has been a notable absence of aid commitments so far, beyond urgent humanitarian aid.
""If reforms are not carried out, Lebanon will continue to sink,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday as he toured the devastation in Beirut port.
Gulf states, which once helped Lebanon, meanwhile have baulked at bailing out a country where Iran-backed Hezbollah is powerful.
""It’s highly unlikely that Lebanon will be able to unlock the financing that it needs to overcome its fundamental economic problems. Some partners may be reluctant to provide support given the influential role of Iran-backed Hezbollah in the Lebanese government,"" said Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist Capital Economics.
Lebanon's financial crisis came to a head last October as capital inflows slowed down and protests erupted over corruption and bad governance, with a hard currency liquidity crunch leading banks to impose tight curbs on cash withdrawals and transfers abroad. 
The blast has put renewed pressure on the Lebanese pound, which was trading at around 8,300 per dollar on the black market after the explosion, against a level of 8,000 beforehand, dealers say.
Economists predict more erosion in the purchasing power of the pound, which has lost nearly 80% of its value since October with skyrocketing inflation topping 56%, accentuating social tensions.
The most urgent reforms that need to be implemented to restart talks with the IMF include tackling a runaway budget, mounting debt and endemic corruption, economists say.
""We think the explosion could delay the reform process as the government tries to deflect blame, eating up the political capital necessary for difficult but urgently needed reforms,"" said Patrick Curran, senior economist at Tellimer, a UK based research firm. 
Businessmen and economists say the port - one of the biggest in the eastern Mediterranean and where over 40% of transshipments went to Syria and the Middle East region - has already lost revenues and business since the blast to other rival ports as shipping lines divert transit cargo. 
""The port turned out to be (Lebanon's) weakness,"" said Jawad Anani, a regional economic consultant and former Jordanian minister. ""There was so much dependence on it, so when it was demolished it turned out to be their Achilles heel.""
David Sabella, who opened an Italian restaurant and bar, ‘Spicy No7', 18 months ago in Gemmayze close to the port area, saw them both destroyed by the blast. 
""The government should have some mercy on us. I have nothing now,"" he said.
Rising political tensions since the explosion will only make things worse and complicate efforts to speed reforms, pushing the country into uncharted territory.

""It's a bleak outlook with infighting among a political class that lacks consensus on a way out and is unwilling to swallow the bitter pill,"" said Kamal Hamdan, director of Beirut-based Consultation and Research Institute (CRI).

ROME (Reuters) - Italy approved on Friday a new stimulus package aimed at helping businesses and families survive the coronavirus crisis, while Rome waits to receive funds from the European Union's Recovery Fund.
The government would use the extra spending, worth 25 billion euros ($29.5 billion), to soften the blow to an economy ravaged by lockdown measures imposed to stem the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed almost 35,200 people.
Italy hopes to front-load this year part of 209 billion euros in grants and cheap loans it should receive from the Recovery Fund starting in 2021. The Italian economy has been among the worst hit by the crisis, facing an 11.2% contraction this year, according to European Union estimates, the sharpest fall in the 27-nation bloc.
""We have set aside 12 billion euros to support employment,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told reporters after a three-hour Cabinet meeting.
Part of the borrowing will be used to conditionally extend temporary layoff schemes for up to 18 weeks, with firms required not to cut jobs to qualify for state aid.
Companies less affected by the crisis will have to pay a contribution to apply for aid covering a period which exceeds the first nine weeks, a draft decree seen by Reuters showed.
With some 12.6 million Italian workers on furlough and facing the end of support, extending the scheme was seen as essential to avoid an immediate crisis for households and consumer spending.
Among other measures, the decree extends until January a moratorium on repayments for loans to small and medium-sized businesses and funds a four-month cut in pension contributions paid by companies on behalf of new permanent hires.
Companies based in the poorest regions in the South will benefit from a 30% cut in pension contributions for all workers, not just new hires.
The draft authorises the government to spend up to 1.5 billion euros this year to participate in capital increases at state-controlled companies. An additional 500 million euros will go to boost incentives for state-of-the-art combustion engine cars as well as electric and hybrid vehicles.

The stimulus will drive the 2020 budget deficit to 11.9% of national output, versus a goal of 10.4% set in April, while public debt is set to rise to 157.6% of GDP.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) on Friday said the agency faces a ""dire"" financial position even as it posted a slightly narrower third-quarter loss as package demand soared during the coronavirus pandemic.
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said USPS has a ""broken business model... Without dramatic change, there is no end in sight and we face an impending liquidity crisis,"" he said.
Later Friday, DeJoy said USPS has implemented a management hiring freeze and is seeking approval for early retirement offers for non-union employees.
He also announced he is reorganizing USPS into three business operating units. He added the organizational changes ""do not initiate a reduction-in-force.""
USPS said quarterly revenue rose to $17.6 billion, up $547 million. The quarterly net loss shrank to $2.2 billion from $2.3 billion in the same quarter last year.
First-class mail volume declined by 1.1 billion pieces, or 8.4%. Shipping and packages revenue increased by $2.9 billion, or 53.6%, on a volume increase of 708 million pieces, up 49.9%.
Democrats in Congress Friday, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Gary Peters and Tom Carper asked the USPS inspector general to probe changes made during DeJoy's tenure that they say have slowed deliveries and could threaten 2020 ballot deliveries.
Voting by mail is expected to increase dramatically this fall due to the coronavirus pandemic. Trump has claimed without evidence that absentee voting leads to rampant fraud.
""We are not slowing down election mail or any other mail,"" DeJoy, a Trump supporter, said Friday at a USPS board meeting. 
""The notion that I would ever make decisions concerning the Postal Service at the direction of the president or anyone else is wholly off base,"" he added.
The Postal Service has faced financial woes with the rise of email and social media, and a measure passed in 2006 requiring it to prefund 75 years of retiree health benefits over the span of 10 years at a cost of more than $100 billion. 
The Postal Service has lost $80 billion since 2007.

On Friday, the National Association of Letter Carriers said it filed a union grievance over a new USPS delivery test initiative that imposes restrictions on letter carriers' morning duties.

(Reuters) - A key Federal Reserve official told a congressional watchdog on Friday that participation in a $600 billion loan program meant to carry small and medium-sized firms through the coronavirus crisis would expand rapidly if the pandemic or economy worsened.
American businesses have tapped only a fraction of the funds available through the Main Street Lending Program launched by the U.S. central bank last month, spurring criticism the program was too restrictive and set up too late to help employers.
""Should the pandemic and the economy worsen, or financial institutions experience larger-than-expected loan losses and depletion of capital – all things we hope do not happen – then I would expect interest in using this program to expand more rapidly,"" Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said in testimony before the Congressional Oversight Commission, a bipartisan panel overseeing efforts by the Fed and Treasury Department to stabilize the economy during the crisis. 
The Boston Fed is administering the Main Street program.
More than $530 million in potential loans were active in the Main Street portal as of Aug. 4, representing 54 loans, Rosengren said. That includes $109 million in loans that have been settled with commitments for purchase, he said.
But some members of the commission, which includes two Republican lawmakers, a Democratic lawmaker and a Democratic political advisor, said businesses are already suffering, raising questions about whether the parameters of the program were too restrictive.
""Main street companies are already getting crushed,"" said Bharat Ramamurti, an attorney and former economic policy adviser for Senator Elizabeth Warren's 2020 presidential campaign. Ramamurti cited surveys showing that companies are going ahead with layoffs and furloughs after suffering large drops in revenue.
""How much worse do things have to get before companies are interested in the Main Street Lending Program,"" Ramamurti said. 
The Fed this week disclosed details on some of the specific loans issued through the program, under which it will buy 95% of a loan initiated by a private lender to a qualified business. The largest loan so far, worth $50 million, went to a resort in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, the Fed said. The next largest was the program's first-ever loan, $12.3 million to a dental practice network in Wisconsin.

Since registration opened in mid-June, 509 financial institutions have signed up with the Main Street Lending Program, Rosengren said. Only 153 lenders were willing to be part of a list on the Boston Fed's website https://www.bostonfed.org/supervision-and-regulation/supervision/special-facilities/main-street-lending-program.aspx of lenders that are accepting new borrowers through the program.

LONDON (Reuters) - Insured losses from the Beirut port warehouse explosion are likely to total around $3 billion, similar to those from an explosion at the Chinese port of Tianjin in 2015, industry sources and analysts say.
The blast on Tuesday, the biggest in Beirut's history, killed 154 people, destroyed a swathe of the city and sent seismic shockwaves around the region.
Officials have said the blast might have caused economic losses of $15 billion.
Much of these would not have been insured.
However, Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) estimated the insured losses for explosions at a warehouse in Tianjin, which killed at least 116 people, at between $2.5 and $3.5 billion. 
""Drawing a comparison with Tianjin, you will see significant insured losses,"" said Ghislain Le Cam, director, analytics at AM Best.
An insurance source, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, estimated the insured losses for the Beirut explosion at around $2-$3 billion.
That includes claims by the port itself for property damage and business interruption, which could total the ""low hundreds of millions"" of dollars.
Munich Re said this week the explosion would likely result in big claims, but it could not yet give an estimate.
AXA and Allianz (DE:ALVG), two major international insurers operating in Lebanon, also said it was too soon to give any figures.
Losses were high in Tianjin partly because of the value of thousands of imported cars stored at the port.
In Beirut, the blast destroyed Lebanon's only large grain silo. Lebanon, a nation of an estimated 6 million people, imports almost all of its wheat.
While losses related to goods stored at the Beirut port would likely be lower than in Tianjin, they would still be substantial, a second source said, requesting anonymity.

But the Beirut explosion also destroyed residential and commercial property, including restaurants and hotels, which sources said would likely make up the bulk of the insurance claims.

""We agreed to accelerate talks with an aim of reaching an outline agreement by the end of August,"" Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, who is in London for the talks, told reporters in an online briefing.
British trade minister Liz Truss said negotiations, which began in June, had been positive and productive.
""We have reached consensus on the major elements of a deal, including ambitious provisions in areas like digital, data and financial services that go significantly beyond the EU-Japan deal,"" she said in a statement.

Japan is a major investor in British industry, particularly consumer electronics and car manufacturing. 
The total value of bilateral trade in 2019 was 31.6 billion pounds ($41 billion) according to British data, a figure London hopes to increase by about 15 billion pounds a year in the long run.

In a report containing its first forecast for 2020, the French farm ministry on Friday projected output at 44.7-45.7 million hectolitres, a rise of 6-8% compared with last year and slightly above the country's average of the past five years.
A hectolitre is the equivalent of 100 litres, or 133 standard wine bottles.
Vines generally benefited from favourable spring weather for flowering, although mildew disease has affected parts of the southwest and hailstorms in the Bordeaux region caused up to 30% production losses in some zones, the ministry said.
A developing drought in France could curb the anticipated increase in production this year, it added.
A very warm spring has left vines much further ahead in their growth than last year, with the Loire Valley region showing an advance of up to one month, it said.
The prospect of an early wine grape harvest has added to headaches for growers reliant on seasonal labour and who have been facing a shortfall of foreign workers and stricter sanitary measures during the novel coronavirus epidemic.
For the Champagne region, the ministry said vines were showing good potential, but noted that producers have yet to agree on an annual volume.

Growers and champagne houses are negotiating a production target, with some producers looking to cut output to shore up prices of the sparkling wine after the coronavirus crisis slashed sales.

1314,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>",Lebanon's investors wary as blast upends debt revamp plans,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Lebanon's creditors are wary of the risk of even steeper losses as a devastating blast in Beirut complicates an already stalled debt restructuring process. 
Even before Tuesday's explosion in Beirut's port that killed 154 people, progress had been slow on a turnaround from deep financial turmoil that culminated in a default on Lebanon's foreign currency debt in March.
Reflecting the gloomy outlook, the country's $31 billion of sovereign dollar-bonds, beset by thin liquidity since the default, have sunk generally deeper below 20 cents in the dollar since March.
This has further diminished prospects of recovery for creditors already facing wider losses than for Argentina and Ecuador, two other troubled sovereigns which both moved closer to finalizing their own debt revamps this week.
Trading volumes on Lebanese bonds spiked to their highest in three weeks on Wednesday, according to MarketAxess data, with financial sources citing a push by some creditors to try to sell their holdings.
""It means Lebanon is more likely to see goodwill from the international community but we don't know how this dynamic will play out and what it means for the reform program,"" said Steffen Reichold, portfolio manager at ‎Stone Harbor Investment Partners, which holds some Lebanese Eurobonds.
""In terms of recovery values, it's not going to be positive. If anything, it will be negative.
""But the main determinant is the cold hard facts on the balance sheets of the various institutions involved - the government, BdL (central bank) and the local banks - and that's what will drive recoveries.""
With Lebanon's economy expected to face a more severe economic dip this year in the wake of the blast, investors are pondering the scale of revisions that may be required to the government's debt sustainability metrics laid out in an existing rescue plan, as the parallel exchange rate weakens further and government costs rise.
""The prospects are even worse than before,"" said a foreign creditor who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""This episode underlines how weak the state of governance is in Lebanon.""
Even before the blast, the process of overhauling the debt had hardly begun, with the government's financial adviser Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) yet to engage comprehensively with creditors as talks with the International Monetary Fund over financing were put on hold.
Lebanon's commercial banks, the single largest constituency of Eurobond holders, had raised concerns about the government's plan.
Tuesday's explosion was a ""watershed event"" that could change the political system for the better, said an adviser to the banks association who asked to remain anonymous.

The adviser also warned that if the existing, long-ruling political class hangs on to power, the economic costs of the blast could lead to lower recovery values.

1315,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 10:20AM ET</span>",Take Five: We're all going on a summer holiday (maybe),"1/WANTED: AUGUST LIFELINE FOR TOURISM
August conjures up images of beaches and sunshine but it may not bring much respite to travel and tourism stocks. Battered by lockdowns, tourism has lagged a broader market recovery, with airline, hotel and leisure shares 20%-50% lower year-to-date.
After an uptick since the start of August - Europe's travel and leisure index has risen 7% - the lifting of a U.S. advisory against foreign travel and initiatives, such as Spain's offer to cover travellers' health costs, could provide some support. 
But more is at stake than share prices - shrinking tourism may shave 3%-11% off countries' GDP. And as stricken airlines and hotels lay off staff, mass unemployment is a potent threat.

2/BUY EVERYTHING!(?) 
We will soon learn if the ""buy everything"" trade has legs. 
The U.S. Congress' dithering over approving more stimulus has pushed gold to record highs above $2,000 while U.S. Treasury yields have lurched lower. But equities too are riding high - clearly the powerful backstop of central bank stimulus is holding firm. 
The rush for everything - risk as well as safety - has lingered. But positioning on most markets is stretched and such good news as there is, from earnings to vaccine trials, seems priced in. Upcoming data, election news plus Sino-U.S. trade talks might show the difficulties of having one's cake and eating it.
Graphic - FOMO? The buy everything trade holds sway: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbpgbdgxvq/theme0608.png
3/LOOKING INTO THE FUTURES 
The U.S. election has yet to have much traction on markets, but that may change soon. Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden will announce a running mate before the Aug. 17 Democratic convention. President Donald Trump meanwhile is intensifying his campaign against mail-in voting, which he says encourages fraud. 
Some investors are moving to hedge portfolios against volatility around the Nov. 3 election. That shows up in futures on the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) <0#VX:>, which shows a bump in expectations for market swings around then.
The implied volatility rise looks especially steep, given the VIX itself has eased to 5-month lows. The spread between August  and October  VIX futures is at 5.5 points, the widest since the contracts began trading.
The focus may be less on the outcome and more on possible delays in tallying results, due to the widespread use of mail ballots this year. Volatility and legal challenges remain risks.

4/TURKEY'S TIGHTENING TRICKS
Turkey's central bank is acting to limit the lira's plunge, using backdoor tools that bankers estimate could tighten policy by up to 300 basis points.
But tricks, such as changing the composition of funding, only buy time. Previous crises suggest only big interest rate hikes are effective. That's what markets are betting on.
When and how the central bank acts bear watching. More lira weakness will worsen inflation, and compromise companies' ability to repay external debt. And if citizens' confidence in the lira and local banks evaporates, authorities will be powerless to stop a currency collapse.

5/MONEY TALKSBob Lighthizer and Liu He will have some catching up to do on Aug 15, when they dial into a video conference to review the U.S.-China trade deal. 
The review coincides with deteriorating ties. Following Mike Pompeo's combative speech and tit-for-tat consulate closures, Chinese tech firms TikTok and Tencent are in Trump's crosshairs. A planned health secretary visit to Taiwan is raising Beijing's hackles. So far the markets remain confident in the trade relationship. But Beijing is behind on purchase targets for U.S. goods and its surplus with the United States rose by 10% last month. The yuan  has backed off five-month peaks ahead of what may prove an awkward video conference.

1317,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>",UK says it's confident of Brexit trade deal as EU changing tone,"By Guy Faulconbridge and Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's top minister overseeing Brexit talks said on Friday he was confident a free trade deal would be clinched with the European Union as there had been a distinct change of tone from the bloc in recent weeks allowing progress to be made.
The United Kingdom left the EU on Jan. 31 but the main terms of its membership remain in place - including being in the EU customs union and single market - during a transition period until the end of this year, during which time both sides hope to negotiate a new free trade accord.
""I'm confident that there will be a deal, I think there has been a welcome change in tone over the last few weeks,"" Michael Gove told reporters in Portadown in the British province of Northern Ireland.
""The omens are good for a deal. Now of course there is some tough talking to do,"" Gove said. ""I believe that there will be a successful negotiated outcome.""
While Britain has always said it believed a deal was possible, the tenor of the comments from Gove - one of the most senior Brexit supporters in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government - was distinctly more positive than in recent months.
In late May, for example, Gove was demanding that the EU break the impasse in talks. 
Failure to reach a deal would convulse global trade just as the world comes to terms with the economic destruction sown by the novel coronavirus. 
The EU is willing to compromise by softening its demand that Britain heed the bloc's rules on state aid in the future, diplomatic sources told Reuters earlier this month.
They said Brussels could go for a compromise entailing a dispute-settling mechanism on any state aid granted by the UK to its companies in the future, rather than obliging London to follow the bloc’s own fair-competition rules from the outset.
""The relationship that we have with the European Union is constructive, pragmatic and impressive,"" Gove said, adding that he thought a deal could be done though there was more work to do.

Britain and the EU have planned more trade negotiations all the way until Oct. 2, less than a fortnight before a summit where the bloc hopes to endorse any agreement with London.

1318,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 09:18AM ET</span>",Schools Face Billions in Bills to Shield U.S. Kids from Pandemic,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. public schools are stockpiling masks, hand sanitizer and plexiglass shields, racking up bills that could top $100 billion to protect children who study in actual classrooms this fall or help them learn from home.
The Dallas Independent School District, which is scheduled to open Sept. 8, has already spent $20 million on those items and protective equipment, and estimates a $50 million cost to install home internet for all students so they can log in from home.
Factor in costs such as hazard pay, and its total pandemic-protection tab may surpass $200 million. Michael Hinojosa, superintendent of the fifth-largest urban district, says it’s especially challenging because of conflicting advice from politicians and health experts.
“We deal with people’s two most prized possessions: their money and their kids,” Hinojosa said. “And they expect us to have answers. But when we keep getting mixed messages and different information we have to make different decisions.”
It will cost the average U.S. district an estimated $1.77 million in new disinfecting expenses, cleaning equipment and additional staff to be able to reopen in-person schools, according to the Association of School Business Officials International and the School Superintendents Association.
The extra expense comes to about $490 per pupil. Even if many systems, such as Chicago and Los Angeles go remote, the costs will be staggering, considering that America educates more than 50 million public school children. All told, the American Federation of Teachers estimates that safely opening in the pandemic could cost districts an extra $116.5 billion.
Controlling the spread of the virus in schools adds up in many ways. Schools are instituting staggered classroom changes, hand sanitizer stations throughout buildings, masks, temperature checks, one-way hallways and pre-packaged lunches, rather than buffet-style dining. Social distancing on buses means each one can carry fewer children and routes must be run more often.
Schools are buying electrostatic disinfectant sprayers to clean large spaces and surfaces. Orders for sprayers can take 12 weeks, or longer, to arrive, according to Sharie Lewis, director of business services & operations at Parkrose School District in Portland, Oregon. Schools are hiring more mental-health counselors, nurses and custodial staff.
To help cover virus-related expenses, Congress directed $13.2 billion to K-12 schools. But districts will need even more as states face declining revenue because of widespread shutdowns. State and city sales-tax collections fell by 12% in the second quarter, the steepest drop since 1958, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.
Then, there’s the cost of not opening schools. Single parents, workers who can’t do their jobs at home and parents with young children may account for about 24 million workers, or 15% of the labor force, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economists wrote in an Aug. 2 note. Education-sector shutdowns accounted for a 2.2 percentage point decline in annualized real gross domestic product growth in the second quarter.
“This is a national emergency,” said David Lewis, executive director of the Association of School Business Officials. “We’re keeping the economy going, but we’ve got to control the virus, then start looking at schools and then start looking at businesses. Without those three things in that order, we’re just going to keep stopping and starting and doing this all over again.”
So administrators often are opening up nearly empty wallets. In Tampa, Florida, the Hillsborough County Public Schools, which start Aug. 24 with four weeks of virtual learning, figure that steam-cleaning buses and buying disposable masks, disinfecting wipes and other supplies will cost about $5 million a month.
Parkrose School District estimates it may spend as much as $900,000 on cleaning supplies this year, Lewis said. It has already paid out $411,000 on Chrome books for students to learn at home, cutting its reserves almost in half.
“Everybody in the country in school districts are using chrome books,” she said. “So the commodity is high. High, high, high.”

1320,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday, August 7th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The U.S. labor market report for July is due, with job gains expected to slow sharply from June's level. President Trump ratchets up the pressure on TikTok owner ByteDance and on squabbling lawmakers as the deadline for a new coronavirus relief bill draws closer. Uber (NYSE:UBER)'s losses widened sharply in the second quarter, and Europe's V-shaped recovery still looks intact for now. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday. August 7th. 
1. Job growth set to slow sharply
The U.S. releases its official labor market report for July, amid expectations that net job creation slowed sharply as a number of key states such as California, Texas and Florida all froze or partially reversed their reopening measures during the month.
The consensus forecast is for a net rise of 1.60 million in nonfarm payrolls, down from the record-high 4.80 million in June. The evidence of ADP’s payrolls number on Wednesday suggests a high risk of revisions to the June number.
Economists point out that the employment numbers are likely to be inflated by the statistical process of seasonal adjustment.
“It will adjust for the fact that some workers lose their jobs over the summer, by adding some jobs that don’t really exist,” UBS Global Wealth Management chief economist Paul Donovan said in a morning briefing. “That’s a sensible approach, normally. However, jobs that would normally be lost over the summer were actually lost several months ago, so the seasonal adjustment process will be adjusting for a change that doesn’t exist.”
2. Trump cracks down on TikTok, WeChat
President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning U.S. residents from transacting with video service TikTok and its owner Bytedance, citing concerns about the security of U.S. users’ data.
Trump also issued a similar ban on Chinese messaging app WeChat, but didn’t extend the ban to the app’s U.S.-listed owner, Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY). That didn’t stop Tencent’s stock falling by 5.0% in Hong Kong.
U.S. citizens have 45 days to comply with the ban. The Chinese English-language news site Global Times labelled the move “a shameless act of hegemony.”
Coincidentally, China’s trade surplus - the initial cause of Trump’s hostility to the country and its companies - surged in July to its second-highest monthly total ever, as exports recovered while the price and volume of energy imports stayed at depressed levels.
3. Stocks set to open mostly lower ahead of jobs report; Uber's losses widen
U.S. stock markets are indicated to open lower Thursday, as index futures consolidate ahead of the labor market report, against a backdrop of ongoing uncertainty over the next coronavirus relief package for the economy.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow 30 futures contract was down 130 points or 0.5%, while the S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures contracts were down in parallel.
Stocks likely to be in focus in early trading include Uber, whose underlying loss widened in sharply in the second quarter as ride volumes collapsed by 75% year-on-year. Revenue was sustained by its food delivery business Uber Eats, where bookings more than doubled – albeit without generating any profit for the company. CEO Dara Khosroshahi repeated his target of breaking even at an adjusted EBITDA level by the end of next year.
4. Deadline draws near for stimulus package
The fate of the next coronavirus relief bill is still hanging in the balance, after Democrats and Republicans failed to make any real headway on talks ahead of their self-imposed deadline of the end of the week.
““We’re still a considerable amount apart in terms of a compromise that could be signed into law,” White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters after a meeting with Democratic Party leaders.
President Trump has said he may use executive actions to extend the flow of jobless benefits, and a partial moratorium on evictions. He is also sticking with the idea of suspending payroll taxes, although lawmakers on both sides have warned the measure will be ineffective.
5. Europe's recovery still intact
Europe’s V-shaped recovery story gained a bit more credence with stronger-than-expected rebounds in industrial production in Germany, France and Spain in June.
The figures suggest that economic momentum picked up markedly toward the end of the quarter, as lockdown measures were lifted and factories – especially in the auto sector – resumed production.
In the U.K. meanwhile, house prices broke a four-month losing streak with a 1.7% gain in July, according to mortgage lender Halifax. The country’s biggest online real estate agent, Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY), said customer traffic to its site had broken records on 65 of the 81 days since the government announced the relaxation of lockdown measures and a temporary waiver of stamp duty on home sales."

1322,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 04:50AM ET</span>",China's new yuan loans expected to fall in July: Reuters poll,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's new bank loans are expected to fall in July after record lending in the first half of the year, but are still likely to be higher than a year earlier, amid sustained policy support to get the economy on a solid footing after the coronavirus.
Chinese banks are estimated to have issued 1.20 trillion yuan ($172.26 billion) in net new yuan loans last month, compared with 1.81 trillion yuan in June, according to the median estimate in a Reuters survey of 27 economists.
That would still be higher than 1.06 trillion yuan in credit a year earlier.
The central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), said on Thursday it would make its prudent monetary policy more flexible and targeted, and keep liquidity appropriately ample to support economic recovery.
Central bank adviser Ma Jun said in remarks published this week that there was no need to step up monetary policy easing as a recovery was well underway.
China dropped its annual growth target this year for the first time since 2002 and pledged more government spending to help revive the world's second-biggest economy.
The PBOC has already rolled out a raft of easing steps since early February, including bank reserve-requirement cuts and targeted lending support for virus-hit firms. 
Broad M2 money supply growth in July was seen at 11.1%, the same as growth the previous month.
Annual outstanding yuan loans were expected to grow 13.2% for July, the same as for June.
Authorities have been leaning more heavily on fiscal stimulus to weather the downturn, cutting taxes and issuing local government bonds to fund infrastructure projects. 
The government is targeting a 2020 budget deficit of at least 3.6% of gross domestic product, higher than last year's 2.8%, and fixed the quota on local-government special bond issues at 3.75 trillion yuan, up from 2.15 trillion yuan.
New local government special bond issues totalled 2.27 trillion yuan by end-July, accounting for 60.4% of the year's quota, the finance ministry said on Tuesday.
Local governments should aim to complete the issue of special bonds by end-October.
The government finished issuing 1 trillion yuan in special treasury bonds by the end of July to help cope with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the finance ministry said this week.
Any acceleration in government bond issuing could help boost total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity.

In July, TSF was expected to have fallen to 1.85 trillion yuan from 3.43 trillion yuan in June.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 04:10AM ET</span>","Extending UK furlough would trap people in false hope, finance minister says","By Andy Bruce and Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Extending Britain's furlough scheme would leave some workers trapped in false hope that they could return to their jobs after the coronavirus pandemic, British finance minister Rishi Sunak said on Friday.
With redundancies mounting, opposition politicians and think tanks have said Sunak should extend the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme - due to expire at the end of October - until the economy is strong enough to support more at-risk workers.
Sunak has said there is no question of a wholesale extension of the programme and he was backed up by Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey on Thursday.
""It's wrong to keep people trapped in a situation and pretend that there is always a job that they can go back to,"" Sunak told BBC Radio Scotland.
He said the government had taken action to provide people with new opportunities, including apprenticeships and training during what ""is unquestionably going to be a difficult time"".
Last week the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a major think tank, said closing the furlough scheme early would be a ""mistake"" that would cause surging unemployment.
Extending the scheme would largely pay for itself by averting job cuts, NIESR said.
The BoE said it estimated 7.5 million workers had benefited from the furlough scheme at its peak, and that 4 million had now returned to work, while 3.5 million were still on furlough.
Governor Bailey said on Thursday that some parts of the economy would no longer be viable once the fallout of the pandemic clears - with hospitality and leisure looking especially vulnerable.
LAY-OFFS SURGING
Major British companies have already announced tens of thousands of redundancies.
Bailey said on Thursday that the central bank's projection for an unemployment rate of 7.5% this year was a ""very bad story"" for the British public, and warned that it could turn out worse than that.
Sunak told Times Radio that Britain cannot sustain the level of borrowing it has undertaken to support the economy through the pandemic and warned of difficult decisions ahead.
""The appropriate thing is to be bold and decisive in the response and try and protect as much of the economic capacity we have as possible. We can borrow this year to do that,"" Sunak said.

""That's not something we can or should sustain.""

1328,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 12:40AM ET</span>","New Zealand central bank seen holding rates, may expand easing: Reuters poll","By Praveen Menon
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank is likely to hold rates steady at its policy meeting on Wednesday amid signs of improvement in the economy, and is expected to lay out its plans for future policy action to soften the impact from the pandemic.
All 13 economists polled by Reuters predict the official cash rate (OCR) will remain unchanged at 0.25% this year, and just three see rates dropping into negative territory in 2021.
New Zealand shocked markets with a 75 basis point cut in March as the coronavirus surfaced in the country, but has left it unchanged since, with the health crisis quickly controlled and restrictions on the economy were lifted.
Markets expect the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) to stick to a dovish tone by expanding quantitative easing (QE) beyond the current NZ$60 billion ($40.13 billion) and keep alternative monetary policy tools, including negative rates, firmly on the table.
""We expect that an expansion of the current QE programme will remain the RBNZ's first choice for providing stimulus at the August Monetary Policy Statement, given that it is effective with the least costs,"" said ANZ Senior Economist Liz Kendall. 
""But the RBNZ's sentiment suggests they are willing to do much more beyond QE if required,"" she said, adding that QE could be increased to NZ$90 billion over 18 months.
RBNZ promised to outline its readiness to deploy alternative monetary policy tools in its August statement. Any indication that negative rates is its preferred next step could step up pressure on the kiwi dollar.
Recent data had indicated that the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic was not as dire as forecasted, with unemployment rates falling, inflation picking up and the housing market being resilient.
Business confidence also improved as a hard and early response by the government had kept coronavirus infections out of the community and allowed businesses to return.
But unknowns remain, with the borders still shut, hurting New Zealand's large tourism industry, and fears of a second wave of cases looming. The government expects the unemployment rate to rise in the coming months.

""Given the massive uncertainties inherent in any forecast at present, there really isn't a compelling reason to change the stance of monetary policy,"" said Westpac Chief Economist Dominick Stephens.

1329,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 11:55PM ET</span>",Cuba to scrap 'too restrictive' private-sector activities list as economic pressures grow,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba's Communist government said late on Thursday it would scrap a list that sets out a tight definition of business activities permitted in the island nation's fledgling private sector, a move seen boosting self-employment, small firms and start-ups.
The move follows a string of measures loosening restrictions on the private sector over the past month as the government turns to limited reforms to tackle an economic crisis in the wake of key ally Venezuela's implosion, increased U.S. sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic.
Labor Minister Marta Elena Feito said during a televised roundtable that the pandemic had proven the list was too restrictive, citing unauthorized production of personal protective equipment by private sector workers.
Cuban economists and private sector backers welcomed the move, but said much would depend on implementation. Cubans must still apply for a license to work in the private sector, giving authorities a high degree of discretion over what is allowed.
""This has surprised me! It's good news and something we have been asking for years,"" said Camilo Condis, an entrepreneur and host of popular podcast ""El Enjambre"" (""The Swarm""), in a post on Twitter. ""Now it remains to be seen how and when they will implement this.""
Cuba has opened centrally planned economy to the private sector in fits and starts since the 1990s, weighing up the need to stimulate lackluster growth with concerns over rising inequality in incomes and the loss of state control.
In recent years it had backtracked on some market-style reforms as those concerns gained the upper hand.

But measures adopted over the past month include the opening of a wholesale outlet in the capital to private eateries for the first time and the authorization for small private businesses to import and export, albeit through state companies.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Nearly half the workers at private firms in Australia's Victoria state, around 1.5 million people, will receive a federal wage subsidy as a surge of coronavirus cases forces a near total lockdown in the state, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Friday. 
The figure illustrates the economic pain of a six-week lockdown of Melbourne, the capital of Victoria and the country's second largest city, which will see shops and businesses shuttered and five million inhabitants required to stay home.
With Australia making it easier to qualify for wage subsidies, Frydenberg said half of the private sector labour force in Victoria will receive a two-weekly payment of A$1,500 ($1,085), a programme known as JobKeeper.
Australia's wage subsidy scheme, which is scheduled to run until March 2021 and cost more than A$32.4 billion, is among measures seeking to prop up the economy, which is entering its first recession in nearly three decades.
""It's heartbreaking, it's very challenging but unless we drive down movement, the number of people moving around Victoria, we don't drive down the number of coronavirus cases, and then we will remain in these terrible conditions,"" Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters in Melbourne.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said unemployment was forecast to peak at 10%, with effective unemployment closer to 14% when counting workers in the wage subsidy scheme.
But authorities say the lockdown of Melbourne is the only way to contain the second wave outbreak of COVID-19 which has infected thousands in recent weeks.
Victoria, the country's second most populous state, reported on Friday 450 new COVID-19 cases and 11 deaths in the previous 24 hours. Victoria has nearly 8,000 active COVID-19 cases.
""Having seen stabilisation in numbers, that's a positive. We do expect, within 14 days of a really significant intervention, that we'll see a change in numbers,"" Victoria state's Chief Medical Officer Brett Sutton told reporters in Melbourne.
Australia has reported just over 20,000 cases of the virus, of which Victoria has reported 13,400. Nationwide, deaths total 266, still far fewer than many other developed nations.
But authorities worry that the outbreak in Victoria could spur a nationwide second wave despite stringent restrictions on cross border travel.
Australia's most populous state New South Wales (NSW), the second worst hit by coronavirus, said on Friday it had found 11 new cases in the last 24 hours, with particular concern around a case in Newcastle, the state's second largest city. NSW has just over 800 active infections.
A third person from a family in Newcastle has been diagnosed with COVID-19, and authorities said they are still unsure how they cluster contracted the virus.
Authorities also warned patrons from five pubs in the area to self-isolate after the man in his 20s visited a string of venues while potentially infectious.

While Queensland state, which did not report any new cases on Friday, will close its border with NSW on Saturday, after already banning residents from Victoria.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank downgraded its outlook for the national economy on Friday and warned unemployment would stay high for several years as a second wave of coronavirus infections sent the city of Melbourne back into an extended lockdown.
Australia is facing its deepest contraction in about a century driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, though the economic shock has been less severe than first forecast.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) expects annual gross domestic product (GDP) to contract by 6% this year and then slowly recover over the next couple of years.
However, this recovery is now likely to be more protracted than first thought, with Melbourne in a total lockdown following a relentless surge in COVID-19 cases since June, RBA Assistant Governor Luci Ellis said during a webcast.
""The large persistent rise in case numbers in Victoria and the ensuing introduction of Stage Four restrictions there were not anticipated,"" Ellis said in a speech after the release of the RBA's quarterly economic outlook.
""This is not exactly a lesson for our earlier forecasts, but it does show how quickly things can change in a pandemic.""
Victoria state, of which Melbourne is the capital city, accounts for 30% of Australia's national output.
The RBA expects the latest containment measures to subtract at least 2 percentage points from national growth in the current quarter.
The RBA forecast growth to pick up next year though the pace will be slower than first hoped.
The economy is seen expanding by 4% next year, down sharply from the RBA's earlier prediction of 7%. The RBA, on Friday, forecast GDP growth of 4% in 2022, lower than its previous projection of 5%.
""The recovery is expected to be slow and uneven, and GDP will probably take several years to return to the trend path expected prior to the virus outbreak,"" Ellis said.
The dour outlook means the RBA would maintain its ""accommodative approach"" for as long as required, after slashing interest rates to a record low of 0.25% in an emergency meeting in March.
Australia is in a technical recession - defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction - for the first time since the early 1990s, having come out of the 2008/09 global financial crisis relatively unscathed.
A massive contraction in demand represents an ""enormous shock"" to the labour market, Ellis said.

""We expect that employment and total hours worked will decline over the next few months, partly because of the increased activity restrictions in Victoria,"" Ellis said.

1332,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 11:25PM ET</span>",Steep discounts for Hong Kong foreclosed homes may portend property price slump,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Some Hong Kong foreclosed homes have been recently sold at steep discounts, adding to signs that the world's most expensive housing market could be heading for price declines both this year and next.
With the economy hit by anti-government protests and the coronavirus pandemic, foreclosures in the Asian financial hub jumped 54% in the first seven months of the year to 675, according to property auctioneer Century 21 Surveyors.
Both speculative investors and ordinary people are walking away from their mortgages, financing companies and auctioneers told Reuters. Some warn foreclosures could surge next year to their highest levels since the global financial crisis.
Unlike Hong Kong's commercial property market which has seen a 30% drop in building values in the past year, home prices have so far been relatively resilient due to strong demand, even edging up 1.8% in the first half of this year.
But two foreclosed properties belonging to a mainland Chinese investor recently sold at discounts of 25% and 12% to their respective purchase prices of around HK$30 million ($3.9 million) and HK$20 million, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The person declined to be identified discussing client matters.
Henry Choi, a director at Century 21 Surveyors, also said his company has had three recent cases where banks put auctions on hold after deciding to go back to court to ask for a lower base price.
""The original valuations were too optimistic and they would be hard to sell now in this market,"" he said.
With demand far outstripping supply, prices for Hong Kong private homes have surged more than six times since 2003. There has only been one year of annual decline in that period - a drop of 3.6% in 2016.
Some analysts, however, expect current economic stresses will soon hit the market harder and predict a fall of roughly 5% this year to be followed by a bigger drop next year.
Industry sources also note foreclosures last month were artificially low as courts have been processing cases very slowly for several weeks due to social distancing measures imposed after new outbreaks of the virus.
Choi said he expects foreclosures to spike in the April-June quarter, noting a jump is almost certain due to the end in February of pandemic relief measures introduced by Hong Kong banks that allow home owners to pay only the interest and not the principal of their loans.
He predicts there could be as many as 2,000 foreclosures for all of 2021. That, however, would be lower than the more than 3,600 seen in 2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis, with the current market gaining some relief from monetary easing and low interest rates.
Anticipating lower prices ahead, lenders have also become super keen to offload properties as fast as possible.

""Normally we'd sell through property agents because transaction prices from auctions are too low, but now we want to get rid of the mess quickly so if agents can't sell a property in two months, we put it up for auction,"" said the chairman of a finance company, also declining to be identified.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic leaders in the U.S. Congress and top aides to President Donald Trump failed to make substantial progress on Thursday on a new coronavirus aid bill during a contentious meeting that broke up with no clear path to a deal.
Both sides expressed a willingness to continue negotiations, even as Trump stood by his threat to withdraw from the talks if a deal is not reached soon. Instead, he is considering using executive powers to provide some limited aid.
""If we conclude tomorrow that there's not a compromise position on the major issues, the president has alternatives in executive orders,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters.
""We're still very far apart"" on key issues, he said.
The two sides have failed for almost two weeks to agree on a fresh round of financial stimulus intended to salve the heavy human and economic toll of a pandemic that has killed nearly 160,000 Americans and thrown tens of millions out of work.
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the two sides were very far apart.
Their differences centered around new aid to state and local governments and continuing the additional $600 per week federally-backed unemployment benefits agreed to earlier in the crisis.
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said White House negotiators refused to ""meet in the middle"" during more than three hours of talks.
The Democratic-controlled House in mid-May passed a $3.4 trillion coronavirus aid bill. The Senate has failed to pass even a one-week extension of the $600-per-week jobless benefit that expired last Friday.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell last week unveiled a $1 trillion plan that Democrats dismissed, as did many of his fellow Republicans.
With pressure building on Congress and the White House to respond with a fifth major aid bill this year as coronavirus cases and deaths mount, the negotiators were feeling the pressure, especially as some emergency aid programs expired.
'SLAMMING THE TABLE'
Pelosi said White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, a former right-wing House member, at one point ""slammed the table and walked out"" of the Democratic speaker's office. She compared his behavior to that of Trump's at past White House meetings she attended.
""You're slamming the table on our children and their schools. We need to have substantial help for our schools,"" Pelosi said.
Meadows denied to reporters that he had walked out of the meeting.
For months, congressional Republicans and the White House have bridled at Democrats' demand for around $1 trillion in new aid for state and local governments, saying it was a bailout for fiscal irresponsibility by those governments.
Democrats have countered that state and local governments face devastating layoffs as their revenues have fallen during the coronavirus crisis.
In a shift, Mnuchin said Trump is prepared to help state and local governments with aid that deals with additional coronavirus-related expenses and makes sure first responders, hospitals, police, firemen and school teachers all have ""proper funding.""
He did not indicate how much money the president was willing to spend, but said it could not be a large sum.
The White House, Mnuchin said, offered a compromise on extending federal unemployment benefits and would consider giving aid to renters so that they do not get evicted during the coronavirus pandemic that has hobbled the U.S. economy.
Since the beginning of the negotiations, the two sides have tangled over whether a sweeping economic stimulus was needed, as Democrats have insisted, or whether some targeted funding would suffice.

Deep into the talks, that remained a thorny issue, as Meadows said Trump instructed him and Mnuchin to push the possibility of a ""narrower deal.""

1334,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 08:45PM ET</span>","China Tells Banks, Wealth Fund to Cut Pay as Economy Slumps","(Bloomberg) -- Chinese authorities are doubling down on pressure to get the nation’s biggest state-owned financial groups to reduce salaries in a bid to boost returns as the virus-hit economy faces its slowest expansion in four decades.
Plans for limiting pay have gone out to entities including China’s massive sovereign wealth fund, its biggest bank and investment conglomerate, according to people familiar with the move who asked not to be named revealing private deliberations. The reductions will vary among firms based on a formula, but could reach an average of 30% at some companies, the people said.
Financial firms were first notified of the need to reduce pay last year and given details on how to make those cuts in early 2020, according to the people. Implemented, however, hasn’t been uniform with some institution acting more quickly than others, the people said. More recently, the ministry has begun pushing laggards to act, they said.
The decision could mean more money in government coffers for stimulus and marks another step in forcing its $41 trillion banking system to support the economic recovery even as the pandemic eases. Lenders including Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. have earlier been asked to cap profit growth to single digits, forgoing 1.5 trillion yuan ($200 billion) in earnings this year by offering cheap loans and cutting fees. They have also been told to roll over and defer payments on trillions of yuan in troubled loans to small- and medium-sized businesses.
Among institutions being instructed to adjust salaries are China Investment Corp., the $940 billion sovereign wealth fund, China Development Bank, ICBC, China’s biggest bank, as well as Citic Group, which controls the biggest brokerage, Citic Securities Co., the people said.
The Finance Ministry has devised a formula tied to a number of performance indicators to cut the total amount entities pay to employees, the people said. Those that don’t meet government return expectations would need make deeper cuts to salaries. It would affect employees at all levels to varying degrees, with the firms in charge of devising the cuts to achieve an overall average reduction, they said.
The firms though are being encouraged to continue hiring while keeping the compensation pool unchanged, one of the people said.
The ministry, CIC, Citic Group, and CDB didn’t immediately reply to requests for a comment. ICBC declined to comment.
Unlike some banks in other parts of the world, big Chinese lenders so far have stuck to their dividends plans for the year, with the government keen on maintaining that cash flow amid a tight budget. But speculation has grown that the banks could eventually be forced to lower payouts as their bottom line comes under pressure.
The demands to lower pay could accelerate an exodus of top-level talent in China’s financial industry, where professionals have long groused over low compensation levels compared with global peers. It comes at an opportune time for global giants such as  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., who are seeking to hoover up talent as they push into China after the country opened up its financial markets fully to foreign competition this year.
CIC, the world’s second-biggest sovereign wealth fund, is already being hampered by a brain drain, with three of its top executives resigning since April. Managing directors and department heads at CIC typically earn 1 million yuan to 2 million yuan a year depending on performance. While that tops the pay of some government officials, it’s a drop in the bucket versus compensation on Wall Street.
Foreign banks have made a number of recent key profile hires. UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) snapped up Fan Yang from China Merchants Securities International as chairman of global banking for Asia in April, while  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG recently poached rainmaker Wang Jing from China Merchants Bank Co. to develop its wealth management business.
The plan could also spell another blow to bankers working at state-controlled banks in Hong Kong, who were recently told they would need to start paying mainland taxes which can be as high as 45%, compared with the city’s 15% rate.

1335,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 07:05PM ET</span>",U.S. Democrats press Postal Service after reports of delayed mail,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top two Democrats in Congress on Thursday called on the new U.S. Postal Service head to reverse changes that they say are resulting in delayed mail during a national health crisis that has made Americans more reliant on deliveries.
In a letter, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the operational changes put in place by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a supporter of President Donald Trump, who took over the agency in June.
""We believe these changes, made during the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic, now threaten the timely delivery of mail—including medicines for seniors, paychecks for workers, and absentee ballots for voters—that is essential to millions of Americans,"" the Democrats wrote, adding ""enacting these policies as cost-cutting or efficiency measures as the COVID-19 public health emergency continues is counterproductive and unacceptable.""
According to their letter, the changes included ""reductions of overtime availability, restrictions on extra mail transportation trips, testing of new mail sorting and delivery policies at hundreds of Post Offices."" 
A Postal Service spokesman did not comment on the new letter but said earlier the agency aims to ""increase operational efficiency by re-emphasizing existing plans that have been designed to provide prompt and reliable service within current service standards."" 
Voting my mail is expected to increase dramatically this fall due to November presidential elections amid the coronavirus pandemic. Trump has claimed without evidence that absentee voting leads to rampant fraud.
The Postal Service has faced financial woes with the rise of email and social media, and a measure passed in 2006 requiring it to prefund 75 years of retiree health benefits over the span of 10 years at a cost of more than $100 billion.
The agency's board of governors is set to meet Friday when it reports its third quarter financial results.

Separately, the top Senate Democrat the committee overseeing the Post Office, Gary Peters, said Thursday was launching an investigation into reported delivery delays, while senior House Democrats sent DeJoy a new letter asking additional questions.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's $65 billion debt restructuring agreement with bondholders will likely lead to credit upgrades but is far from ensuring the country's longer-term economic future, rating agencies told Reuters on Thursday.
After months of negotiations, Argentina reached an accord with key creditor groups on Tuesday to revamp the debt, after tumbling into its ninth sovereign default in May. The deal still needs to be formalized this month.
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) sovereign ratings analyst Gabriel Torres said it did not necessarily secure a positive economic outlook beyond the short term.
""All you've done is kick the can down the road,"" Torres said. ""It's not clear to me that the markets will lend to this administration going forward.""
Standard & Poor's plans to lift Argentina out of its current selective default (SD) rating after the formalization of the deal, said Lisa Schineller, the agency's lead analyst for sovereign ratings in Latin America. 
The exact rating, however, will depend on Argentina's growth trajectory, which has crippled under the impact of COVID-19. 
""The weakness in growth is not something that will change overnight, so that's going to keep the rating low,"" Schineller said.
Todd Martinez, director of Latin America sovereigns at Fitch Ratings, which downgraded Argentina to ""RD"" in May, said the country would get an exit rating on the deal, but it would only be a modest gain.
Argentina's growing fiscal deficit, high inflation and skewed foreign exchange rate will continue to impact its credit rating well beyond any deal, he said. 
""The outlook for further improvement in the rating after the restructuring is very uncertain,"" Martinez said. ""We'll want to see how Argentina navigates and addresses its deep imbalances.""
Argentina will eventually need to regain access to capital markets to stay on top of its restructured debt, which will not be straightforward. The economy is set to contract more than 10% this year and tight capital controls are in place.

""Can Argentina pay this new debt?"" Moody's Torres asked. ""That's going to be the next question.""

AbbVie denied the allegations, but agreed to look into how Humira is marketed to health care providers in the state, the regulator said
The Insurance Commissioner of California said the company also agreed to disclose that AbbVie, and not a medical provider, paid the registered nurses who are employed as so-called AbbVie Ambassadors to interact with patients about Humira.
Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said AbbVie has paid $24 million to California and the whistleblower, a registered nurse who brought the case to the department's attention in October 2016.
AbbVie said in a statement it was glad the settlement allows its nurse ambassador program to continue with no significant changes and noted that some parallel cases have been dismissed in other courts. 
Humira, the company's flagship arthritis treatment, brought in sales of $3.97 billion in the latest quarter. It has been the major driver of AbbVie's growth in recent years but faces expirations of its patents in U.S. in 2023. 

Among other things, the regulator had alleged AbbVie violated California's Insurance Frauds Prevention Act by unlawfully providing free and valuable professional goods and services to physicians to induce and reward Humira prescriptions.

Tuesday's blast was the most powerful in years in Lebanon, which is already reeling from an economic meltdown that has seen the Lebanese pound weaken by nearly 80% since last year, due to a lack of dollars, from an official peg of 1,507.5 - a rate now only available for vital imports.
Banks have since October frozen people out of their own savings accounts and blocked transfers abroad. Under an April central bank circular, they now pay depositors with dollar accounts in cash in the local currency at a ""market rate"" well below that of the parallel market.
The central bank said the exceptional loans should be made, regardless of customer account limits, to individuals, private businesses, small- and medium-sized enterprises and corporations - with the exception of real estate developers - to carry out essential repairs to homes and businesses.
The loans should carry no interest and be repaid over five years, it said, adding that they could be repaid in Lebanese pounds based on an interbank rate of 1,515 pounds to the dollar.
The central bank would in turn provide dollar loans at zero interest to the banks and financial institutions granting the exceptional loans, it said.
In a separate statement, the central bank also instructed money transfer houses to distribute transfers from abroad to Lebanon in dollars.
Lebanon's banking association said it was studying ""specific mechanisms"" to support employees and customers whose homes, stores and establishments were damaged in the blast. and would cooperate with the central bank to assist them in rebuilding.
The economic crisis is rooted in decades of state corruption and waste.

The government entered talks with the International Monetary Fund in May after defaulting on its foreign currency debt. But the talks have stalled in the absence of reforms and amid a dispute between the government, banks and politicians over the scale of Lebanon's vast financial losses.

(Reuters) - Shares of Rocket Cos Inc (N:RKT) rose 15% following their New York debut on Thursday, a day after the parent company of U.S. mortgage lender Quicken Loans slashed the targeted size of its initial public offering by over $1 billion.
Rocket shares were trading up at $20.84 after they opened flat at $18.00 a share, the same as its IPO price.
Rocket's relatively lukewarm flotation comes at a time when U.S. capital markets are in the middle of a stellar recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic put several debuts on hold earlier this year.
The IPO pricing and deal size suggests Rocket struggled to convince investors its mortgage platform business deserved the kind of valuation that is usually handed out to Silicon Valley tech unicorns.
""You're seeing a low-rate environment in conjunction with decreased (mortgage) applications,"" said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer for Capital Innovations, which invests in IPOs.
""So, investors are being very cautious, very surgical and ... if it's not a rock-solid business model, they're not really interested in buying at the IPO.""
The company sold 100 million shares, down from 150 million it had planned for the IPO, to raise $1.8 billion, which valued the company at around $36 billion.
At its IPO price of $18, it is now the third-largest U.S. listing of 2020, excluding blank-check companies. Only Royalty Pharma (O:RPRX) and  Warner Music Group  (O:WMG) have had bigger stock market debuts this year.
Within its original price range of $20-$22, Rocket could have become the largest U.S IPO of the year.
Rocket, founded by billionaire Dan Gilbert in 1985, said earlier this month it expects a profit of more than $3 billion in the second quarter, compared with a loss last year.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) were among the underwriters for the IPO.

1341,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 01:15PM ET</span>",CalPERS investment chief steps down at $400 billion pension fund,"By Alexandra Alper and Aishwarya Nair
(Reuters) - The investment chief of CalPERS, Yu Ben Meng, has resigned effective immediately, the largest public U.S. pension fund said on Wednesday, amid pressure from the Trump administration to curb investments in China.
Dan Bienvenue, deputy chief investment officer at the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), will become interim chief investment officer, the $400 billion fund said in a statement, adding it will begin an immediate search for a permanent successor.
A U.S. citizen born in China, Meng has twice worked for CalPERS, the first time starting in 2008 and the second time beginning in January 2019 when he became CIO, according to the CalPERS website.
In between the CalPERS stints, Meng worked for three years as deputy CIO with China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), which oversees China’s U.S. Treasury security holdings.
Meng cited the need to focus on health and family in the statement, released late on Wednesday. But the resignation comes amid growing pressure on U.S. funds to divest from Chinese companies.
Last month, White House Officials pressed the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board, the federally administered retirement plan for railroad workers, to avoid investments in Chinese companies, which may be hit with sanctions. 
And the White House successfully lobbied an independent board charged with overseeing billions in federal retirement dollars with suspending plans to allow a fund to track an index that invests in Chinese companies. 
CalPERS has not escaped scrutiny. Earlier this year, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused the fund of investing in firms that supply the Chinese military, putting American lives at risk. U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien also said U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was ""looking at"" CalPERS' investments in Chinese military companies.
U.S. Representative Jim Banks, a Republican, on Thursday welcomed Meng's resignation.
""Taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to fund our adversary’s military,"" he said in a statement. ""With Yu Ben Meng’s departure, CalPERS now has the opportunity to correct its course and divest from companies within China’s military-industrial complex.""
In February, Banks took aim at Meng himself, calling for an investigation into the executive over his ""cozy"" relationship with Beijing and assailing the fund's investments in Chinese companies in a letter earlier this year.
CalPERS did not immediately comment on Banks' remarks on Thursday, but at the time of his February letter, CEO Marcie Frost defended Meng in a statement.
""This is a reprehensible attack on a U.S. citizen. We fully stand behind our Chief Investment Officer who came to CalPERS with a stellar international reputation,"" she said. 

The fund manages pension and health benefits for more than 1.6 million California public employees, retirees and their families.

Weekly data that Reuters follows from sources ranging from the New York Federal Reserve to mobility tracking and small business payroll service providers shows that after big upticks in May and June, activity growth stalled in July as COVID-19 spread rapidly in key areas of the country across the South and Southwest. That recent flat-lining trend has persisted as August began.
Graphic - The economy in real time: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmvjrxrzvr/Pasted%20image%201596729676868.png
Time management firm Kronos https://www.kronos.com/about-us/newsroom/update-us-workforce-activity, for instance, reported that shifts worked in the week ended Aug. 2 were essentially unchanged nationally but fell in 19 states, primarily in the Midwest. The Kronos data showed that shift growth peaked at 8.7% in May, then slowed to 5.9% in June and to just 1% in July.
Employment at small businesses managed by Homebase https://joinhomebase.com/data edged down in the latest week.
""We've now settled into a clear plateau in shift work growth,"" Dave Gilbertson, vice president for Kronos' HCM practice group, said in a statement. ""What remains to be seen is how long shift work will remain stalled and whether we'll start to see a greater divergence across individual regions as they recover at different rates.""
""The remainder of summer will tell us whether the volume of COVID-19 cases means we've hit a peak in the recovery for the foreseeable, or if jobs growth will improve or slide backwards.""
The surge in COVID-19 cases, particularly in southern and southwestern states, has pushed the U.S. case total to almost 5 million, according to a Reuters tally https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-USA/0100B5K8423/index.html, and deaths are nearing 160,000.
Alongside the plateau in hourly worker shifts, measures of foot traffic to commercial destinations has also hit a wall after steady increases in May and June.
Estimates of national foot traffic based on mobile phone data analyzed by Safegraph https://www.safegraph.com/dashboard/covid19-commerce-patterns, indexed to March 1, fell to the lowest since late May. In the second week of June, that data had indicated that foot traffic had recovered to nearly 98% of March 1 levels, but in the latest week had retreated to 91.2%.
Similar data from Unacast https://www.unacast.com/covid19/covid-19-retail-impact-scoreboard shows the same peak in activity in mid-June with effectively no change since.
Other measures that combine a range of factors including demand, employment and health data paint a similar picture.
An Oxford http://blog.oxfordeconomics.com/topic/recovery-tracker Economics index combining a variety of economic, health and other measures has remained flat in recent weeks. Its health component, which had improved into mid-June, is now at its lowest since late April.

Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, in a statement, also urged the international community and friends of Lebanon ""to step up to help the country"".
""The IMF is exploring all possible ways to support the people of Lebanon,"" she said. ""It is essential to overcome the impasse in the discussions on critical reforms and put in place a meaningful program to turn around the economy and build accountability and trust in the future of the country.""

The Lebanese government entered talks with IMF in May after defaulting on its foreign currency debt, but the negotiations have stalled in the absence of reforms and amid a row between the government, banks and politicians over the scale of the country's vast financial losses.

Some small businesses that were struggling financially will fail because of the resurgence in coronavirus infections, and small businesses in the service sector will take the biggest hit, Kaplan said during an online webinar with the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum Foundation. 
""One area where financial conditions are not loose and we are seeing stress is in small, mid-sized businesses, particularly those in person-to-person contact industries,"" Kaplan said. ""I think there is probably a debate to be had, what can we do to continue to help small businesses.""
Supporting small businesses that would be viable were it not for the epidemic can help to ""manage"" the unemployment rate and reduce the number of people who lose their jobs, Kaplan said. 
He said the Fed still has ""plenty of fire power"" to support the economy, but repeated his view that the pace of the economic recovery will depend on the management of the virus and whether people wear masks.
As for the tools the Fed should consider, Kaplan said he was still skeptical about the idea that the U.S. central bank should adopt yield curve control, which would target interest rates at specific maturities. 
""I’m going to keep an open mind about it,"" Kaplan said. Still, he said he is ""sensitive to actions we might take that further muffle the pricing signals of markets or distort the pricing signals of markets."" 

Kaplan also said the Fed's asset purchases ""are not free"" and could ultimately threaten the status of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency.

1346,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 11:25AM ET</span>",U.S. household debt falls amid COVID-19 spending cutbacks,"(Reuters) - U.S. households cut their debt for the first time in six years in the second quarter, led by a record drop in credit card balances as consumers cut back on non-essential spending during coronavirus lockdowns and paid down what they owed, a New York Federal Reserve survey showed on Thursday.
The $34 billion drop in overall household debt to $14.27 trillion in the three months ended June 30 was the largest since the second quarter of 2013, the New York Fed's Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit found.
By far the biggest driver was plunging credit card balances: The $76 billion decline to around $820 billion - the lowest since the first quarter of 2018 - was more than twice the previous record set in the first quarter. The series dates to 2003.
Combined with the first quarter's $34 billion reduction, consumers shaved their credit card debt by an unprecedented $110 billion, or roughly 12%, in the first six months of 2020. About a third of the decline in credit card debt is attributable to the big drop in consumer spending in the second quarter, with the rest coming from households paying down balances.
Meanwhile, record-low interest rates have fueled a home loan refinancing boom that lifted mortgage debt by $63 billion to $9.78 trillion, the highest ever. Mortgage originations totaled $846 billion in the quarter, the largest since 2013, with almost all of the increase arising from refinancings and most of that associated with borrowers with top credit scores.

Foreclosure proceedings also screeched to a near halt in the second quarter and delinquency rates declined as a result of forbearance provisions in the CARES Act passed by Congress in March to provide consumers relief during the epidemic as tens of millions were thrown out of work because of stay-at-home orders.

(Reuters) - The United States should take a more targeted approach with its new pandemic aid so it can save ammunition in case of a future economic slowdown or a second wave of infections, former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Thursday.
""We should provide the relief that is needed, but not act as if we have infinite fiscal space,"" Rajan, currently professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. 
""Just because one can spend at this point, doesn't mean one has a blank cheque.""
The surge in U.S. coronavirus cases is beginning to slow its economic recovery, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday after the Fed said it was leaving interest rates near zero, promising the central bank would ""do what we can, and for as long as it takes,"" to limit damage and boost growth.
Rajan said he expected a new U.S. coronavirus relief bill, to be somewhere between the $1 trillion that Republicans want and the $3 trillion that the Democrats are demanding.
Top congressional Democrats and White House officials appeared to harden their stances on the package on Wednesday, as negotiations headed toward an end-of-week deadline with no sign of an agreement.
""The unemployment insurance benefits top-up should probably not be at $600 per week, but should taper down over time,"" Rajan said.
He also said it would be a mistake to prop up closing businesses indefinitely, if the pandemic persists.
""Relief is better targeted at medium-sized businesses that have difficulty accessing finance and that employ a fair number of people.""
FED ON WAIT AND WATCH
Rajan, formerly the chief economist and director of research at the International Monetary Fund, said the Fed seemed in no hurry to raise rates, but he didn't expect rates to go into negative territory either.
""There is some mixed evidence from across the world, and so, I think the Fed at this point is willing to wait and watch...,"" he said.
Graphic: Central bank balance sheets - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdpzdamepw/Pasted%20image%201596639169203.png
Rajan said he sees the Fed continuing with the existing instruments and maybe attempting some forward guidance.
""One possible area of action is yield curve targeting - YCT - and that is the place where some innovation may take place,"" he added.

Rajan said U.S. rates could remain low indefinitely, as long as inflation remained stable.
If prices pick up earlier than anticipated, then global central banks might have to switch from stimulating their economies to fighting inflation, which he said ""could be problematic.""
""There is an ideal time, may be two or three years down the line, when economies hopefully are recovered, and inflation helps reduce the real value of the debt that has built up,"" Rajan said.
""At that point many central banks will find it appropriate to shrink the size of their balance sheets.""

1350,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 08:27AM ET</span>",ECB Says It Had No Role in Key Decision on Wirecard Oversight,"(Bloomberg) -- The European Central Bank denied any involvement in deciding that Wirecard AG (OTC:WCAGY) wasn’t a financial holding company, a crucial determination that gave authorities limited powers in scrutinizing the firm ahead of its spectacular collapse.
The decision was instead the sole responsibility of German supervisor BaFin, according to Andrea Enria, the head of the ECB’s supervisory arm. In a letter to a German EU lawmaker, Martin Schirdewan, he said his institution “did not play a role in assessing whether Wirecard AG was a financial holding company from a prudential perspective,” adding that this was the “sole competence” of national authorities -- in this case BaFin.
German lawmakers have said that the failure to classify Wirecard as a financial holding was a key shortcoming of supervisors, as such an assessment would have allowed for much stricter accounting controls. BaFin President Felix Hufeld told the parliament in Berlin that “all previous decisions were taken in consensus with the involved institutions, the German Bundesbank and the ECB,” a spokeswoman said after he gave testimony last month.
Even with ample warning, German authorities failed to catch accounting issues at the digital-payments company, whose collapse has shaken confidence in the country’s finance industry. Much of the criticism has centered on BaFin, which has acknowledged that it’s one of the institutions that fell short, while defending its actions.
Hufeld has already faced accusations that he gave false information regarding BaFin’s contacts with authorities in Singapore over Wirecard, though a spokeswoman said he was merely “imprecise” when he said which authority BaFin had contacted and has since clarified that in conversations with lawmakers.
Enria also said that entities within the Wirecard group “neither qualified as a payment system nor as a payment scheme and thus were not subject to payments oversight” by the ECB.
The parliamentary finance committee will hold a special hearing into the Wirecard scandal on Aug. 31 and Sept. 1 with representatives from the Chancellery, the Justice Ministry, BaFin, and the Bundesbank.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 08:20AM ET</span>",Job cuts announced by U.S. companies jump 54% in July: report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers announced another 262,649 job cuts in July as the COVID-19 pandemic continued to weigh on demand, the latest indication that the labor market recovery is losing steam.
The layoffs reported by global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Thursday were up 54% from June. 
The job cuts, the third-largest monthly total since the coronavirus pandemic began, followed data this week showing a big step-down in private payrolls in July and further contraction in employment at manufacturing and services industries.
Hiring announcements totaled 246,507 in July, almost matching layoffs, Challenger, Gray reported. 
""The downturn is far from over, especially as COVID cases rise around the country,"" said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray. ""Consumers are buying fewer goods and services, businesses are closing, and bankruptcies are rising.""
July's job cuts brought the total so far this year to 1.848 million, up 212% from the same period in 2019. The year-to-date layoffs are just 109,180 away from the record 1.957 million job cuts announced in 2001.
The weak labor market data raises the risk of a sharper slowdown in job growth in July. The Labor Department will publish its closely watched, and broader, monthly employment report on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 1.6 million in July, down from the record 4.8 million jobs created in June. 
According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, COVID-19 was cited as the reason for 63,517 job cuts in July. The respiratory illness has been blamed for 1.075 million layoffs so far this year. The balance of job cuts in July were attributed to market conditions, a downturn in demand and bankruptcies. 
Several retailers including J.C. Penney and Lord & Taylor have filed for bankruptcy since March. Job cuts remained concentrated at bars, restaurants, hotels and amusement parks. The automotive sector cut 83,853 jobs. Hiring announcements totaled 246,507 in July, almost matching layoffs. 

""It is clear that many job losses are now permanent, and it will be challenging for many workers to find new jobs and feel safe taking jobs that are public-facing,"" said Challenger.

1352,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 07:54AM ET</span>",School Closings Leave NYC as Lone Holdout and Economy Sputtering,"(Bloomberg) -- New York City is the only major U.S. school system still considering in-person classes this fall, after Chicago rebuffed President Donald Trump’s calls to reopen to avoid further strain on the U.S. economy.
Chicago Public Schools will begin the academic year with all-virtual learning, the nation’s third-largest district announced Wednesday, after administrators bowed to pressure from nervous staff and parents. New York City officials say they are still on track to open in September with a hybrid of in-class and remote instruction, though they need approval from Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has said he will make a final decision this week.
The national rush to all-remote learning will keep parents struggling to work and teach their children simultaneously, businesses navigating those conflicts, and the virus-wracked country that much further away from normality.
“It’s a huge blow to the economy, and to the long-term potential for growth,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago. “Unfortunately we’ve put ourselves in a position where it’s getting harder to see how we’re going to sustain a rebound in the third quarter.”
In Chicago alone, the decision affects 355,000 students -- kids whose parents had expected them to be in classrooms starting Sept. 8. Other major school districts that have already opted for virtual instruction for at least the start of the year include Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Miami, Atlanta and Houston. If New York City joins in, that would affect the families of another 1.1 million students.
The cities are taking these steps as Covid-19 infections spike across the U.S., choosing to be cautious amid conflicting data about how susceptible kids are to contract or spread the disease.
Coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 1.1% Wednesday compared to the day before, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News The virus, which has infected 4.79 million Americans and killed more then 158,000, is surging in many parts of the South and West, as the Midwest and Northeast try to rein in flare-ups.
California reported its second-biggest day of new cases on Wednesday and the positive-test rate in Texas climbed for a fourth-straight day. In New York City, one of the earliest parts of the U.S. to be hit hard, Mayor Bill De Blasio stepped up enforcement of quarantines for out-of-state visitors with checkpoints at airports and train stations.
North Carolina paused its reopening for five weeks, keeping businesses including bars, movie theaters and bowling alleys closed, and limiting the size of gatherings.
“Other states that lifted restrictions quickly have had to go backward as their hospital capacity ran dangerously low and their cases jumped higher,” said Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat. “We won’t make that mistake in North Carolina.”
The decisions about travel, business and education are being made against unrelenting pressure from Trump, whose theories on the topic aren’t always supported by his own health experts.
“This thing’s going away -- it will go away like things go away and my view is that schools should be open,” Trump said Wednesday on Fox News. Children “are virtually immune from this problem. And we have to open our schools.”
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has rejected this claim. There are parts of the country where schools shouldn’t open to in-person teaching, the doctor told Bloomberg Television on Wednesday, and testing for the disease needs to improve, especially in the speed to obtain results.
Studies of Children
There is conflicting data about how Covid-19 is transmitted to and from children,
A study published in JAMA last month -- based on work in a Chicago pediatric hospital -- suggests infected kids with even just mild symptoms can still have 10 to 100 times the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in their noses and throats as older kids or adults, making them more likely to spread it. An earlier Chinese study, however, found that most children with Covid-19 admitted to a hospital lived in households with previously infected adults, indicating the child caught the virus from the adult rather than transmitting it.
A small number of kids have died or required intensive care as a result of either the respiratory failure commonly associated with the virus or an inflammatory condition sometimes described as similar to Kawasaki disease that causes heart or circulatory problems.
That leaves school officials largely at the mercy of their local health officials for guidance. In Chicago, the district will work with the city Department of Public Health to assess if it is safe to open with hybrid learning in the second quarter on Nov. 9.
Exposing Inequities
The economic effects of keeping children out of school go beyond matters of convenience and pocketbook. The also expose imbalances in the economy, with some children unable to access the internet as easily as others.
“The first-order short-term economic impacts will be likely centered around what this does to families needing childcare; loss of school meals for the kids making hunger worse; and whatever furloughing the district is doing,” said Diane Schanzenbach, professor at the School of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern (NYSE:NWE) University. “Long term, the costs of all of this lost learning will be with us for decades.”
Senate Republicans have proposed a bill that would provide $70 billion to K-12 schools, but that may not be enough to safely reopen, or even to go remote and provide needed tech to low-income families. More than $116 billion will be needed to safely reopen the nation’s public schools, according to an estimate from the American Federation of Teachers union.
Congressional Hearing
Congress is scheduled to hold a remote hearing on safely reopening schools Thursday with former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. The hearing follows current Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’s threat last month to defund schools that don’t open in person full-time.
The teacher’s unions have been lobbying heavily against in-person school, citing budget restraints and health risks for staff and pupils. In Chicago, educators already went on strike last year to demand more nurses, librarians and counselors. The Chicago Teachers Union estimated last month that it would cost between $450 million and $1.7 billion to reopen the city’s public schools safely, depending on the model.
New York City’s hybrid plan, which includes schools getting cleaned daily and ,mandatory masks, has been criticized by state officials, who have described it as more of an outlier. De Blasio says they will shut down if the city’s infection rate exceeds 3% over seven days.
“We are trying to maximize in-person learning for the good of our kids because we know it makes a world of difference,” de Blasio said during an Aug. 3 news briefing. “Online is a tool we will use when we need to use it, but it’s inherently imperfect.

1353,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 07:50AM ET</span>",China central bank says it will make policy more flexible and targeted,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's central bank said on Thursday it would make its prudent monetary policy more flexible and targeted, and keep liquidity appropriately ample to support economic recovery.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it would maintain a reasonable rise in money supply and total social financing, and ensure banks had the credit supply to match firms' demand for loans to support economic recovery.
""We will comprehensively use and innovate a variety of monetary policy tools, and keep liquidity reasonably ample,"" the central bank said in its second-quarter monetary policy report.
The central bank will base the strength and pace of its monetary policy on the success of virus control efforts and the economic and financial situation, it said.
Central bank policy adviser Ma Jun said in remarks published on Wednesday that the PBOC does not need to step up its policy easing as an economic recovery is well under way, and further stimulus could stoke property and stock bubbles.
The PBOC said it expected the macro leverage ratio to gradually return to a reasonable level, after allowing the debt level to climb due to economic stimulus.
Central bank officials have said the macro leverage ratio rose 14.5 percentage points in the first quarter.
The PBOC said non-performing loans could rise due to the coronavirus crisis, and commercial banks had been told to conduct stress tests for this and formulate contingency plans.

China will also stabilise land prices, home prices and property market expectations, the PBOC said in the report, posted on its website, reiterating that it would not use the housing market as a short-term stimulus.

1354,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 06:33AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday, August 6th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The U.S. sandwiches in jobless claims numbers between the two big monthly assessments of the labor market. Stock markets are set to open mixed as U.S. lawmakers continue to haggle over the next fiscal support measures. Germany's factories are set to start humming again but European earnings disappoint, and gold and silver march to new highs. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, August 6th.
1. Jobless claims due as lawmakers continue to haggle
As lawmakers haggle over the next package of measures to support the economy, the U.S. will release its latest weekly numbers for those claiming unemployment benefits.
Initial jobless claims are expected to have fallen back slightly last week after a two-week blip, although the number of continuing claims is set to remain at acutely high levels.
Economists expect 1.415 million in initial claims, down from 1.434 million last week, and 16.72 million continuing claims, down from 17.02 million.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said on Wednesday that the two parties remain far apart in their search for a compromise package, adding that “If we don’t have a deal by Friday, I’m not optimistic that more time will get us there.” The White House is reportedly threatening to break the deadlock with executive orders if the two chambers of Congress can’t craft a compromise.
2. Germany set for rebound, but European earnings slump
Germany’s recovery is on the way. Factory orders, a generally reliable advance indicator for Europe’s industrial heartland, rose by a record 27.9% in June, far above expectations for a 10.4% gain. There were strong rebounds for the auto industry, and for orders from outside the euro zone.
Orders were still more than 11% down from a year earlier, however.
Elsewhere in Europe, industrial production in Italy also rebounded by 8.2% in June, stronger than the 5.1% expected.
The data cushioned the blow from a generally dismal round of earnings, in which Lufthansa reported its biggest ever quarterly operating loss, Adidas also went into the red, and insurer AXA and commodities trader Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) scrapped their dividends.
3. Stocks set to open mixed as death toll rises again
U.S. stock markets are set to open mixed, hesitant to extend recent gains against a backdrop of deadlock on Capitol Hill. Wednesday’s coronavirus data, which showed more U.S. deaths than on any other day bar one, are also keeping the pandemic uppermost in many minds.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 12 points or less than 0.1%, while the US 500 Futures contract was also flat and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 0.1%
Today’s big results updates in the U.S. are mainly after the closing bell, coming from T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS), Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG), Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) and Uber (NYSE:UBER). There could also be interest in some Japanese ADRs, with  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) forecasting a $7 billion profit for the current fiscal year, and Nintendo (OTC:NTDOY) reporting a six-fold increase in profit thanks to the pandemic.
4  Pound gains as Bank of England holds; EM CBs start to run out of road
The Bank of England said the U.K. economy will need at least until the end of 2021 to return to pre-pandemic levels of output.
However, it also said that it now expects the economic decline in the meantime to be a little smaller, in comments explaining a unanimous decision not to make any changes to its interest rates or bond-buying programs at its regular Monetary Policy Committee meeting.
The pound, which was also supported by a stronger-than-expected Construction PMI, strengthened against the dollar and euro,
Earlier, the Reserve Bank of India became the second central bank of a major emerging economy inside 24 hours to warn that it was running out of scope for further interest rate cuts. Unlike its Brazilian counterpart, the RBI held its key rate unchanged. It also indicated it would take a softer line as banking supervisor with regard to banks' non-performing loans. 
Turkey, meanwhile, continues to lurch toward a financial crisis, with the dollar rising another 3% to a new record high against the lira.
5. Oil consolidates; precious metals march higher
Commodity markets went back into risk-off mode, with crude oil prices giving up some of the gains they made on strong U.S. inventory data on Wednesday.
U.S. crude futures were down 0.9% at $41.80 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent was down 0.3% at $45.02 a barrel.
By contrast, haven assets gold and silver marched higher, Gold Futures breaking through $2,050 an ounce for the first time ever and silver futures hitting another seven-year high but failing just short of the $28/oz level.
Precious metals remain supported by signs of inflation bottoming out and expectations rising, even as nominal bond yields grind lower."
1355,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 06:31AM ET</span>","As U.S. Congress wrangles over aid, millions of renters get desperate","By Jonnelle Marte
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amanda Geno accepted what felt like a dream job offer on March 13 from a college near Holyoke, Massachusetts, putting an end to a six-month search after she was laid off in the fall. Or so she thought. 
Three days later, the college told the 39-year-old fundraiser that the promised job would need to be put on hold. At the end of April, she was notified the team she was to join wouldn't be hiring until 2021. 
Geno and her wife, a full-time student who receives $900 in monthly disability benefits, have been able to keep paying their nearly $1,200 rent bill and other expenses largely because Geno was among those eligible to receive up to $600 in enhanced weekly unemployment benefits enacted under the CARES Act, the coronavirus aid package passed by Congress in March. 
Congress recently let those benefits lapse, cutting her total weekly payments including state benefits from $1,100 after taxes to just shy of $600.
Some of the loan and credit card payments the couple deferred also are coming due this month, adding about $1,600 to their monthly expenses. A tax refund due to arrive this week should help pay the rent for September. 
But with much of their savings depleted, Geno isn't sure the rent can be paid after next month.
""I fully feel that without extended help we are going to be under water in probably two months,"" Geno said.
The job losses caused by nationwide shutdowns imposed in March and April to control the spread of the novel coronavirus disproportionately hit low-wage workers who are more likely to be renters. 
A patchwork of eviction moratoriums across the country that vary by state have allowed some renters to stay in their residences if they can't pay the rent, but they are still on the hook for the back rent that is piling up. Americans owed more than $21.5 billion in past-due rent as of the end of July, according to estimates from the global advisory firm Stout, Risius and Ross.
That burden is expected to grow if unemployed workers don't receive more assistance, say housing advocates, economists and landlords. 
""This problem is going to grow as the year goes on,"" said Marietta Rodriguez, president and chief executive of NeighborWorks America, a nonprofit organization focused on affordable housing.
PRESSURE ON CONGRESS TO ACT
Congress, which passed nearly $3 trillion in coronavirus-related aid early in the epidemic, missed a deadline last week to extend the enhanced unemployment payments.
Democrats had pressed for another $3 trillion that would retain the benefit and add nearly $1 trillion in assistance for state and local governments. Senate Republicans have proposed a $1 trillion package that would slash the unemployment payment to $200 a week and eventually move to replace 70% of wages.
Without further action by Congress, more than 30 million Americans receiving unemployment benefits are on track to see their incomes cut in half or more, housing experts and economists say. Benefits in some states are poised to drop to little more than a few hundred dollars a week. 
Many households are already feeling the strain. More than 13 million renters, or nearly 20% of renter households, missed rent payments in June, according to a survey last month by the U.S. Census Bureau. About a third of renters said they have slight to no confidence in their ability to make the rent in August, the survey found. 
Against that grim backdrop, between 19 million and 23 million Americans are at risk of being evicted by Sept. 30, according to a June analysis by the Aspen Institute. 
Evictions could rise after the expiration last month of a moratorium on evictions at rental properties financed with federally-backed mortgages, as well as the winding down of similar measures across the country over the coming weeks and months. In some areas, renters already are being evicted illegally, said Alieza Durana, a journalist with Princeton University's Eviction Lab, which has built a nationwide database of evictions. 
Some landlords are advocating for an extension of the weekly unemployment benefits supplement or other financial assistance that can help keep tenants in their homes.
""We're still amidst an emergency across the country,"" said David Schwartz, chief executive and chairman of Waterton, which owns and operates 23,000 rental units across the country. 
Given the surge in unemployment, Schwartz says it would be difficult for those who are out of work to afford their rent, groceries and other bills if the supplement falls below $400. Recent shutdowns caused by a resurgence in COVID-19 cases are creating more uncertainty for households. ""I think it's pretty critical that Congress does something,"" he added.
Jamila King, 31, has been behind on the rent on her apartment in Brooklyn, New York, since April, when the health insurance company she works for cut her hours. While she can work from home, the reduced pay is not enough to cover her rent and other bills, which add up to about $2,000 a month. 
Her landlord has been lenient, allowing her to pay about half the rent each month while she looks for a second job or waits for her employer to give her more hours.

The European Union Chamber of Commerce said the survey, conducted in July, had received answers from 143 companies, or about a quarter of its members.
Of the respondents who had staff yet to return to Shanghai, 53% said it was because of administrative requirements involved in obtaining a re-entry visa, while 48% had their applications denied or delayed. Small and medium firms (SMEs), in particular, were affected disproportionately, the chamber said.
""Securing the return of foreign nationals to Shanghai is critical to restoring normality for our member companies, especially SMEs,"" said Carlo D'Andrea, vice president and the Shanghai chairman of the European Chamber.
""Declining revenues and the lack of predictability, coupled with the increasing unwelcoming atmosphere experienced by many, are beginning to pose a threat to the long-term viability of the Shanghai market for foreign investors.""
The Shanghai city government and the Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Having managed to curb domestic transmission of the virus, China now regards cases imported from abroad as the biggest threat and has relaxed its rules only to allow some business travel from South Korea, Germany and Singapore.
Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Chamber, said 2,500 German business people usually based in China had yet to return.
Also of concern, Wuttke said, was the inability of many foreign teachers to return to their schools in China, especially as the schools look to reopen for a new term in September.
Across the southwestern cities of Chongqing and Chengdu, as well as the capital Beijing, about 4,700 foreign national teachers and their dependents were still stuck abroad and this could potentially dent plans to resume classes, he said.

1357,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>","World food price index rises in July, extending rebound","PARIS (Reuters) - World food prices rose in July led by vegetable oils, dairy products and sugar, extending a rebound from the previous month following sharp falls triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.
The Food and Agriculture Organization's food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 94.2 points in July versus a slightly revised June figure of 93.1 points.
""Similar to June, further increases in the prices of vegetable oils, dairy products and sugar outweighed lower prices in the meat markets amid overall steady value of the cereal price index,"" the FAO said in a statement.
The agency's vegetable oil price index climbed 7.6% in July to reach a five-month high. 
Palm oil was buoyed by expected production slowdowns, revived global demand and protracted migrant labour shortages, while soyoil and rapeseed oil were underpinned, respectively, by tightening supply in Brazil and fresh demand in Europe, it said.
Vegetable oil demand had been curbed earlier in the year by lockdown measures to counter the novel coronavirus, dampening restaurant and biofuel demand.
In dairy, all products tracked by the FAO rose last month, helping the dairy price index rise 3.5% and climb back above the pre-pandemic level, the agency said.
Milk powders rose due to strong import demand by Asian buyers amid concern about export availabilities in Oceania. Butter and cheese were supported by robust import demand but remained below pre-pandemic levels, FAO said.
Average sugar prices rose 1.4%, with support from rising energy prices and drought-reduced production in Thailand, partly offset by strong sugar crush volumes in Brazil.
In contrast, the FAO's meat index slipped 1.8% and was 9.2% below the year-earlier level, as global import demand continued to lag availability despite coronavirus-linked disruptions to slaughtering.

The cereal index was almost unchanged, with sharp gains for maize (corn) and sorghum linked to Chinese purchases of U.S. suppliers offset by weaker rice quotations and stable wheat prices.

""They are part of our toolbox,"" Bailey told reporters after the BoE published its latest outlook on the economy. ""But at the moment we do not have a plan to use them.""
Bailey also said the central bank's projection that unemployment would hit 7.5% - almost double its current rate - was a ""very bad story"" but it was expected to fall back over time and inflation was likely to rise back to the BoE's target.

1360,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>","U.S. Jobs Report to Mark Slowdown, or Worse, in Labor Recovery","(Bloomberg) -- After a surge in coronavirus cases across the U.S., all signs point to a slowdown in job gains last month -- or worse.
Friday’s employment report is forecast to show a 1.5 million increase in nonfarm payrolls in July, the median estimate in projections ranging from a 600,000 decline to a gain of 3.2 million. That’s following a combined rise of 7.5 million in May and June, which just started to make up the 22 million drop over the first two months of the pandemic.
The unemployment rate is projected to fall to 10.5% -- still triple the pre-crisis level -- from 11.1%.
An increase in new Covid-19 cases starting in mid-June, especially in the South and West, added further uncertainty to the economic rebound and spurred a slew of states to halt or reverse reopenings. While there’s little doubt the recovery has mostly stalled in recent weeks, economists’ forecasts for the July jobs numbers depend on how much weight is put on traditional and non-traditional indicators of employment.
ADP Research Institute data missed all estimates Wednesday, showing a 167,000 increase in private payrolls for July, though the initial figures from May and June both ended up being well below the government’s official numbers.
High Frequency Indicators
Looking at higher frequency labor-market indicators, the signals range from slower improvement to getting much worse.
Initial jobless claims for regular state programs have held in an elevated range of 1.3 million to 1.5 million. Continuing claims for those same programs have dropped by about 2 million during the period covered by the jobs report, a sign of hiring. In the most recent data, though, both measures have started to creep higher.
Meanwhile, an employment measure from Homebase -- a scheduling tool used by more than 100,000 local businesses -- has largely plateaued. St. Louis Fed economists said in a blog post that their index based on the data “suggests that the recent recovery in employment has halted.”
The Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey, which publishes weekly insights about Americans’ experiences during the pandemic, was even more downbeat. Comparing the mid-June and mid-July surveys, the number of Americans who said they were employed in the last seven days declined by about 6.7 million.
“If you put all of these together, it does point to a real stalling in the labor market in July,” said Oxford Economics senior economist Lydia Boussour, who forecasts a 280,000 decline in nonfarm payrolls.
More Momentum
Stephen Gallagher, chief U.S. economist at Societe Generale SA, disagrees. He’s estimating a 2.66 million payroll gain, pointing to likely increases in health care, personal services, manufacturing and construction, as overshadowing closures at bars and gyms.
“I think we just have a lot of momentum,” Gallagher said.
The timing of July’s renewed job losses is key. For instance, California, the nation’s largest state, closed indoor businesses during the reference period.
If the deterioration in employment actually coincided with the July survey reference week, the impact might not be seen until the August report, said Bloomberg economist Yelena Shulyatyeva. Bloomberg Economics changed its nonfarm payrolls estimate to a 500,000 gain from a 1 million decline.
The composition of job gains will be critical. Sectors such as manufacturing, construction and health care likely continued to rebound from their April lows. Yet hiring in sectors more vulnerable to a virus resurgence, like retail and leisure and hospitality, may have lost momentum amid renewed closures.
Non-federal government jobs could be a wild card. Typically there’s a steep decline in state and local education payrolls in July with the end of the school year, so the Bureau of Labor Statistics adjusts the figures higher to smooth the seasonal pattern. This year, however, education employment has already fallen greatly. Meanwhile, state and local governments are also facing steep revenue declines, squeezing state budgets, which could lead to further job losses.
The longer the pandemic has stretched on, the more businesses have had to make permanent cuts to headcounts -- in part because more firms are closing for good.
In April, about three-fourths of job losses were of a temporary nature. Each month, that share has fallen as the number of permanent job losers has continued to rise.
A systemic shift from temporary to permanent job losses suggests the labor market will recover more slowly, with many companies hesitant to hire new employees amid widespread economic uncertainty.
Another number to watch is the underemployment rate, or the U-6 rate, a more inclusive measure given it also reflects those who quit looking for a job because they were discouraged about their prospects and those working part-time but desiring a full workweek.
The number working part time for economic reasons has declined each month since April while remaining stubbornly high. Rather than laying off workers, many businesses have looked to cut hours or pay.
“A labor market recovery isn’t just increasing employment, it’s also making sure the people who do have a job are getting the number of hours they actually want,” said Nick Bunker, the economic research director for North America at jobs website Indeed.

The biggest revision came in the euro zone where Deutsche now forecasts the economy to contract 8.6% this year compared to the previous expectation of a 12% decline. 
""In the Euro-area, the Q2 outcome tells us that activity did not plunge quite as far as feared in lockdown. It also tells us that the post-lockdown rebound was stronger than expected,"" the bank said.
It also raised estimates for the global economy by 1.5 percentage points, now predicting it to shrink 4.5% this year.
Deutsche expects the U.S. economy to contract by 5.2% in 2020, versus the previous minus 7.1% forecast. It also seen the world's biggest economy to grow 3.1% next year, rather than the 2.6% it had earlier predicted.
The German bank's estimates on inflation were less optimistic, with euro zone price growth in particular coming under downward pressure from recent euro appreciation against the dollar. It does not expect euro area inflation to return to pre-COVID levels until 2025. 
""We are not expecting the structural impact of the pandemic ...to outweigh the impact of the large output gap,"" the bank's research note added.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A planned link-up of the EU and Swiss carbon markets will be operational from September, the European Commission said, giving companies a broader pool of potential partners with which to trade emissions permits. 
The EU carbon market is the bloc's flagship policy for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, which it does by forcing power plants, factories and airlines to buy permits to cover some of the pollution they emit.
The EU-Swiss emissions trading link has been years in the making, but an initial launch date in May was delayed due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
The two registries are not yet connected by a permanent link, but will use a provisional system to launch trading this year, the Commission said late on Wednesday.
Transactions of allowances between the two markets will be possible from 21 September. Any allowances traded between the two systems will be transferred on 10 one-day windows from September-December. The first transfer window is 28 September.
A full calendar of transfer dates for 2021 will be published at the end of November 2020, the Commission said. 
The EU carbon market covered just shy of 1.6 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) last year. The Swiss carbon market is much smaller, covering less than 5 million tonnes of CO2e from industrial facilities in 2019. 
The volume of emissions covered by the Swiss scheme will increase this year, as Swiss power plants and some flights will be added to the market.
The EU is also considering linking its emissions trading system with a new British carbon market, which Britain plans to set up when it leaves the EU scheme at the end of this year as the Brexit transition period ends. 

Britain has said it will consider linking the two systems if it suits both parties' interests.

In the third quarter, mortgage demand is expected to ease slightly, the new survey showed.
In its previous survey of the banking industry, released in late April, Norges Bank had said the country could face its biggest quarterly decline in mortgage demand since the financial crisis more than a decade ago.
But as the central bank slashed its key policy rate to zero, the cheaper credit quickly drove an upturn in demand for housing, with prices rising at their fastest rate in three years in July, data released on Wednesday showed.
Norwegian businesses meanwhile sought slightly less credit in the second quarter, as had been anticipated by the previous survey, with a rebound now predicted in the time ahead.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government should remove a 10% sales tax to revive an economy dragged down by the coronavirus pandemic, a ruling party lawmaker close to Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said on Thursday, expressing a view that may gain traction as the country's recession deepens.
Hiroshi Ando is among a group of junior Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmakers proposing that Japan get rid of the sales tax and directly subsidise firms to prevent business closures.
Ando said the government's decision to raise the sales tax rate to 10% from 8% last October was a ""clear mistake"" because the economy was already in a downturn by then.
""We need to revive the economy by pushing the sales tax rate back to zero,"" he told Reuters on Thursday. ""It's absolutely essential that Japan eliminate the tax altogether.""
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration has rebuffed the idea of rolling back the sales tax.
But the rare direct rebuke from a ruling party lawmaker underscores a growing concern within the LDP over the damage the pandemic is inflicting on the economy and Abe's popularity.
Support rate for Abe's administration hit a record low 35.4% in a poll by broadcaster TBS released on Monday, reflecting people's dissatisfaction over its handling of the pandemic.
When Ando's group made the proposal in March, it had the ears of Abe, who told parliament he ""took note of calls from junior LDP officials to take drastic action on the sales tax.""
""We'll take sufficient action quickly as the pandemic would have a significant impact on the economy,"" Abe added.
Abe had proceeded with a twice-delayed sales tax hike to 10% in October, arguing that the proceeds are crucial to pay for rising social welfare costs of a rapidly ageing population.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's efforts to support its economy through the coronavirus crisis were being hampered by the slow disbursement of a $50 billion stimulus plan, economists said.The World Bank and Indonesian government have warned that millions more people risk being plunged into poverty amid the pandemic, as data showed the economy shrank for the first time since 1999 in the second quarter.
Five months after its launch, only 22.4% of the stimulus had been spent. The package had been split between health and economic recovery programmes ranging from corporate tax exemptions to food and cash aid for households.
David Sumual, Bank Central Asia's chief economist, said that unless the stimulus was disbursed faster the economy risked contracting this year for the first time since 1998.
""Government spending is the only driver of growth right now, especially social programmes,"" Sumual said.
Just 39% of the 2,739 trillion rupiah ($189 billion) state budget, which includes the stimulus, was spent in the first half of 2020, down from 42% at the same time last year.
In two videos released by his office, President Joko Widodo rebuked ministers for not spending faster.
But ministries are now beginning to focus on finalising next year's budget.
The World Bank has welcomed Indonesia's COVID-19 social programmes, about a third of the stimulus, but said minimal leakage and swift implementation was needed to curb the risk of 5.5 million to 8 million new poor being created. 
Around 25 million of Indonesia's 267 million people currently exist below the national poverty line and were living on around $1 a day, the World Bank said.
A flower seller at a cemetery in Padang in West Sumatra, told Reuters last month that his income had collapsed and he had yet to receive government aid.
""We eat what we can. All of our small savings we use to buy rice, eggs and milk for the kids,"" said Fauzan, 70, who uses one name and is the breadwinner for four family members.
A survey by pollster Indikator Politik published in June showed 60% of Indonesians thought welfare programmes had not reached intended recipients and only 4% were satisfied.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati has cited challenges to spending such as red tape and social restrictions amid the pandemic. Indrawati on Wednesday detailed money spent so far on health programmes and tax incentives, but said financial support was yet to reach companies.

Authorities would reallocate $5 billion to assisting 10 million poor families and 12 million micro-businesses, while cash transfers for workers earning below $344 a month were also being considered, she said.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's central bank unexpectedly kept interest rates on hold on Thursday, amid a recent rise in retail consumer prices, and said it would ensure inflation remains within its target range.
The repo rate  currently stands at 4.0% and the reverse repo rate  at 3.35%.
Two-thirds of analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted a 25 basis point cut in the repo rate, while the rest saw no change. 
The Reserve Bank of India has already reduced the repo rate by a total of 115 basis points since February, on top of the 135 basis points in an easing cycle last year, from 6.50%.
""Given the uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook and extremely weak state of the economy in the midst of an unprecedented shock from the ongoing pandemic, the MPC decided to keep the policy rate on hold,"" Governor Shaktikanta Das said. 
Das said the central bank would remain ""watchful for a durable reduction in inflation to use the available space to support the revival of the economy.""
The committee, however, unanimously decided to continue to keep its accommodative policy stance ""as long as necessary to revive growth"".
The country was placed under one of the strictest lockdowns in the world in late March for more than two months to halt the spread of the coronavirus. The government gradually eased restrictions in June although infections continue to rise.
A Reuters poll estimates the economy could contract 20% in the June quarter versus the April forecast of a 5.2% fall and remain in negative terrain until the December quarter.

For the full year 2020-21, the economy is likely to shrink 5.1%, which would be its weakest performance since 1979, a sharp contrast to the 1.5% expansion forecast in April.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's banks hold enough capital to keep on lending to the country's companies and also to absorb billions in losses likely to arise due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank of England said.
Companies could suffer a cash flow deficit of up to 200 billion pounds ($263 billion), and banks could be hit by credit losses of less than 80 billion pounds, the BoE's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) said on Thursday.
""It remains the FPC’s judgement that banks have the capacity, and it is in the collective interest of the banking system, to continue to support businesses and households through this period,"" the FPC said in its Financial Stability Report.
""That said, the banking system cannot be resilient to all possible outcomes ― there are inevitably very severe economic outcomes that would challenge banks’ ability to lend.""
But there would be costs to banks and the wider economy from taking ""defensive actions"" like scaling back on lending.
Separately, the BoE said it expected Britain's economy to take longer to get back to its pre-COVID-19 pandemic size.
The FPC said a ""reverse stress test"" of lenders showed that to deplete their capital ratios by more than 5 percentage points, banks would need to incur credit impairments of around 120 billion pounds.
It would require the cumulative loss of economic output due to COVID-19 to be twice as big as the Bank's central economic projection to incur such losses, the FPC report said.
The FPC has been asked by the finance ministry to review whether changes are needed to Britain's financial system, including regulation, to improve the flow of finance to all parts of Britain.
Britain's government has said it wants to ""level up"" the regions where investment and productivity lags that of London.
""The FPC intends to focus on examining possible distortions to the supply of illiquid long-term and equity-like investments,"" the report said.
Although Britain left the European Union in January and transition arrangements end in December with no new UK-EU trade deal yet in place, the report said ""most risks to UK financial stability that could arise from disruption to cross-border financial services have been mitigated"".

This was the case ""even if the current transition period ends without the UK and EU agreeing specific arrangements for financial services,"" it added.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand has delayed plans for a ""travel bubble"" agreement with select countries as new daily coronavirus cases rise in parts of Asia, putting pressure on its vital tourism industry and complicating efforts to revive its battered economy. 
Thailand first proposed the idea in June to allow movement between select countries that have low infection numbers, without the need for travellers to undergo quarantine.
But that has been shelved, officials said, amid second and third waves in East Asian countries that previously had their outbreaks under control. 
""We are delaying discussion of travel bubble arrangements for now given the outbreak situation in other countries,"" Thailand's coronavirus taskforce spokesman, Taweesin Wisanuyothin, told Reuters.
Despite more than two months without confirmed local transmission and recording only 3,300 cases, Southeast Asia's second-largest economy is facing its worst crisis in several decades. 
Foreign arrivals plunged 66% in the first six months of the year, to 6.69 million. The industry has warned that 1.6 trillion baht ($51.50 billion) of revenue could be wiped out this year.
By comparison, Thailand had a record 39.8 million tourists in all of 2019, spending 1.93 trillion baht. 
""Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea were among those considered (for a travel bubble) because those areas had a low number of cases, but now they were in double-digits so discussions were put on hold,"" Taweesin said, referring to new daily infections.
Reviving talks would depend on the situation in each country, which the taskforce was assessing daily, he said, adding that was a widely accepted industry view. 
The island of Phuket has instead proposed receiving direct flights from those countries, with tourists and business executives doing two-week quarantines in their hotels before going out.
""We are asking for travel, charter flights, into Phuket,"" Phuket Tourist Association President Bhummikitti Ruktaengam, told Reuters.
Although demand for long stays would be lower, it would be a start, with occupancy of 40% to 50% sufficient for hotels to survive and avert job losses, Bhummikitti added.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog is stepping up its vigilance of credit providers who encourage customers to take on more loans than they can afford, putting them at risk of a personal debt spiral that could ramp up their financial difficulties.
In a review of the high cost credit market published on Thursday, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it was worried about firms' conduct, including poor practice in use of online accounts, apps and marketing messages that emphasised ease, convenience and benefits of taking on more credit.
The study, which was completed prior to the coronavirus pandemic, also showed that nearly half of consumers regretted borrowing more money while some had missed payments and were forced to prioritise repayment of debt over other expenses.
""We have significant concerns that repeat borrowing could be a strong indicator of levels of debt that are harmful to the customer,"" Jonathan Davidson, Executive Director of Supervision, Retail and Authorisations, said.
The FCA has described the fair and efficient running of credit markets for vulnerable borrowers as one of its key priorities, highlighting concerns about the increased costs of refinancing compared with other ways of accessing new credit.
Before the pandemic, it saw increasing numbers of complaints about high-cost lenders' relending practices and affordability assessment failures, which suggested some were not relending in a way that was sustainable for customers, Davidson said.
""We expect firms to review their relending practices in light of our findings as they start to lend again, and to make any necessary changes to improve customer outcomes,"" he said, adding that the FCA would take action where it saw harm.
The FCA reviewed the borrowing history of around 250,000 customers, a sample of firms' loan books to analyse how much relending is taking place; and firms' marketing materials, to understand how firms promote relending to existing customers.
Some academic studies since the pandemic suggest borrowers with stronger credit profiles might also be at risk, as lenders push products they don't need to offset losses on relief lending to poorer customers that are only partly covered by the state.

""Banks have a record of engaging in 'window dressing' and 'profit pumping'. If government guarantees will be partial or remain uncertain, banks will find ways to cope with even worse implications for the economy,"" Massimo Massa, Professor of Finance at INSEAD, said.

MONTERREY, Mexico (Reuters) - Ministers from a trans-Pacific trade bloc have agreed to fight protectionism and avoid food and medicine shortages during the coronavirus pandemic, they said in a joint statement published on Wednesday.
""We strongly believe that given the current circumstances, it is more important than ever to counter protectionism,"" said the statement, released after a virtual ministerial meeting of the 11 members hosted by Mexico. 
It also expressed support for modernizing the World Trade Organization (WTO), and said it supported expanding the bloc by adding new members. 
The Comprehensive and Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. 
Together they have a combined economy of $13.5 trillion.
The pandemic has exacerbated a trend towards protectionism on the global stage, with a number of European countries taking steps to favor domestic investments, and ongoing saber-rattling between the United States and China.
Lockdowns around the world temporarily shattered the web of suppliers central to modern manufacturing. 
""I am convinced we must take action to strengthen existing regional supply chains and to develop new ones"" in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, Mexican economic minister Graciela Marquez said in her speech that inaugurated the meeting.
The joint statement, issued by the Mexican economy ministry, said open and connected supply chains play ""an instrumental role in avoiding food shortages and ensuring global food security."" 
The members pledged to ""facilitate the flow of essential goods and services during the pandemic, including medical supplies and equipment.""
""21ST CENTURY ISSUES""
The statement said the WTO should demonstrate an ability to deliver ""outcomes on 21st century issues,"" in an apparent dig at the global trade organization's more than decade-long deadlock in trade negotiations. 
The world's two largest economies are not members of the CPTPP bloc, which was established in part as a counterweight to China's growing clout. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement soon after he took office in 2017.
Other countries want in, including the United Kingdom, which is keen to strike new trading partnerships after its exit from the European Union. 
Britain's ambassador to Mexico, Corin Robertson, said the process of accession would take time and no major announcements were expected about the matter during the ministerial meeting.
""It's still very much our intent to join CPTPP. We see it as a great opportunity for the UK as part of a more ambitious trade agenda post-Brexit,"" Robertson told Reuters on Wednesday. 
Japanese Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told the video conference that Tokyo would welcome new members in the bloc. 

""As a matter of principle, Japan welcomes those economies who are willing to meet the high standards of the agreement,"" he told the meeting.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan said on Thursday that overly focusing on what sovereign rating agencies think can take one's eyes off what needs to be done for the economy.
""It is also important to convince both domestic and international investors that after the crisis associated with the pandemic is over, we will return to fiscal responsibility over the medium term, and the government should do more to convince them of that,"" Rajan told the Global Markets Forum.
India was placed under one of the strictest lockdowns in the world in late March for more than two months to stem the spread of the coronavirus, but cases have continued to rise steadily since the government eased restrictions in June, stymieing hopes of an economic recovery. 
The government has announced several initiatives to help the poor and small- and medium-size businesses, but actual cash outgo from the government's measures has been estimated at just about 1% of GDP.
Several attribute the fiscal prudence to fear of a downgrade after Moody's (NYSE:MCO) cut India's rating and outlook in early June followed closely by a change in outlook from Fitch.
The central bank on its part too has reduced the key lending rate by 115 basis points on top of the 135 bps last year and is widely expected to cut rates by another 25 bps later on Thursday.
""The RBI and government have certainly been cooperating, but it seems like it is elsewhere, the ball is in the government's court to do more,"" Rajan said.
He said the RBI needs to focus on whether credit is reaching the stressed areas of the economy and also if the viable firms were able to access credit and not the unviable ones. 
""And I think that's where it has to focus its attentions, because resources, as you well know, are limited in India today.""
Recently analysts, however, have cited the growing possibility the RBI may prefer to pause and cut rates only at its October meeting.
Government officials too have suggested the possibility of any more fiscal stimulus being announced, would only come in the second half of the fiscal year, once a recovery has taken root and coronavirus cases have peaked.
""What India should focus on at this point is protecting its economic capabilities, so that when it has dealt with the virus it can go resume activity in a reasonable way. That should be the focus,"" Rajan said.
""And if it does that, there is no reason why the rating agencies will not see that as an appropriate policy"".

1373,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 02:40AM ET</span>",Australia's second-biggest city enters strict new coronavirus lockdown,"By Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's second-biggest city Melbourne began the first day of a six-week total lockdown on Thursday with the closure of most shops and businesses raising new fears of food shortages, as authorities battle a second wave of coronavirus infections.
Shops were shut and streets were deserted in the city of about 5 million people, the capital of Victoria state, which reported 471 new COVID-19 cases and eight deaths in the past 24 hours.
Australia has now recorded about 20,000 COVID-19 cases and 255 fatalities, still far fewer than many other developed nations.
But the Victorian outbreak threatens to spill into other states. New South Wales reported 12 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, taking the national tally to 483. There were no cases reported in other states and territories
""We've flattened that curve once, we'll flatten that curve again,"" Health Minister Greg Hunt told reporters.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews urged Melbourne residents, who have already endured weeks of less severe lockdown, to stay calm amid a surge in demand at supermarkets.
""There's no need for people to be trying to stockpile months and months of food,"" Andrews told reporters in Melbourne.
Abattoirs are one of the few businesses allowed to stay open in Melbourne, though with a reduced workforce, under the ""stage four"" lockdown which took effect at midnight on Wednesday. 
""We have tried to get that balance between reducing the amount of movement, therefore reducing the number of cases, but not compromising what you need being on the supermarket shelves,"" Andrews added.
Forecast national peak unemployment was revised upwards to about 10% due to Victoria's reimposition of restrictions, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. Counting those workers on Australia’s wage subsidy scheme, Morrison said effective unemployment would be closer to 14%.
""These measures will have a very significant cost, and it will impact the recovery path,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra.
Australia had previously forecast unemployment would hit a high of 9.25% this year, as the economy endures its first recession in three decades. 
After closing its international borders early, locking down cities and launching a campaign of mass virus testing, Australia had reopened in June with daily cases in the single figures. 
But hidden transmissions among staff at quarantine centres led to wider community transmissions in Victoria, which has recorded triple-digit new cases for weeks. 
Victoria now has the bulk of Australia's infections, with more than 13,000 reported cases. It reported a daily high of 725 new cases and 15 deaths on Wednesday.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Even with unemployment spiking as the coronavirus pandemic swept South Korea in February, Baek Seung-min asked his wife to quit her nursing job to help reach a dream they had spent a lifetime chasing: buying their own apartment.
The 35-year-old interior designer said giving up his wife's 58 million won ($48,000) salary would improve their chances of securing a property after the government introduced a host of measures aimed at cooling rampant property prices. 
The unusual plan was to cut his wife's income for a while so the couple's annual earnings were low enough to be eligible for a quota system in new property developments designed to give more low-income newlyweds access to housing.
Even so, Baek and his wife decided to settle two hours west of his Seoul workplace in Incheon, where borrowing rules were looser and apartments far cheaper. 
""Seoul home prices grew way out of reach, we had to go all the way to Incheon to buy our place,"" Baek said. ""The government is crushing our dreams when they curb loans and tell us not to buy homes, it enrages me.""
Despite more than 20 cooling policies introduced by President Moon Jae-in’s government, home prices in Seoul have risen more than 50% since 2017, the fastest pace in the world, according to statistics site Numbeo. 
The surge has dashed the hopes of many young families and signalled that the ""middle class contract"" that helped build Asia’s fourth-largest economy may have slipped out of reach. 
(GRAPHIC - Surging Seoul homes: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/xklpydbkxvg/eikon.png) 
ANGER AT INEQUALITY 
When the left-leaning Moon took office in 2017, his central promise was to create a level playing field for all South Koreans and a society where hardworking people could raise a family and afford a home.
But tighter mortgage rules featuring vastly lower loan-to-value ratios, along with various tax penalties to discourage speculative transactions, are contributing to higher rents and larger down payment requirements - hurting those the policies are intended to help.
Mortgage rules for Seoul now cap borrowing at 40% of the value of the home. Pockets of the glitzy suburb of Gangnam are also subject to a transaction permit system, meaning sales without a permit can be made invalid if a purchase is considered ""speculative"".
Critics say such policies mean the ""gold spoon"" children of the wealthy can snap up the best homes with their cash, leaving ""dirt spoons"" trapped as second-class citizens - fuelling the inequality Moon promised to tackle.
While some families are cutting their incomes to improve their chances of getting a boost onto the property ladder, others are getting divorced on paper to reduce real estate taxes or not registering their marriage to keep separate home-buying applications, according to two lawyers and a tax accountant Reuters spoke to.
Anger at Moon's economic policies has wiped out a surge in his approval ratings from the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, slipping back to a near nine-month low of 44.5%, according to a Real Meter survey on Thursday. 
The Presidential Blue House declined to comment for this article. 
On Tuesday, Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said stabilising home prices was the government's biggest public welfare policy goal as plans were announced to add more than 132,000 new homes in Seoul through 2028.
MIDDLE CLASS TICKET 
For decades following the 1950-53 Korean War, South Koreans saw a degree from a top university and an apartment in Seoul as the fastest way to the middle class, which explains why about three-quarters of household wealth is concentrated in real estate. 
But now, ""dirt spoons"" who studied hard and secured white-collar jobs such as lawyers and interior designers say the cooling measures Moon introduced have made it impossible for them to buy a property in Seoul even with a six-figure salary. 
It now takes an average Korean household more than 14 years of income to buy an average Seoul home, assuming zero expenses. It was 11 years when Moon took office, KB Bank data shows. 
Hong Na-ri, a lawyer who rents a three-bedder with her twin daughters and husband in Seoul, says her family is priced out of the property market. 
The price of the flat Hong has been renting in Seoul's Songpa neighbourhood has more than doubled to 1.8 billion won since she moved to the area in 2015. 
""When I got married (in 2015) I believed prices will go down…now everyone asks me why didn't buy one when I could. It makes me anxious, but there is nothing I can do,"" said the 35-year-old, whose combined household income ranges from $6,700-$10,000 a month.
""It's not like I can move outside of Seoul, away from our babysitter, preschool, and my job."" 
Moon is trying to fix structural problems in the economy.
He has sought to rein in the powerful chaebol conglomerates such as Samsung (KS:005930) and Hyundai, which have seen their profits far outstrip household income growth. Tighter mortgage rules were introduced because the easier credit available under his predecessor was blamed for initially stoking the housing bubble.
Yun Chang-hyun, a conservative economist and member of parliament for the opposition United Future Party, says the government's approach is creating more uncertainty about future.

""More than 20 separate set of measures without success has caused stress and anxiety among people they must buy something now or never.""

Indonesia reported on Wednesday gross domestic product contracted 5.32% in the second quarter as household consumption, which accounts for more than half of the economy, fell 5.51% from a year earlier.
""The government's aim by pouring additional income is to support household consumption, which is important to propel the economy and pushing for economic improvement,"" State-owned Enterprise minister Erick Thohir said on Thursday.
Thohir said in the statement workers on a monthly income of below 5 million rupiah ($343.64) would receive about $41 a month for four months starting September.
Thohir, who is chairing a COVID-19 recovery task force, said non-government officers as well as employees of state-owned companies registered with the worker's social security provider BPJS Ketenagakerjaan would be eligible.

Finance Minister Sri Mulyani on Wednesday put the cost of the programme at about 31.2 trillion rupiah ($2.15 billion) and said it was part of efforts to speed up disbursement of the government's COVID-19 stimulus by reallocating parts of the $50 billion programme to more practical use.

By Steve Gorman
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. losses from coronavirus-related fraud and identity theft have reached nearly $100 million since the pandemic emerged in March, while complaints of COVID-19 scams have at least doubled in most states, a consumer protection group said on Tuesday.
A report from the group, based on government data, highlighted the vast scope of a fast-growing criminal cottage industry - from phony stimulus-check offers to shopping scams and fake cures - preying on Americans already distressed by the pandemic and its economic fallout.
Perhaps not surprisingly, the study found California, Florida, New York, Texas and Pennsylvania - the most populous of the 50 U.S. states - to be the five most targeted by coronavirus scams in the country.
Together they accounted for about a third of more than 150,000 instances of COVID-related fraud reported nationally by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from mid-March, when the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic, through July, the report https://socialcatfish.com/blog/coronavirus-scams-how-covid-19-stimulus-check-scams-shopping-scams-have-evolved-since-march-2020 showed.
Those cases have cost victims a total of $97.5 million to date, according to the FTC.
Even relatively small states saw huge spikes in COVID-related fraud in recent months, led by Maine, whose monthly complaints of coronavirus scams and identity theft quadrupled between March and July, the study said.
The report was published by the internet-based group SocialCatfish.com, which helps consumers avoid being defrauded online by determining the true identity of individuals or organizations hiding behind a phony persona.
Scams taking advantage of Americans' desperation in the midst of a deadly pandemic and accompanying economic upheaval ""are running rampant,"" said Richard Neil, a spokesman for the report's authors.
Several newly flourishing forms of fraud involve fake promises of government stimulus checks, often perpetuated through ""robocalls,"" texts, or emails seeking personal and financial information the caller supposedly needs to deposit benefits into the victim's account, according to the report.

Price-gouging and other consumer product scams have also become widespread, the study warned.

1380,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 07:40PM ET</span>","White House, congressional Democrats harden stances on coronavirus relief","By Patricia Zengerle and Susan Cornwell
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top congressional Democrats and White House officials appeared to harden their stances on new coronavirus relief legislation on Wednesday, as negotiations headed toward an end-of-week deadline with no sign of an agreement.
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters after nearly two hours of talks that Democrats were determined to reach agreement on a legislative package but only if it met the needs of an American public reeling from months of restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of infections. 
Another key negotiator, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, told CNN that President Donald Trump stood ready to take unilateral action on pressing issues such as unemployment benefits and protection from evictions if the talks cannot produce agreement.
""If Congress can't get it done, the president of the United States will,"" he told CNN.
The two sides remained trillions of dollars apart in their negotiating positions after more than a week of discussions between Pelosi, Meadows, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.
Senate Republicans have been told that negotiators have until Friday to reach agreement. ""If there's not a deal by Friday, there won't be a deal,"" Republican Senator Roy Blunt told reporters.
But Mnuchin played down the idea of Friday as a make-or-break point. 
""I don't want to describe this as an end-of-week deadline. What I want to say is that we set an objective, to see if we can deal with the major issues by Friday,"" he told reporters. 
Pelosi also suggested flexibility on timing. ""I feel optimistic that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, but how long that tunnel is remains to be seen,"" she said.
Negotiators have already blown past one deadline: last Friday, when enhanced unemployment payments of $600 a week expired for the tens of millions of Americans who have lost their jobs in the pandemic.
FALLING INTO PLACE 
Trump said he was considering unilateral action to stimulate the economy by allowing taxpayers to defer payroll tax payments - a proposal that has gained no traction among lawmakers of either party.
""I have the right to suspend it, and I may do it myself,"" he said in an interview with Fox News. ""I have the absolute right to suspend the payroll.""
Before Trump acts, Mnuchin said negotiators would aim for compromise on some big issues, adding that there is already a series of topics on which the sides have reached or neared agreement. 
""If we can reach a compromise on these big issues, I think everything else will fall into place. If we can't reach an agreement on these big issues, then I don't see us coming to an overall deal. And then we'll have to look at the president taking actions,"" Mnuchin told reporters.
Mnuchin has warned that the Trump administration would not accept ""anything close"" to the $3.4 trillion in new aid sought by Democrats. But he offered to extend through the end of the year an expired moratorium on evictions of people unable to pay their rent.
Mitch McConnell, the Senate's top Republican, who has not joined the negotiations, did not draw as hard a line as Mnuchin or some fellow Republican Senators.
""We'll certainly be in next week. We'll see what happens after that,"" McConnell said. Even if the White House and Democratic negotiations agree on a deal, it will take time to draw up legislative language and summon members for a vote.
Some of McConnell's Republicans last week rebelled against his $1 trillion proposal, which would have significantly reduced the enhanced jobless benefit.
In May, the Democratic-controlled House passed a $3 trillion aid bill that included around $1 trillion to help state and local governments that have revenue shortfalls because of the huge slowdown in economic activity related to the pandemic.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, speaking on behalf of all U.S. governors, urged Congress to include $500 billion in unrestricted state funding.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A resurgence in coronavirus cases is slowing the economic recovery and the pandemic will continue to weigh on the U.S. economy and American life for longer than initially expected, three Federal Reserve policymakers said on Wednesday.
The U.S. economy began to grow in May and June after taking a monumental hit beginning in March. But growth stalled in July as infections spiked in some parts of the country, leading to fresh restrictions, U.S. central bankers said. 
""The issue with the resurgence in the virus is it slowed down or somewhat muted the recovery we’ve been expecting,"" Robert Kaplan, the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank president, said in an interview with CNN. 
The increase in infections has raised the downside risks to the economic outlook and suggests the reopening of the U.S. economy may be more protracted than many initially anticipated, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said in a speech for the Liberal Arts Macroeconomics Conference. 
The rising case load offers ""a stark reminder that there are several different scenarios that could play out,"" Mester said.
Jobless Americans and state and local governments will need more aid to make it through the crisis, Kaplan said. Lawmakers missed a deadline last week for extending a $600 weekly supplement to state unemployment benefits, and are in the midst of negotiating another round of stimulus.
""I believe the economy needs a continuation of the unemployment benefits,"" Kaplan said. ""It may not need to be in the same form as it currently is, but we need a continuation.""
Mester also said more fiscal support is needed to bolster struggling businesses, households and consumers, and she said she was hopeful that Congress will pass a stimulus bill. 
""The country has a responsibility to help them over that, to bridge that period, until we can get the economy going again,"" Mester said during the webinar.
While U.S. economic growth slowed in July, it could pick up in the third quarter and reach pre-pandemic levels by the end of next year, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said on CNBC. 
""It will take some time, I believe, before we get back to the level of activity that we were in February before the pandemic hit,"" Clarida said. 
Clarida said his personal forecast for the economy hasn't changed because of the recent resurgence of the virus in the United States, since the economic momentum from May through early July was stronger than he expected. He also expects support from another fiscal package should even things out. 
Kaplan forecast that for the 2020 full year, the economy will contract by 5%, while Mester forecast a contraction of 6%, from the end of 2019.
Fed officials pledged at their policy meeting last week to do what they can to help the economy rebound from the recession that began in February as the coronavirus outbreak spread across the globe. The U.S. central bank has cut interest rates to near zero and rolled out roughly a dozen emergency programs to backstop financial markets and support businesses. 
Asked about the tepid use of the Fed's Main Street Lending Program, which is designed to help small and mid-sized businesses, Clarida said the facilities are meant to serve as backstops and that officials are open to changing the program if needed to reach more businesses.
""I do expect activity in the program to pick up,"" Clarida said. ""We're focused on the goal of supporting the economy and if we need to adjust our programs we will do so.""

Mester also said Wednesday that she supports making more adjustments to the Fed's facilities if needed. ""Given the nature of this shock to the economy, I'd be prepared to take more credit risk than I would have been in the past,” Mester told reporters.

1382,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 07:15PM ET</span>",Bank of England set to sit tight on COVID stimulus for now,"By William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England looks set to hold off from taking further action to help Britain's economy through the coronavirus pandemic on Thursday as it waits to see the scale of an expected surge in unemployment.
The central bank is expected to announce at 0600 GMT that it is keeping its benchmark interest rate at an all-time low of 0.1% and its bond-buying stimulus programme unchanged at 745 billion pounds ($980 billion).
Most attention will be on the Monetary Policy Committee's outlook for the economy, details of how sharply it will slow its bond purchases, and its latest thinking on the pros and cons of taking borrowing costs below zero.
In May the MPC said the world's sixth-biggest economy might get back to its pre-pandemic size in the second half of next year, but since then the signs of recovery have been mixed.
Britain's budget forecasters say unemployment will probably jump to 12% by the end of the year, three times its most recent rate and higher than the BoE's estimate in May.
A government job subsidy programme is being wound down from this month and is due to close completely in October.
Furthermore, many Britons remain worried about the risks of catching COVID-19, frustrating attempts by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to get them back into their workplaces, leaving the centre of many big cities almost deserted.
Some economists think it could be years before the economy returns to its previous size.
However, there have been signs that consumers are spending at least some of the money they saved during lockdown: Car sales rose for the first time this year in July, and diners have taken advantage of a state subsidy for eating out.
The housing market - central to confidence in Britain - has picked up after its shutdown in April and May.
Howard Archer, an economist with EY Item Club, said the BoE probably felt it could stick with its plan to stretch the latest 100 billion-pound increase of its bond-buying programme until around the end of the year, when another expansion was likely.
Bond investors will be watching for details of the pace of those bond purchases.
Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said the BoE might say that interest rates could go lower than their current level just above zero, but ""we do not expect any urgency in the MPC's intention to actually cut into negative territory"".

While COVID-19 has forced policymakers around the world into emergency action, Britain faces the extra risk of a Brexit shock when a no-change period for its trade with the European Union expires at the end of 2020. No new deal has yet been reached.

The letter by Jim Banks is addressed to Small Business Administrator Jovita Carranza and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, tasked with overseeing the Paycheck Protection Program. 
That program, which loans money to firms to encourage them to retain employees during the coronavirus-related shutdown, has drawn fire for technical glitches, a lack of transparency and for doling out funds to large companies with ample access to credit. 
Banks called for the probe, citing loans to companies whose Chinese parents, including aircraft manufacturer Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) [SASADY.UL] and weapons maker China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC), were recently designated as owned or controlled by the Chinese military by the U.S. Defense Department.
""China's activity in ... defense and aerospace, presents a direct and present threat to America's national security. These companies' entire mission is to make America less secure,"" Banks wrote in the letter dated Wednesday. ""A review of the ... loans to firms affiliated with the PLA is warranted.""
The companies include Continental Aerospace Technologies Inc, which is owned by AVIC and received $5 million to 10 million from the program. It also includes Honghua America LLC, the U.S.- based subsidiary of Chinese drill rig manufacturer Honghua Group, which is in turn owned by CASIC. Honghua received up to $1 million, according to SBA data.
Continental and Honghua did not immediately respond to requests for comment and the SBA declined to comment. A Treasury Department representative confirmed receipt of the letter but declined to comment further. 
Banks also cites a report suggesting that over 125 Chinese companies obtained up to $419 million through the lending program. 

""It's unacceptable for the Chinese Communist Party to receive taxpayer funds intended to relieve American businesses from a crisis that the CCP significantly worsened,"" he added.

The central bank, led by its President Roberto Campos Neto, on Wednesday lowered the benchmark Selic to 2% following back-to-back reductions of 75 basis points, as forecast by 33 of 37 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The other four analysts expected borrowing costs to remain steady.
The bank is striking a more cautious tone as it delivers a ninth straight rate cut to mitigate the economic collapse from the pandemic. Consumer prices are seen below target until 2022 as rising unemployment and an ongoing virus outbreak keep demand in check. Yet policy makers are also monitoring the risk that the unprecedented level of public spending during the crisis could be extended into the next year, possibly fueling inflation.
“The fiscal outlook is uncertain, and that’s a reason for them to observe the effects of the easing,” Newton Rosa, chief economist at Sul America Investimentos Dtvm, said before the rate decision. “The central bank indicated it will be more cautious in its assessment of activity and other economic indicators.”
The coronavirus has forced President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration to postpone plans to cut debt and boost fiscal accounts. Instead, the government is ramping up emergency expenditures with proposals that may include an extension of popular, yet costly, monthly stipends for informal workers.

Some states have hit pause on their plans to reopen businesses and imposed new restrictions after seeing infections rise, Mester said, a trend that is causing consumers to cut back on spending.
""The reopening phase has proved to be challenging,"" Mester said in remarks prepared for a virtual event on Wednesday. ""Thus, the reopening phase may be more protracted than many had anticipated when it started.""
A review of high-frequency data and discussions with regional contacts show that U.S. economic activity is slowing, Mester said. For example, she said, spending on services, including money spent on travel and dining, remains well below pre-pandemic levels despite increasing in May and June.
Mester said she expects the unemployment rate to remain elevated at around 9% at the end of 2020. She projects that economic output will decline by 6% compared with the end of 2019. 

""The uncertainty around this forecast is extremely high. We are in an unprecedented situation and outcomes depend not only on appropriate economic policy but also on public health considerations,"" she said.

1389,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 03:18PM ET</span>","Housing, Auto Demand Are Rare Standouts in a Shaky U.S. Recovery","(Bloomberg) -- The elixir of record-low interest rates has helped revive the U.S. markets for housing and autos -- standouts in an economy in desperate need of traction.
Sales of new homes in June ran at their fastest pace in nearly 13 years, leaving builders and the construction workers they employ with bigger backlogs. While the motor-vehicle industry still isn’t back to pre-pandemic levels, the pace of car and light-truck purchases accelerated a third straight month to an annualized pace of 14.5 million in July, exceeding economists’ estimates.
These are bright spots that President Donald Trump has touted, though with the coronavirus maintaining its grip on activity, the economic recovery will probably prove more uneven. A report Wednesday from ADP Research Institute showed a marked slowdown in hiring during July that suggested the pace of growth is leveling off.
Auto sales “are a key factor in the resurgence of manufacturing,” Trump said at a White House briefing on Tuesday. “The need to restock depleted shelves will further galvanize the factory sector -- and, we think, very substantially, based on the numbers.”
The turnaround in interest-sensitive sectors also coincides with employment rebounds in those industries at a time when some states are dialing back reopenings in a more direct threat to restaurants, hotels and retailers.
“When you think about it, the only thing carrying the economy for the next year or so is going to be consumption and residential investment,” said Christopher Low, chief economist at FHN Financial. “Cars and housing are a vital part of both of those.”
The following charts show how housing and auto manufacturing, through direct and secondary effects on the economy, are in a unique position to underpin the recovery until a coronavirus vaccine bolsters consumer and business confidence.
The coronavirus-induced shutdowns didn’t keep the housing market down for long. Helped by the Federal Reserve’s quick reduction of its benchmark lending rate, mortgages became more affordable and sales responded in suit. Housing is also benefiting from an exodus from urban areas to suburbs.
“The recovery in new-home demand that we experienced over the course of the second quarter was nothing short of outstanding,” Ryan Marshall, chief executive officer at PulteGroup Inc (NYSE:PHM)., said on the company’s July 23 earnings call. “Led by strong demand among first-time buyers, we saw meaningful improvement across all buyer groups and geographies as the quarter advanced.” And it continued into early July, he said.
Now, builders are facing a backlog that’s on par with levels seen some 13 years ago, indicating plenty of work ahead and more hiring.
Since the April low for employment, payrolls have increased more than 10% in both the residential building and the residential specialty-trade categories, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Jobs in those two areas are only about 5% shy of pre-pandemic levels.
“If we start building more homes, particularly single-family homes, that will create three to four jobs per home built,” said Ryan Sweet, head of monetary policy research at Moody’s Analytics.
“It’s great that there are certain parts of the economy that are doing well, and that’s not atypical in and around a recession with early recoveries, but the heart of the economy -- small businesses, consumer services -- those are the ones that have delivered an enormous blow, and it’s going to take time for them to come back,” Sweet said.
Employment in the motor-vehicle industry has soared some 37% since April as automakers strove to get production lines back to capacity, though it’s down 12% from February, before the economic shutdowns. While leisure and hospitality jobs have come back faster, employment in those areas could well begin to fall again as the virus continues to disrupt.
Manufacturer incentives and to a lesser extent, more older vehicles on the road, are combining to lift sales at a time when inventories are running lean. Dhivya Suryadevara, chief financial officer at General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)., said on the company’s July 29 earnings call that inventory stood at 480,000 units as of July 25, down from 810,000 at the end of the second quarter in 2019.
“We continue to take a number of actions to increase production and replenish dealer inventories,” Suryadevara said. “We have returned to a normalized run rate in all of our full-size truck plants and are matching supply with demand in our remaining facilities.”
The latest survey of manufacturers by the Institute for Supply Management showed lean inventories may be more commonplace throughout the economy. The share of purchasing managers at factories who say their customers’ stockpiles are too low was the second-highest in a decade.
Should demand not succumb to various state government pullbacks on their economies, orders and production should continue to pick up. Nonetheless, corporate leaders say they remain cautiously optimistic about the economy through at least the remainder of the year as the health crisis continues to bubble.

""I believe the economy needs a continuation of the unemployment benefits,"" Kaplan said during an interview with CNN. ""It may not need to be in the same form as it currently is, but we need a continuation.""
Kaplan declined to say exactly how much aid he thinks lawmakers should provide, but he said the support, along with widespread use of masks, is critical to helping the economy recover.
He projected that U.S. GDP will grow at an annualized rate of 20% in the third quarter, but still expects the U.S. economy to contract by about 5% for the year. 
The Fed official said the pace of the recovery will depend on the virus. Kaplan said further shutdowns may be needed in some parts of the country if it appears healthcare systems are at risk of becoming overwhelmed, and emphasized that widespread use of masks can help bring infections down to a more manageable level. 

""The issue with the resurgence in the virus is it slowed down or somewhat muted the recovery we’ve been expecting,"" Kaplan said. ""So the better again we manage the virus, the better we’ll recover.""

1391,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 01:18PM ET</span>",Democrats Propose Requiring Fed to Reduce Inequality Across U.S.,"(Bloomberg) -- Democrats in Congress introduced a bill Tuesday that would cement the Federal Reserve’s role in fighting economic inequality.
The Federal Reserve Racial and Economic Equity Act would amend the Federal Reserve Act and mandate that the U.S. central bank specifically work to decrease and eliminate gaps in employment, wages, wealth and access to credit. It would also require the central bank to report on racial disparities and how it’s working to decrease them in its biannual reports to Congress and in the Fed chair’s accompanying testimony.
Although the bill has little chance of passing through Congress while the Senate is controlled by Republicans, its introduction shows that momentum is building to get the country’s century-old central bank to more specifically focus on creating an economy that is equal for all Americans. A November win for Joe Biden and his Democrats that gave them control of the White house and both chambers of Congress could also change the calculus.
“Building on the great work of civil rights leader Coretta Scott King and others who led the way for the adoption of the Fed’s full employment mandate, the Federal Reserve Racial and Economic Equity Act creates a new racial justice mission at the Fed to eliminate racial and economic disparities in all of its work,” Representative Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT) said in a statement.
The bill was introduced by Waters, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand and was signed on by 17 other Democrats.
‘Disparate Distributional Outcomes’
The Biden campaign called for a similar proposal last week. Economists Jared Bernstein and Janelle Jones have called on the Fed to target the Black unemployment rate when it makes policy decisions in order to narrow the gap between White and Black unemployment.
The difference between the rates has been persistently high, with the Black rate often more than double the White one. Black families also have one-tenth the wealth of White families, indicating systemic problems in the economy that continue to hamper upward mobility and opportunity for millions of Americans.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in May that the Fed’s policies do not exacerbate inequality. He said last week that the central bank doesn’t have the tools to address “disparate distributional outcomes” and indicated that fiscal policies may be better suited to address these problems in the economy. He has, however, said that the Fed has learned that it can run the economy hotter than thought without sparking unwanted inflation, and as a result the benefits of a tight labor market can be extended to poorer and minority communities.

1392,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>","Brazil unemployment, end of emergency aid threaten economic recovery","By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Expiring emergency payments to millions of low-paid Brazilians and the likely restoration of growth-choking austerity measures, as unemployment rises, risk torpedoing growing optimism that Latin America's economy may not tank as much as feared.
The average forecast for 2020 gross domestic product is now showing a decline of 5.7%, a weekly central bank survey of economists on Monday showed, milder than the 6.5% drop seen a month previous. 
The improvement is widely chalked up to the stronger-than-expected impact of 600 reais monthly ""social transfer"" programs to low-paid workers, subsidies far-right President Jair Bolsonaro agreed to under pressure from Brazil's congress.
While it would still represent the steepest annual downturn on record, it is the most optimistic outlook since May. The central bank chart below shows the 2020 GDP growth forecasts in blue, and the 2021 forecast at a robust 3.5% for a seventh week.
Graphic - Brazil GDP forecasts: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdpzdawepw/FOCUSGDP.png
Much of the recent optimism can be traced to a decision to extend the emergency payments by an extra two months, says Julia Braga, associate professor of economics at the Universidade Federal Fluminense in Rio de Janeiro state. 
The monthly payments from April to August will total around 254 billion reais ($48 billion), according to Economy Ministry estimates. That's around 3.5% of GDP put directly into people's pockets in a matter of months.
Almost half of the entire population, across nearly 30 million families, received the aid in June, statistics agency IBGE reckons. 
""If the emergency aid ends and there is no similar type of income transfer program in its place to meet the needs of informal workers and poor families, there will be no growth, there will be no rebound,"" Braga said.
""Even if a COVID vaccine is found, economic fragility is huge. The labor market won't recover quickly ... and if the government returns to austerity, there will be no broader recovery,"" she said.
Local media reports say the Economy Ministry is looking into extending these payments through the end of the year, but at a lower 200 reais a month. Even the reduced level would be a major U-turn for officials who insist the spending well has run dry and may reflect the unexpected popularity boost Bolsonaro has enjoyed from the program in some of Brazil's poorest regions.
The economic case for public investment, known as ""fiscal multipliers,"" is a strong one, especially when the economy is depressed. 
During normal times, 1% growth in public investment leads to 1.3% growth in GDP, according to Rodrigo Orair at the IPEA institute for applied economics in Brasilia. During recessions, the impact is even stronger, with a 2.2% rise in GDP growth.
But Economy Minister Paulo Guedes and his team take a completely different view, arguing that tight control over public spending is paramount, especially given the record deficit and debt caused by the crisis.
LABOR PAINS
While some indicators such as the latest formal job figures have been surprisingly upbeat, the labor market remains fragile. 
Carlos Kawall, director at ASA Bank in Sao Paulo and a former treasury secretary, is skeptical that halting the payments will be quite so damaging to the economy, as they are focused on low-income brackets which consume less, especially services.
But he agrees that the labor market is the economy's Achilles' heel, particularly in the services sector - comprising everything from bartenders to educators - which accounts for around 70% of all economic activity and where most jobs have been lost.
""The labor market is the most comprehensive guide we have for the health of the economy, and the level of nationwide employment is still very depressed,"" Kawall said.
""Services are lagging the recovery and they respond for the bulk of unemployment. The recovery might be very slow,"" he added.
The government in April launched a $10 billion program allowing companies to reduce workers' salaries and hours, or temporarily suspend contracts, in order to preserve as many jobs as possible.
The Economy Ministry estimates that more than 8 million jobs have been preserved. But these measures are expected to expire by the end of the year.
Brazil lost nearly 1.5 million formal jobs in the March-June period, well over a million of them in retail and other services. The Economy Ministry chart below shows 1.2 million formal jobs lost in the January-June period, over 80% of which were in retail and other services.
Graphic - Brazil formal job losses: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwvkeyazvm/CAGEDSERVICOS.png
Data to mid-July show that barely 81 million of Brazil's 170 million working-age population is at work, Kawall notes, a figure that has fallen by an alarming 3 million in recent weeks. The underemployment rate is a record high 27.5% and set to rise further. 

As the economy's reopening brings more people back into the workforce, the official unemployment rate of 12.9% is likely to rise also.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda warned that economic activity could be constrained ""significantly"" again if strict public health measures are reinstated to prevent a further spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
But he said that Japan was not slipping into deflation and that the central bank would continue with its efforts to achieve its elusive 2% inflation target.
""We're not in deflation, in the sense of sustained periods of price declines. It certainly took more time than we hoped for, but I'm sure we will achieve the target,"" Kuroda told an online seminar hosted by Columbia University on Wednesday.
Kuroda reiterated the BOJ's readiness to ramp up monetary stimulus ""without hesitation"" if needed to combat the hit to the economy from the pandemic.
""Despite extremely high uncertainties, the Japanese and overseas economies are likely to improve gradually from the second half of this year,"" Kuroda said.
""But the pace of improvement is expected to be only moderate, since preventive measures (to contain the virus) will constrain economic activity,"" he said.
Kuroda rejected criticism by some analysts that the BOJ was threatening its independence from government interference by monetising public debt through aggressive bond purchases.
""Given the impact of COVID-19 (on the economy), the BOJ has purchased government bonds to maintain stability in the bond market and keep the entire yield curve at low levels,"" he said.
""This is monetary policy ... I don't think this kind of policy mix, or coordination (with the government) would make the central bank less independent,"" he added.
Kuroda also said Japan's financial system was ""quite safe and stable,"" countering concerns that the fallout from COVID-19 could trigger a banking-sector crisis.

""But if the COVID 19-driven downturn prolongs longer than expected, we have to be vigilant to the risks to financial system stability,"" he said.

1394,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 08:54AM ET</span>",U.S. Treasury Plans a Record $112 Billion Quarterly Debt Sale,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Treasury expanded its plans for the issuance of longer-term debt in coming months, after depending mainly on shorter-dated bills to fund the federal government’s record spending surge to address the Covid-19 crisis.
The department on Wednesday said it will issue a record $112 billion of securities at next week’s so-called quarterly refunding of maturing Treasuries. Over the three months through October, it will ramp up “nominal coupon issuance” by a total of $132 billion compared with the previous quarter.
Coupons refer to notes that include interest payments -- unlike bills, which don’t. The Treasury more than doubled the supply of T-bills outstanding earlier this year as it rushed to finance a record stimulus program approved by Congress. It’s also gathered an unprecedented hoard of cash, partly in preparation for loan forgiveness to small businesses under that earlier virus-relief program.
Now, the Treasury is increasing longer-dated issuance to help take back some of the shortening in the average maturity of outstanding federal debt. That’s at a time when long-term borrowing costs have been hitting record lows. The Treasury’s Borrowing Advisory Committee in May had noted that 30% of Treasury debt would mature within a year.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. strategists calculated recently that the average maturity of Treasury debt had declined to its shortest since 2011.
Among the changes announced Wednesday:
“Treasury will continue to shift financing from bills to longer-dated tenors over the coming quarters, using long-term issuance as a prudent means of managing its maturity profile and limiting potential future issuance volatility,” the department said in a statement Wednesday.
With another stimulus package looming, uncertainties remain over the exact funding needs in coming months. On Monday, the Treasury said it expected to raise $947 billion in debt over the three months through September, and another $1.216 trillion in net marketable debt in the final three months of 2020.

Those projections were based on a placeholder calculation of $1 trillion of additional funding needs stemming from the virus-relief bill under negotiation in Washington. Republicans have proposed that amount in their plan, while Democrats are pressing a more comprehensive $3.5 trillion package, which cleared the House in May.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Silvia Puntano, a mother of seven from the poor Buenos Aires suburb of Villa Azul, these days has only one thing on her mind: where to find her next meal.
""Every day, I go from one community kitchen to another, I go there to look for food,"" the 37-year-old said. ""Other days I have to dig around and go outside (to ask) because even though I receive financial support, but it is not enough.""
Her life is a painful portrait of poverty in a country on the cusp of a $65 billion debt deal after economic crises triggered the country's ninth sovereign default in May.
Poverty in Argentina is set to rise sharply this year due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but the rate was already climbing amid a recession since 2018 and high inflation.
On Tuesday the government said it had a deal to restructure its foreign debt, which it says is vital to reviving growth and alleviating poverty. Experts say half the country's population could be plunged into poverty this year.
""The situation is increasingly difficult because there are many people who come looking for a plate of food,"" said Paola Carabajal, a cook from the capital's Bernal district, who lost her job and now helps serve meals at a community kitchen.
""Most of the people who come are informal workers who were left without a fixed income for their families.""
Argentina's minister for social development, Daniel Arroyo, told Reuters that the number of people seeking food aid at kitchens daily has risen to more than 11 million from 8 million before the pandemic hit.
""That is the emergency,"" the minister said. Monthly spending on food aid has risen from 5 billion pesos to 14 billion Argentine pesos ($193 million), he said.
The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean expects Argentina to be one of the worst affected countries in the region this year in terms of poverty and job losses.
Eusebio Hernández Greco, a pastor from the Cacupé church, said the parish kitchen now serves at least 180 meals a day, from 80 before the pandemic.
The capital and its surrounds are still under coronavirus lockdown measures first imposed in March.
Economist Juan Manuel Palacios said the debt deal wouldn't solve the issue of poverty, but might help avoid the worst-case scenario.

""Does the debt agreement imply that economic problems are solved? No, not at all,"" he said. ""However, with an indefinite default we were sure to explode.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The bloom is back at Lee's Flower and Card Shop in Washington's historic U Street neighborhood, with an added touch: Blue, green, yellow and white origami cranes spelling out the words ""Black Lives Matter"" on the storefront window.
The signs reflect a slow return to normalcy as life and business adapt to the coronavirus pandemic and racial justice movement that both erupted in the first half of 2020.
The business, run by sisters Stacie Lee Banks and Kristie Lee, stayed open during the months of mandated shutdown in Washington, doing deliveries as its doors stayed shut.
Clients have been welcomed back into the store since June 22, although a table bars anyone from stepping in more than 10 feet. For wedding and funeral consultations customers may go further inside, but only after checking their temperatures.
""I think that we could have reopened more than we did, but we're still being cautious about our space and not letting people in, because our employees are concerned,"" Banks said.
When D.C. businesses reopened, the city government gave small businesses a supply of masks and hand sanitizer upon request. The shop, one of several U.S. small businesses that Reuters is following through the crisis, also bought face shields for employees and a thermometer. 
The sisters had to modify staff schedules, with people working the same number of hours over fewer days.
The third generation owners of the family business also alternate their days in the shop to care for their mother, who was diagnosed with dementia this summer. 
Staying open during the pandemic means rolling with unexpected punches, like when an employee attended a gathering where someone later tested positive for the coronavirus. The employee needed to quarantine, forcing the shop to juggle shifts.
""We're a small staff, but we're mighty, and so when one person is gone, we have to try to figure out how to replace them,"" Banks said.
BUSINESS BEGINS TO BLOOM
Business has rebounded from a slump in the early days of the pandemic lockdown. Between June 1 and July 28, sales jumped 71% from a year earlier.
Being a Black-owned business may be a factor, Banks said. The killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in May sparked national protests over racial injustice and a ""buy Black"" movement that she said has led customers to her shop.
Many people are sending flowers to their loved ones instead of visiting them. And orders have risen for funerals and a pandemic trend, micro-weddings.
""Where we ordinarily would have 20 deliveries a day, we're having 40 and 50 deliveries a day,"" Banks said. Three more people have been hired, bringing her staff total to 12.
Banks served on Washington's reopening advisory committee, and is happy with how the district had reopened.
""I really think they did a good job by not reopening too soon, because look at all the places that are having to close back down, like California, Texas,"" Banks said.
As the White House and Congress debate the next coronavirus relief bill, Banks said she would like more business funding and clarity on Paycheck Protection Program loans. 
The shop received a $75,000 loan under the program, allowing it to rehire furloughed staff.

""They say it's forgivable, but they haven't come out with any clear-cut rules on how to make it forgivable,"" Banks said. ""I am on pins and needles.""

1399,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 06:22AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday, August 5th","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com -- U.S. and Chinese governments are set to discuss their trade agreement in August, and so much more. Meanwhile, Wall Street is set for more gains amid progress on the next coronavirus relief bill, led higher by strong gains from Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) with its streaming service in demand. Elsewhere, eyes will be on gold as it burst through the $2,000/oz level and on the latest private jobs data ahead of Friday’s payrolls release. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, August 5th.
1. U.S., China to discuss trade agreement, among other things
The U.S. and China have agreed to get together in the middle of August to  review the phase one trade agreement they signed early this year, the Wall Street Journal reported late Tuesday.
The two countries are sure to use this opportunity to discuss the mounting number of mutual grievances that have poisoned what appeared at the time of the signing to be a reasonably warm relationship.
Under the Phase 1 trade deal signed in January, China had pledged to boost purchases of U.S. goods by some $200 billion over 2017 levels, including agricultural and manufactured products, energy and services.
However, that was before the global coronavirus plunged much of the globe into recession, and China, which was hit first, is not even close to keeping that pledge.
Tensions between the two countries have risen sharply for a number of reasons, including China's handling of the coronavirus, U.S. sanctions related to China's security crackdown on Hong Kong, U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to ban U.S. use of the Chinese-owned video app TikTok unless it is sold to a non-Chinese buyer, and now plans for U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar to visit Taiwan in coming days, in what would be the highest-level visit by a U.S. official in four decades.
2. Progress on new relief package helps stocks higher
U.S. stock markets are seen opening higher Wednesday, amid hopes that Congress is making progress on a new virus aid package.
By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), the Dow Jones futures contract was up 184 points or 0.7%, while theS&P 500 futures contract was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was 0.3% higher.
After more than a week of heated discussions, negotiations on a new round of coronavirus relief have begun to move in the right direction, though the two sides remain far apart, the U.S. Senate's top Democrat said on Tuesday.
""We remain far apart on a number of issues. But we're finally moving in the right direction,"" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. ""At the moment, the gap between our two parties in the negotiations is about priorities and about scale.""
Hopes are rising that a deal could be reached by the end of the week and approved as early as the following week, potentially good news for tens of millions of unemployed Americans whose boosted unemployment benefits have expired. 
The earnings season continues Wednesday, with the likes of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) and CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) due to report.
Another company to keep an eye on is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which closed at another record high on Tuesday. The iPhone maker now has a market capitalization of $1.87 trillion, meaning it now makes up 6.5% of the S&P 500, breaking the record of 6.4% held by  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) in 1985.
3. ADP leads off big jobs week
U.S. jobs are front and center this week, with investors looking to the labour market to shed light on the strength of the economic rebound.
First up, at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), the non-farm ADP jobs report is expected to show a gain of 1.5 million workers, a slowing in growth from 2.369 million in June, as the surge in Covid-19 cases halted the reopening of businesses in a number of states. 
Thursday sees the release of the weekly report on initial jobless claims. Last week’s figures showed a second straight weekly increase in initial jobless claims, together with the biggest increase in continuing claims since May.
“Both initial and continuing unemployment claims have picked up in recent weeks, which could show up as a decline in employment during August if the trend persists,” said Diane Swonk, Chief Economist at Grant Thornton.
Friday’s official nonfarm payrolls report for July is the big number, following June’s strapping 4.8 million figure. 
“We are left with a wide band of uncertainty, with payroll employment expected to slow but not contract in July,” added Swonk, calling for total payrolls to rise by 750,000 in July, “less than a fifth of the gain we saw in June.” 
4. Gold sprints past $2,000/oz
Gold had very little difficulty breaking through the $2,000 per ounce level for the first time ever, with the yellow metal sprinting past that historic barrier late Tuesday.
“Investors continue to pile into gold ETFs, with holdings having increased by more than 820koz over the last week, leaving them at a record 108.51moz,” analysts at ING said, in a research note.
The two main factors put forward for the surge in the price of gold have been weakness in the U.S. dollar, which gold is denominated in, and the very low interest rate environment, which means there is very little opportunity cost for holding commodities, like gold, which don’t provide an income.
“A weak dollar has been one of the factors for buying gold, but the dollar index has taken a bit of a corrective pause in recent days, so I don't think we can put the latest surge down to that,” explained Robert Carnell, Regional Head of Research Asia Pacific at ING, in a research note.
“Negative real rates are a more compelling longer-term reason for holding gold. Policy interest rates and longer-term bond yields look to be locked down for the rest of this year and next, and maybe longer.” 
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), gold futures were up 1.5% at $2,038.90/oz.
5. Disney soars with “Mulan” set for streaming platform 
Walt Disney stock is soaring premarket despite taking a nearly $5 billion charge, as the entertainment giant managed to register an adjusted profit late Tuesday, despite the coronavirus pandemic forcing the closure of its parks as well as movie theaters and many sporting events.
The highlight came from its Disney+ streaming service, which had 60.5 million paying customers as of Monday, after just nine months of operation.
Combined with Hulu and ESPN+, Disney has attracted more than 100 million streaming customers worldwide since launching its streaming effort nine months ago.
Disney also announced that its expected blockbuster “Mulan” will go straight to this streaming platform in September, skipping most movie theaters.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's new top financial regulator Ryozo Himino voiced caution over taking fresh steps to promote cryptocurrency trading, arguing that doing so may not necessarily promote technical innovation.
Tokyo should instead focus on efforts toward issuing central bank digital currencies (CBDC), as the coronavirus pandemic could speed up the arrival of a cash-less society, he said.
""Deregulating bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies may not necessarily promote technical innovation, if doing so simply increases speculative trading,"" said Himino, who spear-headed last year's G20 debate on regulating cryptocurrencies.
""We're not thinking of taking special steps to promote cryptocurrencies,"" he told Reuters on Wednesday.
Himino became the Financial Services Agency's new commissioner in July, replacing Toshihide Endo.
Under Japan's chair, Group of 20 major economies last year agreed to set strict regulations on cryptocurrencies such as Facebook's (O:FB) Libra, warning that various global risks they could pose must first be addressed.
Himino welcomed the Bank of Japan's recent efforts to speed up research on CBDCs, saying Tokyo must look more closely at ways to address potential challenges if they were to be issued in the future.
""We shouldn't be worrying about various challenges without even trying to design a plan (for issuing CBDCs),"" he said.
""In the end, Japan must think really hard about whether to issue CBDCs because there are merits and demerits to doing so. What it can do now is to be ready so that when Japan decides to issue CBDCs, it can do so straight away,"" he said.
Himino also said there was no ""one-size-fits-all"" solution for Japan's struggling regional lenders, which are suffering from a shrinking local population, ultra-low interest rates and the hit from COVID-19.
Regional banks can use government bail-out programmes if they think that would best serve borrowers, though conditions have not deteriorated to such a degree so far, he said.
""At present, there isn't any regional bank that is facing concerns over its financial health,"" Himino said.
""If some of them do face financial challenges, there are various steps they can take such as cutting costs, coming up with ways to boost profits or raising capital from markets,"" he said.
The coronavirus pandemic has added to the pain for Japan's roughly 100 regional banks already reeling from a sluggish economy and years of ultra-low rates that have eroded their profit margins.

China's economy could grow more than 4% in the third quarter and over 6% in the fourth quarter, bringing the 2020 growth to around 2%, Ma was quoted by Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) Finance as saying. 
""At present, the strength of counter-cyclical adjustment of monetary policy is not small. We should maintain the current strength, and there is no need to step up,"" Ma said.
""If we boost stimulus, there could be some negative consequences, such as real estate and stock market bubbles.""
The central bank should reserve some ammunition to cope with impacts from rising tensions with the United States and possible financial risks, Ma said.
A stronger-than-expected rebound in activity in the second quarter has reduced the urgency for the PBOC to ease policy further, but will keep conditions accommodative to support the recovery, sources have told Reuters. 

The PBOC has rolled out a raft of steps since February, including cuts in lending rates, banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR) and targeted support for virus-hit companies such as cheap loans.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at a record low for a second straight meeting on Wednesday, as the economy is showing signs of improvement with the easing of restrictions to halt the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy is recovering from its worst-ever crisis but social restrictions and bans on foreign travellers entering the country are expected to weigh on household spending and tourism this year.
The Bank of Thailand's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted unanimously to keep the one-day repurchase rate  steady at a record low of 0.50%, as expected in a Reuters poll.
""The policy rate is no longer the main actor as it is already very low compared with in the past and regional ones,"" Titanun Mallikamas, secretary of the MPC, told a news conference.
The BOT has cut its policy rate five times since August, including three this year, totalling 125 basis points to support the economy. With limited ammunition left, some analysts expect it will stay on hold for the rest of the year.
But the BOT was ready to ""use tools in its bag in case of emergency,"" Titanun said.
""Overall economic activities would take at least two years before returning to the pre-pandemic level,"" he added.
Concerned that a strong baht  would affect the economic recovery, the BOT said it was monitoring the situation and was ready to take the necessary steps.
The central bank said it sees inflation back to target next year.
With inflation sluggish and the economy reeling from a collapse in tourism and slump in exports, analysts do not expect a quick economic turnaround.
""While the relaxation of social distancing measures have help to shore up some demand, it is likely that recovery will take quite some time,"" said Kobsidthi Silpachai, head of capital markets research of Kasikornbank.

The BOT has forecast the economy will shrink by a record 8.1% this year, while the government has introduced billions of dollars of fiscal and monetary measures to support the economy.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - It took months of tough talks for Argentina to reach agreement on restructuring $65 billion in debt. Now, economists and policymakers say, the real work begins: reviving Latin America's No. 3 economy from its currency and fiscal crises.
Though both government and creditors celebrated Tuesday's deal that should help Argentina avert a messy default, it still faces a 10%-plus contraction this year, an over-valued peso, spiking poverty and a deep fiscal hole.
""This was the easy step,"" Stephen Liston, senior director at the Council of the Americas, said of the debt deal.
How the once-wealthy grains producer does from now is the acid test for Peronist President Alberto Fernandez and his star Economy Minister Martin Guzman, fresh from taming Wall Street.
""This is an important step,"" Guzman said of the agreement. ""But this does not solve all the problems of the Argentine economy.""
Argentina's peso has been propped up by tight capital controls, which has seen the value of the currency in black market trades veer dangerously away from the official rate, with the gap currently around 76%.
The government says it plans to ease controls, but only when the economy has been righted, leaving an artificially strong peso that businesses say hinders trade.
'PRECARIOUS SITUATION'
""It's a very precarious situation there where you've got an over-valued currency, but weakening it will only worsen the debt situation,"" said Nikhil Sanghani of Capital Economics in London.
Inflation, the thorn in the side of Argentine policymakers for years, shows little sign of abating. Consumer prices have slowed during the pandemic, but remain at an annualized level above 40% and will likely revive as the economy recovers.
The central bank, looking to mop up liquidity, is facing a ""snowball"" of short-term debt, temporarily reining in prices but increasingly straining the institution, said economist Eduardo Levy Yeyati of Buenos Aires' Universidad Torcuato Di Tella.
Getting out from under this would likely mean the bank has to raise interest rates to encourage savings in pesos, he added, otherwise it would risk unleashing a new wave of inflation.
Under the weight of public spending to combat the impact of the pandemic, the primary fiscal deficit soared to $3.53 billion in June and the government is expected to end the year with a large fiscal hole. 
Guzman has pledged to return to fiscal balance and keep the deficit under control, but faces a politically tricky balancing act between that and growth-boosting policies.
""The fiscal deficit has blown out again and we think that the primary deficit will be something like 8% of GDP this year,"" said Sanghani, adding it could force the government to adopt politically unpalatable measures even as millions face increased poverty.
""If they have to impose some sort of austerity going forward, it will only keep the economy quite weak and that will hinder its ability to pay off even these restructured debts.""
IMF TALKS 
The government plans to turn attention to negotiating a new program with its biggest creditor, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which floated a $57 billion line in 2018. 
Argentina may seek to extend its payment schedule in return for lowering inflation, fixing the exchange rate and reeling in public spending, said Claudio Loser, a former director at the IMF's Western Hemisphere department. 
""That would help Argentina a lot in the next decade, if it can be done,"" Loser said. 
But despite a softer approach from the IMF, any deal would likely come with some tough fiscal demands.

""It's feasible that the Fernandez government is hesitant on some of these terms,"" Sanghani said. ""There are still some hurdles to getting a renewed IMF deal, so it's not a forgone conclusion by any stretch of the imagination.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - A group of investors is raising concerns about the treatment of migrant workers in the Gulf, warning that labour practices risk leading to abuses such as modern slavery. 
The group, led by fund manager CCLA, says it represents 38 investors with over $3 trillion in managed assets and wants companies to disclose how they protect migrant workers.
Such workers, many of them from Asia, provide the backbone of Gulf economies, working in sectors such as construction, hospitality and oil and gas. 
The group of investors has written to over 50 international companies operating in the region. It does not imply any wrongdoing by the companies it has written to but said some may be unaware of the risks.
The group is concerned recruitment practices can require low-paid migrant workers to pay large fees to agents and middlemen to obtain employment in the Gulf, it said in a statement.
Those workers often need to take out loans or sign over assets to pay those fees, which may lead them to being in ""debt bondage"" and at high risk of forced labour and modern slavery, it said.
""As investors, we have a moral duty to ensure that we are not profiting from modern slavery in any shape or form,"" CCLA’s Chief Executive Peter Hugh Smith said.
The group also raised concerns about employers withholding migrant workers' passports and the impact the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic has had on migrant workers.
Shell (L:RDSa), Spanish construction firm Acciona (MC:ANA), French construction firm  Vinci  (PA:SGEF), Hyatt (N:H) and Wyndham Hotels (N:WH) told Reuters they were committed to protecting human rights and had policies designed to safeguard workers.
Shell, Acciona and Vinci said those policies did not allow charging recruitment fees to workers and that they review worker welfare. Wyndham said it was not aware of any malpractice in any of its hotels.
Vinci said it was challenging to guarantee a fair recruitment process in many regions and that the company had to be vigilant to safeguard workers.

Amnesty International Campaigner Ella Knight said the Gulf's migrant workers had long faced problems including not being paid, late payment of wages, forced labour, dangerous working conditions and overcrowded, unsanitary accommodation.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is considering extending a special employment subsidy to help firms hit by the coronavirus pandemic that would keep furloughed workers on the payroll, but no decision has been made yet, a labour ministry official told Reuters on Wednesday.
The comments come after the Nikkei business daily reported the ministry was working to extend the subsidy, citing an unnamed ruling party official.
The news underscores concerns among policymakers that the expiration of the subsidy could trigger a spike in job losses as many firms struggle to make ends meet amid difficult financing conditions.
""It has not been decided yet, but we are considering it,"" the labour ministry official told Reuters on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.
""Lawmakers have floated an extension to the year-end during a meeting with us yesterday.""
The special measure was designed to increase a subsidy, given to companies who keep furloughed employees on their payroll, for the six months through to the end of September.
The daily payment was raised to up to 15,000 yen ($141.80) per employee from up to 8,330 yen previously.
Some 2.36 million people were furloughed as of June, up 0.9 million from a year earlier, government data showed, prompting lawmakers to urge an extension of the special measure.
The government has set aside about 1.6 trillion yen for the special subsidy, and as of the end of July, had already provided 585.1 billion yen of that to companies.
The government will make the necessary arrangements to deal with an increase in the fiscal burden stemming from an extension, the business daily said.
Japan's job market has been cooling as the spread of the coronavirus forced businesses to close and people to stay home.
Although the restrictions were lifted late in May, policymakers have had to balance containing the virus with the need to resume economic activity as the world's third-largest economy faces its deepest recession in decades.

1407,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 11:40PM ET</span>",Japan short of rescue plans for regional lenders hit by pandemic,"By Leika Kihara and Takahiko Wada
KYOTO(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic is deepening the pain for Japan's regional lenders, heightening concerns that a potential wave of business closures will test policymakers' ability to avert a damaging banking-sector crisis.
Many central government and bank officials see the risk of a crisis emerging in the next few months, when more struggling firms could go under and hit regional banks already weakened by a shrinking domestic economy and years of ultra-low interest rates.
Yet officials still have few plans besides prodding the ailing lenders to recapitalise or consolidate - and little clue on how to do this in an orderly fashion, say five government and banking sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
""Banks are aggressively lending now because the government is asking them to, but that could change once it becomes clearer some companies cannot survive,"" one of the people said.
""The key test will come in autumn, when liquidity problems turn into solvency problems.""
With Tokyo still encouraging regional banks to pump money to needy borrowers, efforts to mitigate a subsequent build-up of bad loans will take a back seat, another source said.
""In the end, there's no other option besides prodding the weaker banks to consolidate, restructure themselves or seek government capital,"" the second person said. 
The sources - policymakers with direct knowledge of the banking industry and the discussions on dealing with its troubles - declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
TIME RUNNING SHORT
A wall of money printed by the central bank has kept a lid on bankruptcies and job losses, even as Japan's recession deepens.
But the prolonged battle with COVID-19 is straining even the strongest regional banks in places like Osaka and Kyoto.
Regional economies are more vulnerable to shocks than big cities because of their over-reliance on sectors such as tourism, and fewer jobs as more firms move out of ageing, dwindling local markets.
After Japan closed its borders to contain the pandemic, Osaka-based hotel chain White Bear Family went under with 27.8 billion yen ($262 million) in liabilities - the biggest virus-related bankruptcy so far in Japan.
That left regional lender  Kansai Mirai Financial  Group (T:7321) with 800 million yen in unrecoverable loans. The group expects credit costs to nearly triple to 12.5 billion yen this year. 
Osaka saw 147 companies go under in June, exceeding Tokyo as the hardest hit centre in Japan, according to think tank Tokyo Shoko Research.
""The damage from the pandemic (on the region's economy) will probably last for about two years,"" Kansai Mirai President Tetsuya Kan told Reuters.
Already under the wings of nationwide lender Resona Group, Kansai Mirai can survive by cutting costs, consolidating branches and earning more advisory fees, Kan said. 
Bank of Kyoto faces a similar plight. It set aside 5 billion yen to guard against bad loans in the year to March, 10 times the average in the past five years, as soft global demand and plunging overseas visitor numbers hit borrowers.
Regional banks were already reeling from lending margins that have sunk to a meagre 0.2%.
While their average capital-to-asset ratio, at 9.52%, is more than double the minimum required 4%, over 70% of regional banks suffered falling profits or chalked up losses in the year ending March. 
Even before COVID-19 erupted, their combined bad loans were worth 3.7 trillion yen, nearly four times combined profits from core operations.
""At present, Japan's financial system is stable"" with regional banks having sufficiant capital buffers, the country's banking regulator Financial Services Agency (FSA) said.
""But we will closely monitor the situation as (COVID-19) could potentially affect various factors such as their credit costs and securities holdings,"" the agency told Reuters in response to a request for comment.

https://tmsnrt.rs/3hUtpIh
WORST TO COME 
Analysts warn the worst is yet to come.
Responding to requests by regulators to boost lending to virus-hit firms, regional banks increased loans by 4.7% in June from a year earlier to a record 262 trillion yen.
While a bulk of the emergency lending is guaranteed by the government, other loans could sour if the prolonged pandemic hits firms on life support, analysts say.
The fear among policymakers is a negative loop where rising bankruptcies weaken regional banks' ability to lend, forcing more firms under.
The government is preparing safety nets. It extended by four years a deadline for lenders to apply for a bail-out and expanded to 15 trillion yen from 12 trillion yen a pool of funds to inject capital into ailing banks.
But there is no guarantee lenders will willingly seek help.
Years of efforts by policymakers to consolidate Japan's crowded regional banking industry failed as many executives are wary of stepping down or opening room for government intervention.
Bank of Kyoto president Nobuhiro Doi told Reuters the prospect of merging was ""not something we're thinking about"", saying such a move ""won't have much of a positive effect on profits.""
Doi also ruled out the possibility of seeking government help. ""The government says it will make it easier for banks to seek help by not asking executives to take responsibility. But I wonder whether it will really work out that way,"" he said.
There is also no consensus on how deeply the Bank of Japan should be involved in bank rescue plans, which could complicate Tokyo's efforts to avoid a full-blown financial crisis.
BOJ officials argue the onus is on the government to bail out companies and banks, pushing back against requests from some lawmakers for the central bank to play a bigger role.
Time is running short for banks to come up with ways to boost profits and cushion the blow from rising bad loans, as more companies reel from COVID-19.

""There's no one-size-fits all approach because so much depends on how long the pandemic persists and how the fallout affects each regional economy,"" said a third source. ""It's probably a slow death for many regional lenders.""

1408,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 09:30PM ET</span>",The trade secret minefield: What workers risk when changing jobs,"By Paresh Dave
OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Self-driving truck entrepreneur Anthony Levandowski on Tuesday received an 18-month prison sentence in the highest-profile trade secrets theft case in Silicon Valley in recent years.
Here is a look at where the law stands on taking documents when leaving a job.
What was Levandowski convicted of?
Prosecutors said Levandowski deliberately moved over 14,000 sensitive files to his personal computer while working at Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with a goal of eventually benefiting his future employer, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. Levandowski was indicted for stealing 33 documents deemed trade secrets, but pleaded guilty to taking just one document. He agreed that the document, a weekly project-tracking spreadsheet, was a trade secret.
What is a trade secret?
Companies have sought to protect increasing amounts of private information such as formulas and processes from leaving their walls by deeming them trade secrets. Disputes over whether something is a trade secret often hinge on whether others in the field know about it and whether it is independently valuable. 
""The line is often drawn by the company you're leaving, and they often declare things to be trade secrets that aren't trade secrets,"" said Ed Swanson, a San Francisco criminal defense attorney. 
Is it safe to take anything before leaving a company?
Attorneys on both sides of these battles said the safest route is to ask permission to take any desired files. 
""Some companies are very generous with that if you bring it up ahead of time,"" said Jim Pooley, an employment law attorney in Silicon Valley. 
In addition, workers likely without concern can leave with items that have been published, are generic in nature or that they have possessed since before joining the company. Engineers, for instance, could keep public records related to issued patents, while salespeople could exit with a contacts list they had from before joining a company.
Employment law attorney Nicole Galli said a rule of thumb may be asking, Would this be something the company is ""going to be willing to file a lawsuit over?""
What are the risks of taking something without okay?
Most disputes are settled out of court, with workers agreeing to return files and sometimes inspections of their devices to verify no copies remain. Workers also may have to stay away from certain projects or industries as part of settlements. 
In the rare cases where the items in dispute are so valuable that companies involve law enforcement, workers could face years-long prison sentences. 
The new employer sometimes pays for a worker's defense if it deems the allegations unfounded. Other companies, including Uber eventually with Levandowski, have fired workers for removing materials from their previous workplace.
Levandowski told the court that his actions were ""not worth the loss of respect"" from family, friends and colleagues and the public humiliation he has suffered.
What about accidents?
People who accidentally leave with some files in their phone or backpack rarely face criminal prosecution. But workers who leave for a competitor face greater risks, regardless of their position, experience or intent, attorneys said.
""Make sure you've sent nothing to a personal email,"" said Swanson, who this year beat a trade secrets prosecution against a former Jawbone employee who left for rival hardware maker Fitbit (NYSE:FIT).

""Pay attention to where you back up your devices,"" he added. ""Make sure you’ve looked at every thumb drive you have that could have something from the company.""

1409,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 09:20PM ET</span>","China, U.S. to review trade deal, air other grievances on August 15: sources","By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior U.S. and Chinese officials will review the implementation of their Phase 1 trade deal and likely air mutual grievances in an increasingly tense relationship during an Aug. 15 videoconference, two people familiar with the plans said.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, the principal negotiators for the two countries, will participate in the meeting, an initial six-month review of the pact activated on Feb. 15.
The meeting plans were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The U.S. Trade Representative's office and the U.S. Treasury did not respond to requests for comment. 
Under the Phase 1 trade deal signed in January, China had pledged to boost purchases of U.S. goods by some $200 billion over 2017 levels, including agricultural and manufactured products, energy and services.
But China, battered by the global coronavirus recession, is far behind the pace needed to meet its first-year goal of a $77 billion increase. Imports of farm goods have been lower than the 2017 level, far behind the 50% increase needed to meet the 2020 target of $36.5 billion. 
Beijing has bought only 5% of the energy products needed to meet the Phase 1 first year goal of $25.3 billion
One of the people familiar with the plans said Chinese officials hoped to discuss other issues beyond the Phase 1 trade deal implementation.
""It's both the normal semi-annual review and also comes at a time when the relationship continues to deteriorate. Naturally there is much to discuss,"" the person said.
China's ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said on Tuesday that there was always a plan for high-level consultations six months into the pact, but the two sides have remained in regular contact over the trade deal.
""If they do have such a meeting I guess it will be very positive,"" Cui told a virtual event sponsored by the Aspen Security Forum. 
Trump has threatened to end the trade pact over China's handling of the coronavirus, which originated in the city of Wuhan, and tensions have risen over U.S. sanctions related to China's security crackdown on Hong Kong.
The latest irritant between the world's two largest economies is Trump's threat to ban U.S. use of the Chinese-owned video app TikTok unless it is sold to a non-Chinese buyer.

White House officials on Tuesday could not say how Trump's suggestion that the U.S. Treasury get a significant portion of the proceeds of the sale - potentially to U.S. software giant Microsoft (O:MSFT) - could be implemented.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday sentenced former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski to 18 months in prison for stealing a trade secret from Google related to self-driving cars months before becoming the head of  Uber Technologies Inc 's (N:UBER) rival unit.
U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco said Levandowski, who was convicted on Tuesday following a March plea agreement, said Levandowski could enter custody once the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.
Alsup said a sentence short of imprisonment would have given ""a green light to every future brilliant engineer to steal trade secrets,"" comparing what Levandowski took to a ""competitor's game plan.""
The 75-year-old judge, who has been involved in Silicon Valley litigation for nearly five decades, described Levandowski's conviction as the ""biggest trade secret crime I have ever seen.""
""Billions [of dollars] in the future were at play, and when those kind of financial incentives are there good people will do terrible things, and that's what happened here,"" Alsup said.
Prosecutors sought a 27-month prison sentence.
Levandowski requested one-year confinement at his Marin County home, contending that bouts with pneumonia in recent years would make him susceptible to death from the novel coronavirus while in prison. His attorneys asked the judge to consider that investigators found no evidence that ""Levandowski used any of Google's trade secrets after leaving Google's employment.""
Levandowski transferred more than 14,000 Google files including development schedules and product designs to his personal laptop before leaving the company and while negotiating a deal with Uber, where he briefly led its self-driving car unit. 
Uber fired Levandowski in 2017 and then settled a lawsuit from Alphabet over the misuse of trade secrets, setting back the ride-hailing company's self-driving project. 
The dispute between the companies is ongoing. Levandowski filed for bankruptcy in March because he owes $179 million to Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google for his actions before resigning in January 2016. 
Google last week asked the bankruptcy judge to reject Uber's argument that it is not responsible for paying the $179 million under his old employment agreement. 
Levandowski, who now runs self-driving truck company Pronto, apologized to Google and said he plans to share his story of regret with others in the tech industry.

""Today marks the end of three and a half long years and the beginning of another long road ahead,"" he said in a statement.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China is looking to reduce its reliance on overseas markets and technology for its economic development, government advisers say, as U.S. hostility and a global pandemic increase external risks that could hamper longer-term progress.
The country's leaders have proposed a so-called ""dual circulation"" model of growth to steer the economy, the sources said, which would prioritise ""internal circulation"" to boost domestic demand and be supplemented by ""external circulation"". No details have been given on the strategy.
Policy insiders and government advisers said the emphasis signals a strategic shift to local demand and technological development although domestic supply chains would be built partly with the help of foreign investment.
""The Chinese leadership raised the 'internal circulation' concept as the situation has become grim, although complete (reliance on) 'internal circulation' is unlikely,"" said a policy insider, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
China had already been trying to rebalance its economy towards consumption-led growth from exports and investment. Last year, total exports and imports accounted for 32% of gross domestic product (GDP), down from a peak of 64% in 2006, according to government data. 
""We will rely more on domestic demand as foreign trade will decline, and the United States is imposing a tech blockade,"" said a second policy insider.
The ""dual circulation"" strategy could become a key priority in the government's 14th five-year plan (2021-2025), which is expected to be discussed and endorsed by top leaders at a key Communist Party conclave in October, policy sources said.
The plan is likely to be unveiled during the annual parliament session in early 2021, they said. 
The current five-year-plan, which ends this year, focuses on moving away from traditional and polluting industries, boosting technological innovation, and building a moderately prosperous society. 
DECOUPLING RISKS
While a complete decoupling between the world's two largest economies is unlikely, the recalibration would deepen an inward-focused shift that followed the 2008-09 global financial crisis, which exposed the vulnerability of its export-led model.
Chinese firms have started to feel the pinch from U.S. curbs on trade and technology as the Trump administration confronts Beijing over a range of issues from its handling of the new coronavirus pandemic to the new security law in Hong Kong.
Higher U.S. tariffs have hurt Chinese exports, with shipments to the United States falling 11.1% in the first half of 2020 from a year earlier, while Washington has targeted Chinese tech giants such as Huawei [HWT.UL] and now the popular video app TikTok owned by ByteDance.
""It's impossible to completely decouple, but the near-term impact from a partial decoupling is unavoidable,"" said Xu Hongcai, deputy director of economic policy commission at China Association of Policy Science. 
Chinese leaders have pledged to open the economy wider to foreign investors, especially in high-end manufacturing, to expand its global footprint in advanced industries. 
""We should fully tap the potential of internal circulation, but this does not mean a return to seclusion,"" said Jia Kang, head of China Academy of New Supply-side Economics, a think tank.
In 1978, then Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping initiated historic reforms and opening-up policies, paving the way for the country's transformation from a diplomatically isolated backwater to the world's second-largest economy today. 
Some fear China, with per capita GDP of just over $10,000, could struggle to drive its income levels to those enjoyed by advanced economies.
Economists warn China's economy may stagnate if it fails to rise up the value chain, as it faces increasing competition from countries with advanced technologies and lower labour costs. 

""If we are always sandwiched in the middle and get squeezed harder and harder, we could slip into the middle-income trap,"" Jia said.

Australia’s central bank is returning to the government bond market after a three-month hiatus as it aims to re-anchor yields on the three-year security that it targets through its purchasing program.
Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe announced the resumption of bond buying in Tuesday’s policy statement, when the board kept its interest rate and yield target unchanged at 0.25%. Three-year yields have been “a little higher than 25 basis points over recent weeks,” he said, adding that “further purchases will be undertaken as necessary.”
Australia to Resume Bond Buying as Victoria Slows Recovery (2)
Three-year federal government bond yields dropped after the announcement and were at 0.256% late Tuesday in Sydney, having closed at 0.268% on Monday.
Christopher Kent, assistant governor who oversees financial markets at the central bank, gently signaled during a question-and-answer session after a speech last week that the RBA may re-enter the secondary market.
“We notice it’s been rising a little bit of late but it does move around from day to day, week to week,” he said of the three-year yield. “That’s something we’re watching closely and we said, if we need to, if it was to move too far away from 25, then we would stand ready to buy more.”
The RBA last purchased bonds on May 6, and had acquired A$51.35 billion ($36.7 billion) in face value of securities of various maturities issued by federal, state and territory governments since March 20, when it began purchasing notes following an emergency meeting in order to hold down borrowing costs across the economy.
The RBA halted bond buying in May as yields stabilized across the curve and money-market stresses eased. The calm in fixed-income markets allowed federal and state governments to borrow at an unprecedented pace to fund record spending aimed at countering the economic impact of the pandemic. The federal government raised A$85.6 billion last quarter, more than twice as much as the previous record for sales set in the first three months of 2017.
Australia’s currency has surged over the past four months as the RBA’s success in stabilizing markets spurred foreign demand for record debt sales.
Lowe said in Tuesday’s statement the yield target “will remain in place until progress is being made toward the goals for full employment and inflation.”
Australia’s economy slid into its first recession in almost three decades in the first half of this year as efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19 forced a shutdown of large tracts of the economy. The RBA, under a baseline scenario, sees output falling 6% in 2020 and then expanding 5% the following year.

Wholesale gasoline in rack terminal storage in North Carolina and Virginia also ticked up more than 3 cents a gallon.
The U.S. Coast Guard restricted most traffic in Delaware Bay, a critical oil transportation route that serves three refineries that provide fuel to drivers and airports across the Atlantic seaboard. The plants can process about 530,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The biggest East Coast oil port at New York remained open to traffic Tuesday morning but the Coast Guard is likely to issue further restricts as the storm gets closer.
The worst of the storm is expected to pass New York by the evening rush hour.
Nationwide gasoline demand has been roughly level since the start of July due to the re-emergence of the coronavirus after staging recovery beginning in early May. Analysts at FGE predicted last week that gasoline demand would not top 9 million barrels a day at all this year, well short of normal levels.
“Gasoline demand will be down,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA.
Government gasoline supply data published next week for the period ending August 7 should reflect a large build along the East Coast, Yawger said. Some gasoline cargoes from Europe probably raced to beat the storm, further adding to supply, he said.

1417,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 01:36PM ET</span>",Emerging Markets May Be Heading for a Covid Fiscal Crisis 2.0,"(Bloomberg) -- The monetary and fiscal stimulus that saved emerging-market asset prices this year may have lined many countries up for a new phase of the Covid-19 crisis -- a fiscal mess from which there is no easy escape.
Central banks cut interest rates and governments whacked up spending as cases of the coronavirus exploded and lock-downs slashed investment and consumer demand. While the measures have stoked a recovery in risk appetite, they may have boxed policy makers and government officials into a corner.
Eventually, “markets will turn and then look at the debt-to-GDP and say, ‘What are you going to do about this?” said Eric Baurmeister, head of emerging-market debt at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Investment Management in New York. “‘Now that we’re through the worst of it, how are you going to pay this back?’”
With little room left for further monetary stimulus, developing nations may be left in a Catch-22 of needing to spend more to revive growth, but lacking the resources to do so without digging a deeper hole of debt. Interest rates may even need to rise to defend national currencies as confidence ebbs away, undermining growth and sending asset prices lower. At the same time, the mounting economic woes could stoke political tensions.
Global debt soared to $258 trillion in the first quarter, or a record 331% of the world’s gross domestic product, according to the Institute of International Finance. For emerging markets, debt ratios rose by a record to 230% of GDP. About $3.7 trillion of emerging-market debt will come due through end-2020, with foreign currency-denominated debt accounting for nearly 17% of the total, IIF economists Emre Tiftik and Khadija Mahmood wrote.
Read: Virus-Driven Borrowing Surge Puts the World Deepest in Arrears
Brazil posted the worst primary deficit on record in June and the debt burden is expected to reach 98% of GDP by year end, according to the Economy Ministry, up from 76% last year. Colombia’s government forecasts its debt will rise to 65%-66% of GDP from 50% over the same period.
‘Turkey Scenario’
Temporary government spending programs may turn permanent and officials could start relying on easy monetary policy to fund fiscal deficits, according to David Hauner, a strategist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) in London.
A “Turkey scenario,” in which loose monetary policy stokes both growth and high inflation, weighing on the currency, may become a greater risk in other emerging nations, especially if their reserves dwindle and debt levels rise, Hauner said.
“Manifold fiscal problems have predated Covid, and the post-Covid world is likely to be fiscally challenging with political demands for more social protection and health care spending,” he wrote in a note.
Tax Increases
Yet cutting spending or raising corporate taxes brings its own risks. Such measures would weigh on growth, said Pedro Martins Junior, chief Latam equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. in Sao Paulo. While that may not materialize until 2021, it could become a headwind to company earnings, he wrote.
Pressure could also mount in the political realm if economies continue to lag, leading to a surge in populism, said Cathy Hepworth, head of emerging market debt at PGIM Fixed Income, which has $868 billion in assets under management.
“To me the biggest risk is if we don’t get the recovery in growth that we’re expecting,” she said. “If they can’t begin to grow, then that is going to limit the ability to continue to prop up these economies. The question is does that mean there is more pressure for populism?”

The IMF's External Sector Report on currencies and imbalances for the world's 30 largest economies showed that net current account balances fell by 0.2 percentage point to 2.9% of global GDP.
The Fund projected a further narrowing by 0.3% of global GDP in 2020, partly due to massive fiscal and monetary stimulus by many countries and continued pressure on trade.
""Major commodity exporters should see their current accounts going from significant surpluses to significant deficits,"" IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath said in a webcast presentation of the report.
The IMF projected that Saudi Arabia, which had a 5.9% current account surplus in 2019, will see a deficit of 4.9% in 2018 due to the collapse of oil prices and demand.
Tourism-dependent Thailand and Malaysia will see their surpluses shrink dramatically in 2020, the report showed.
The fund said the U.S. dollar's current account position in 2019, a deficit of 2.3% of GDP, was moderately weaker than warranted by economic fundamentals and would likely narrow to 2.0% in 2020. But it estimated that the dollar's real effective exchange rate was overvalued by around 11% in 2019.
China's current account surplus of 1.0% in 2019, projected to grow to 1.3% in 2020, was broadly in line with economic fundamentals, the IMF said in the report. It estimated that China's yuan was undervalued by around 2% in 2019, largely due to trade tensions with the United States, but said the assessment was ""subject to especially high uncertainty.""

China's real effective exchange rate had appreciated by 1.8% from the 2019 average through May 2020, the report showed.

1419,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>","Black-owned businesses more vulnerable to coronavirus crisis, NY Fed says","By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - Black-owned U.S. businesses have failed at a disproportionately higher rate than those owned by whites during the coronavirus epidemic possibly because they were in poorer financial shape, less prepared to tap federal aid and faced longer closures, the New York Federal Reserve said on Tuesday.
Many Black-owned businesses were already in a tough financial spot when the crisis hit, and were less equipped to outlast the prolonged business closures seen in areas with high infection rates, the New York Fed said in a report. 
""These firms had weaker financial cushions, weaker bank relationships, and preexisting funding gaps prior to the pandemic,"" Claire Kramer Mills, assistant vice president at the New York Fed and one of the authors of the study, said in a statement.
""COVID-19 has exacerbated these issues and businesses in the hardest-hit communities have witnessed huge disparities in access to federal relief funds and a higher rate of business closures.""
The study followed earlier research by Robert Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who found that the total number of Black business owners declined by 41% between February and April, compared to a 17% drop in the number of white business owners.
The New York Fed study released on Tuesday pointed to a 2019 study that found only 42% of Black-owned companies were ""financially"" healthy as of last year, based on their credit score, profitability and accumulation of net income, versus 73% of white-owned businesses, according to the New York Fed. Those financial struggles may have made some of the Black firms less comfortable seeking out loans during the epidemic, Mills and her fellow researchers noted. 
Black businesses were overall less prepared to tap small business aid quickly through the U.S. government's Paycheck Protection Program, which offered loans that could be forgiven, because many did not have strong banking relationships, the report found. 
Less than a quarter of Black-owned firms with employees had recently borrowed from a bank, according to a 2019 study by the New York Fed. And fintech firms, including online lenders which Black businesses are more likely to tap for funding, were not authorized to issue PPP loans until late in the first round of funding, the report noted. 
PPP loans were distributed at lower rates to the areas that were most affected by the virus, the New York Fed found. Some counties with a high concentration of Black-owned businesses received loans at rates below the national average of 17.7%. For example, only 7% of firms in the Bronx, New York, received PPP loans, as well as 11.3% of firms in Queens and 12.2% of firms in Prince George’s County, Maryland. 
""This tells us that a more targeted geographic focus on the hardest-hit and most underserved places is needed,"" Mills said. 
Black business ownership has taken a sharp hit during the crisis, especially in areas that were harder hit by the virus early on and faced longer business closures. In the eight states with the largest numbers of Black owners, all but two - California and Florida - saw a net decline in Black business ownership between February and June. Ohio and New York saw the most severe business closures. 

Several states saw a pickup in business activity in May and June as some areas began to reopen, but the states that re-opened later, including New York, California and Illinois, continued to see a drop in the number of Black business owners.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 09:35AM ET</span>",Israeli leaders locked in budget battle as economic crisis deepens,"By Steven Scheer and Maayan Lubell
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A stand-off between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main coalition partner over passage of Israel's budget threatens to trigger its fourth election in a little over a year amid an economic crisis fuelled by the coronavirus outbreak.
A ballot is automatically mandated if a budget is not approved by parliament by Aug. 25. Analysts are concerned that a new election and likely protracted coalition talks afterwards would have a crippling impact on an economy already expected to contract 6% this year, with unemployment now above 21%.
Such instability could also make prospects for any return to a long-dormant peace process with the Palestinians even more remote and complicate Netanyahu's bid to annex, with U.S. approval, parts of the occupied West Bank.
The budget is pivotal to a ""unity"" accord reached after an inconclusive March election. It calls for Defence Minister Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party to take over as premier from right-wing Likud chief Netanyahu in 2021.
The power-sharing pact stipulated that Israel would pass a binannual budget but Netanyahu is now calling for a 2020 budget instead. Gantz insists on sticking to the deal that was to be his insurance policy for a smooth transition of power.
Failure to resolve the dispute could provide Netanyahu with a quick way out of the deal with Gantz and enable him to remain prime minister through an election campaign, possibly as early as November or in March if a 2021 budget is not agreed.
Some analysts point to Netanyahu's corruption trial, which began in May, as a catalyst for the crisis. A snap ballot could lead to a delay in proceedings, and he could opt to pursue a law to block his prosecution if he wins another term.
""The whole issue is really mostly politics,"" said former Bank of Israel governor Karnit Flug.
UNCERTAINTY
Flug, now vice president of research at the Israel Democracy Institute, said a budget for only 2020 implied government instability, and ""that really intensifies economic uncertainty"".
Economists said that with a 2020 budget effectively covering only the last quarter, at this late stage passing a separate one for 2021 made no sense.
Cedric Berry, associate director of sovereign ratings at Fitch Ratings, said any budget delay ""would heighten concerns about Israel’s ability to implement prudent fiscal policy and erode (its) track record of debt reduction"". He said this could pressure Israel's ratings.
For Netanyahu, now in his fifth term, an election with a health crisis raging would be especially risky. But many Israeli political commentators have been sceptical from the start about his pledge to transfer power to Gantz.
""Gantz is concerned that Netanyahu is aiming to establish the pretext to bring down the government in early 2021 ... Gantz is right to be concerned,"" said Henry Rome, a senior analyst at the Eurasia Group think tank.
Flug said another election could make Israeli leaders prone to taking populist moves leading to a loss in market confidence, a rise in risk premium and damage to credit ratings.
Amid a second wave of COVID-19 infections, public trust in Netanyahu's handling of the crisis has plummeted. Thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets, demanding his resignation over the graft charges, which he denies.
But opinion polls predict a weak showing for Gantz in any new ballot, with Netanyahu still backed by a large bloc in parliament.
Denying he is pushing for an election, Netanyahu argues that an annual budget would allow the government to stream money immediately to battle the coronavirus and that a longer-term budget would include spending cuts.

Gantz dismissed that as a ""fairytale"" in an interview with the Ynet website on Tuesday, saying Israel needed a long-term fiscal plan for economic and political stability.

The move will come as part of a package of measures, including a 100 billion-pound ($131 billion) extension of asset purchases to run through to mid-2021, economists Robert Wood, Mark Capleton and Kamal Sharma said in a report published Tuesday. The central bank will also say it’s possible that rates go negative if needed.
“The BOE has, in our view, no monetary ammunition left if it believes the lower bound for bank rate is the current 0.1%,” the report said. “Downside economic risks lie ahead. With few options left we see the probability of the BOE cutting bank rate negative next year approaching 50%.”
The prospect of negative rates in the U.K. was ruled out by former BOE Governor Mark Carney, but since the Covid-crisis struck the British economy and prompted the central bank to slash rates to a record low, the idea has regained prominence.
The ongoing damage to activity, as well as the prospect of job cuts, a second wave of the virus and disruptive break from the European Union, have spurred policy makers to say they are reviewing all available stimulus tools.
Officials are unlikely to conclude this review at the “placeholder” Aug. 6 meeting, the BofA economists said. They also expect no policy changes this week, in line with all the analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, but do anticipate a decision to slow the pace of asset purchases to 4.2 billion pounds per week.
Policy makers will also reduce the rate on the Term Funding Scheme lending below zero, designed to spur bank loans to smaller businesses, they wrote.

1423,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 07:11AM ET</span>",Argentina says strikes $65 billion debt deal to break impasse,"By Tom Arnold and Adam Jourdan
LONDON/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina said on Tuesday it had reached a deal with three creditor groups to restructure $65 billion in sovereign debt, potentially helping it climb out of a damaging default and revive the recession-hit economy.
The Economy Ministry said in a statement https://www.argentina.gob.ar/sites/default/files/press_release_roa_2.pdf it would adjust some payment dates and legal clauses to sweeten what had been touted as its ""final"" proposal made in early July, without increasing the overall principal or interest payout.
A major grain producer and once one of the world's wealthiest countries, Argentina fell into its ninth sovereign default in May and is headed for an estimated 12% economic contraction this year on the back of two years of recession.
""Today (we) have reached an agreement that will allow members of the creditor groups and such other holders to support Argentina's debt restructuring proposal and grant Argentina significant debt relief,"" the ministry said.
That included the Ad Hoc Group, Argentina Creditor Committee and the Exchange Bondholder Group, a trio which united last month to oppose a previous government offer, sparking a deadlock that threatened to derail an eventual deal.
The ministry said it would extend the deadline for creditors to formally accept the new deal to Aug. 24. 
It had been set to expire on Tuesday. [nL2N2F01TT]
News of the deal helped lift the government's existing eurobonds by as much as 3 cents. They had already rallied on Monday in anticipation.
The country had been at an impasse with creditors, which included big-name funds such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Ashmore, over revamping the debt ahead of Tuesday's deadline. There was no immediate confirmation of an agreement from the creditor groups. 
But investors were cheered. 
""It is good for bondholders to be able to put this behind them and good for Argentina as it can return to a clean sheet,"" said one holder of Argentina eurobonds not affiliated with any groups, who asked not to be named.
""It helps for creditors on the NPV (net present value) but not a lot, and means Argentina will eventually be able to return to financial markets when needed.""
PAYMENT DATE CHANGES
As part of the deal, the government said it would adjust some payment dates for the new bonds set out in the offer sent to creditors on July 6. This would not raise the aggregate amount of principal or interest payments for Argentina but would enhance the proposal's value for creditors, it said.
A key issue during the restructuring talks were so-called collective action clauses (CACs), which determine how future changes can be made to bond agreements
Some bondholders, fearing Argentina would try to use the CACs to adopt the ""Pac-Man"" strategy of attempting to get them on board one at a time, had made informal contact with global bodies including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for their support to amend legal clauses.
To address creditors' proposals on the contractual framework, the government said in its statement it would adjust certain aspects of the CACs in the new bond documentation. 
Under the deal, payment dates on the new bonds will be Jan.9 and July 9, instead of March 4 and Sept. 4. The new bonds will begin amortizing in January 2025 and mature in July 2029.
New U.S. dollar and euro-denominated 2030 bonds will begin amortizing in July 2024 and mature in July 2030, Argentina said, with the first instalment in an amount equivalent to one half of each remaining instalment.
The new dollar and euro-denominated 2038 bonds to be issued in exchange for existing discount bonds will begin amortizing in July 2027 and mature in January 2038, the ministry said.
President Alberto Fernandez and Economy Minister Martin Guzman had been adamant that Argentina was unable to surpass the offer made in early July after months of talks. 
Argentina struck a $57 billion loan deal with the IMF in 2018 and has said it will seek a new program with the fund after it wraps up its talks with private creditors.

Lane's comments were likely to fuel market expectations the ECB would increase its 1.35 trillion-euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) as soon as September, when the central bank updates its economic forecasts.
He downplayed a recent rebound in economic data, warning a full recovery would take a long time and require stimulus from the ECB as well as governments to compensate for households incomes declining and jobs being destroyed.
""While there has been some rebound in economic activity, the level of economic slack remains extraordinarily high and the outlook highly uncertain,"" Lane said in a blog post. ""For our part, the ECB is committed to providing the monetary stimulus needed."" 
Lane's post broke the ECB's silence on policy matters since the ECB President Christine Lagarde's last press conference, on July 16. Since then, survey indicators continued to point to a recovery after a record slump in the second quarter of the year.
But a surge in new coronavirus cases in the United States has helped push the euro (EUR=) to its highest since mid-2018 against the dollar at $1.1908, a drawback for the euro zone, which relies on exports. 
This has fuelled market speculation for an increase in the PEPP, which was expanded and extended in June.
Lane said any change to the scheme, currently the main tool in the ECB's policy arsenal, would depend on the inflation outlook.

""The overall envelope of PEPP purchases is a core determinant of the ECB’s overall monetary stance,"" Lane said. ""The inflation outlook plays the central role in determining the appropriate monetary stance.""

1425,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 04, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Tuesday, August 4th"," By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com -- Rhetoric surrounding the potential purchase of TikTok has become heated with President Trump claiming the U.S. government wants its share, while the World Health Organisation expressed doubts about the possibility of a vaccine for the Covid-19 virus. Wall Street is set for a negative start, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one the verge of another record. BP (NYSE:BP) and Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) are other stocks to focus on at the start of trading  Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, August 4th.
1. Rhetoric surrounding TikTok becomes toxic
The tone of the conversation surrounding the potential purchase of Tik Tok’s U.S. operations by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is becoming more and more belligerent, with the move threatening to become the precursor to a larger tech war.
Microsoft said on Monday it was in talks -- reports Tuesday suggested there are other interested parties -- with ByteDance to buy parts of TikTok after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed course on a plan to ban the video-sharing app on national security grounds and gave the firms 45 days to strike a deal.
President Trump also noted Monday that the U.S. government should get a ""substantial"" cut of the sales price of the U.S. operations of the company, although it’s unclear how that would occur.
This prompted a scathing response in the state-backed China Daily newspaper, with its editorial saying that China will not accept the ""theft"" of a Chinese technology company. 
It added that the United States' ""bullying"" of Chinese tech companies was a consequence of Washington's zero-sum vision of ""American first"" and left China no choice but ""submission or mortal combat in the tech realm"", and that China had ""plenty of ways to respond if the administration carries out its planned smash and grab.”
It’s unclear what moves China has to respond, but watch this space.
2. Covid-19 “silver bullet” may never happen - WHO
The Covid-19 outbreak is showing signs of stalling in the U.S., with new cases falling below 50,000 for the second day in a row and the number of deaths dropping below one thousand a day.
That said, the U.S. government's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, on Monday said states with high coronavirus case counts should reconsider imposing lockdown restrictions, emphasizing the need to get cases to a low baseline before the fall flu season.
Additionally, senior figures at the World Health Organization warned on Monday that the road to normality would be long, and countries had to accept there might never be a ""silver bullet"" for Covid-19 in the form of a perfect vaccine.
""A number of vaccines are now in phase three clinical trials and we all hope to have a number of effective vaccines that can help prevent people from infection. However, there's no silver bullet at the moment - and there might never be,"" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Monday.
Elsewhere, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned earlier Tuesday that the world faces a ""generational catastrophe"" because of school closures amid the coronavirus pandemic and said that getting students safely back to the classroom must be ""a top priority.""
3. Apple helps tech sector soar
U.S. stock markets are seen opening a touch lower Tuesday, consolidating after more strong gains Monday, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq index which posted another record close.
By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 44 points or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was 0.3% lower.
Apple set an all-time high Monday, and the iPhone maker is now a few share points away from registering a two trillion dollar market capitalization. The share price to look out for is $467.77, before the company undergoes a 4-for-1 share split, compared with Monday’s $435.75 closing level.
Helping the tone were reports the White House was considering acting on its own to boost unemployment benefits, with the stalemate in Washington meaning many citizens are currently missing out on $600 a week payments.
This indicates many investors are waiting on news from Washington, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin indicated that talks on Monday on a new virus relief package yielded “a little bit” of progress.
4. BP continues Big Oil’s tale of woe
BP cut its dividend for the first time in a decade Tuesday, to 5.25 cents per share, continuing the string of weak results from the oil sector as the coronavirus pandemic weighed heavily.
The British oil giant said it lost $16.8 billion in the second quarter after taking a charge of $10.9 billion, mostly for writing down the value of various projects after the steep fall in oil prices. Its underlying replacement cost loss was $6.7 billion, compared with a profit of $2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter.
The one saving grace for the company was its trading division, which delivered an “exceptionally strong result,” BP said. 
European rivals Total, Shell (LON:RDSa) and Equinor have also all reported healthy trading gains, helping their bottom lines in these difficult times, while American counterparts  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), which are not as robust with their trading, posted their worst set of quarterly results of the modern era.
5. Electric vehicle sector also includes Nikola
The U.S. earnings season continues Tuesday, and one company that may be in the spotlight Tuesday is Nikola which releases its second quarter numbers.
While Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has taken most of the limelight in the electric vehicle sector,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said in a note on Monday that the electric truck maker could be worth a buy ahead of its latest update. Among the things investors are hoping to learn more about are the customer pipeline for Nikola's electric semi, its plans to build a hydrogen refueling network, and a manufacturing partner for its Badger pickup truck, according to Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner.
Nikola stock is up 11% this week, but down over 36% this month.

BdB and the public prosecutor's Cologne office said that the investigations are not directed against officials of the lobby group.
""The purpose of the search is to find evidence that may be relevant to the continuation of the investigation and the further clarification of the complex facts,"" the prosecutors office said.
The investigators suspect that defendants in several criminal proceedings tried to influence lawmaking to keep loopholes opens for the sham trades, using BdB's influence in Berlin, daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported.
These so called ""cum-ex"" trades thrived between 2005 and 2012 and allowed investors around the world to target chiefly German companies to generate multiple tax reclaims from phantom dividends, costing the taxpayers more than 10 billion euros until loopholes were closed.
The public prosecutors are not investigating BdB officials, but are hoping to find evidence on the possible exertion of influence on BdB managers by the criminals involved in the sham trades, Sueddeutsche reported.
Prosecutors said they could not give any further information in view of the ongoing investigation.
A parliamentary fact-finding committee had probed BdB's potential involvement in 2016/17, but had been unable to access emails and documents from BdB, it added.

Ukraine was one of Russia's largest consumers of natural gas until the relations between the two ex-Soviet republics soured in 2014 when Moscow annexed Crimea peninsula from its neighbour.
Kyiv stopped buying Russian gas in November 2015, increasing purchases from Europe instead.
Ukraine has embarked on natural gas market reforms, including scrapping of state-regulated gas prices for industrial users. The reform is one of the prerequisites for much-needed financing from the International Monetary Fund.
""Reform of the Ukrainian gas market has created an opportunity for any Ukrainian or foreign trader to buy gas from Russia, should prices and conditions be competitive. But, so far, Russia hasn't offered gas under these terms,"" Andriy Kobolyev, Naftogaz's chief executive told Reuters in an email. 
""Ukraine will never go back to the days of corrupt energy deals and energy dependence on Russia, and they know that.""
Russian and Ukrainian companies signed a five-year deal at the end of 2019, safeguarding the transit of Russian gas to Europe via Ukraine, just hours before the previous agreement expired.

Kobolyev said Russian pipeline gas exporting monopoly Gazprom (MM:GAZP) transited 25 billion cubic metres of gas through Ukraine in the first half of 2020, 45% less than over the same period of 2019.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi will visit Britain this week for what he said will be difficult talks with British Trade Minister Liz Truss, with the hope of finding middle ground and concluding a post-Brexit trade deal.
""It is indispensable to swiftly form a framework for trade and investment between Japan and Britain that will replace the Japan-EU EPA to ensure the smooth continuation of bilateral businesses,"" Motegi told reporters on Tuesday, referring to an economic partnership agreement with the EU.
The two countries hope to clinch a deal before Britain’s transition out of the European Union concludes at the year end, to avoid any gaps in bilateral trade arrangements.
Motegi's Aug. 5-7 visit to Britain will be the first overseas trip for any Japanese government minister since the global spread of the novel coronavirus, he said.
""Difficult negotiations such as this, where national interest is at stake, cannot be conducted over the telephone,"" he told a regular news conference.
""We will negotiate face-to-face. I'm afraid negotiations will last many hours, but I would like to find middle ground and reach an agreement.""
Motegi, asked about the Hong Kong government's postponement of a city legislative election, said he had ""grave concerns"" about the issue.
""It is important for Hong Kong to develop in a democratic and stable manner, while its free and open structure is maintained under the 'one country, two systems' principle. That's Japan's consistent stance,"" he said.
""Holding a free and fair election without delay is an important basis for that. Japan would like to keep an eye on the situation surrounding the Hong Kong legislature election while cooperating closely with other countries concerned.""
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Friday postponed the Sept. 6 election to the Chinese-ruled city's legislature by a year, citing the public health risk from the novel coronavirus.

The pro-democracy opposition in the former British colony had been hoping to win a historic majority in the legislature.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan needs to consider extending a special subsidy aimed at helping companies hit by the coronavirus pandemic to keep furloughed workers on the payroll, an official from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) said late on Monday.
LDP's Fumio Kishida, who is seen as a candidate to become the country's next prime minister, made the remark after data last Friday showed job availability hit a near six-year low in June.
Japan's job market has been cooling and millions of people have been furloughed as the spread of the coronavirus forced businesses to close and people to stay home through May.
Policymakers are having to balance containing the virus with the need to resume economic activity as the world's third largest economy faces its first recession in 4-1/2 years. Japan's lockdown restrictions were lifted late in May.
""The job market remains severe when looking at figures such as the jobs-to-applicants ratio. We need to consider extending the special measure for employment adjustment subsidy,"" Kishida, LDP's head of policy affairs, told a news conference.
The special measure was designed to temporarily lift the payment to companies who keep employment to up to 15,000 yen ($141.40) per employee per day from up to 8,330 yen previously, for six months through to the end of September.
Lawmakers worry that the end of the special measure next month could trigger a spike in job losses as many companies may not be able to keep surplus labour given dwindling profits.
A junior coalition ally, the Komeito party, also proposed on Friday that the government extend the special subsidy measure beyond September.
Some 2.36 million people were furloughed as of June, up 0.9 million from a year earlier, government data showed.

Azusa Kato, senior economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Securities, said the jobless rate could approach 4% from the current 2.8% by the end of the year.

Only 29% of credit and political risk insurers had seen claims directly related to the virus so far, the survey of underwriters, conducted in June and July, showed.
Companies or lenders buy credit insurance to get cover for non-payment for goods or services.
Pandemic-related credit insurance claims are, however, likely to rise later this year or early next year, as businesses struggle to stave off default, said Matthew Solley, managing director of structured credit and political risks at Gallagher.
Aviation, oil and energy, and tourism were the three sectors in their portfolios that concerned insurers the most.
Virgin Australia, Air Mauritius and Colombia-based Avianca are among airlines to have ceased operations in the past few months, with planes grounded by lockdowns around the world.
Insurers also worry about non-payment by governments, with Zambia seen the biggest risk.
In the broader political risk insurance market, which can cover issues ranging from expropriation to war, Argentina was seen as the biggest concern.

The survey of 76 underwriters from 46 firms in Lloyd's of London and the broader London commercial insurance market was carried out between June 24 and July 9.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank held its cash rate at an all-time low on Tuesday, predicting the economic recovery will likely be both 'uneven' and 'bumpy' as the country's second biggest state locks down to fight a resurgence of the coronavirus.
In an ominous sign that underscored policymakers' cautious stance, data out earlier showed retail sales volumes suffered their biggest plunge in two decades in the second quarter and analysts warned spending will remain depressed for some time yet.
On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said its emergency stimulus was 'working as expected' while leaving its cash rate at 0.25% in a widely expected decision. 
The RBA, however, painted a gloomy picture for the coming months, predicting the jobless rate would spike to 10% later this year due to further job losses in Victoria which is struggling to contain a second wave of infections.
Unemployment is seen staying elevated around current levels of 7% over the next couple of years. Given the spare capacity, the RBA expects inflation to continue to undershoot its 2% to 3% medium-term target over the next two years.
The central bank will release its detailed quarterly outlook on Friday.
""The Australian economy is going through a very difficult period and is experiencing the biggest contraction since the 1930s,"" RBA Governor Philip Lowe said in a post-meeting statement.
""As difficult as this is, the downturn is not as severe as earlier expected and a recovery is now underway in most of Australia,"" Lowe added. 
""This recovery is, however, likely to be both uneven and bumpy with the coronavirus outbreak in Victoria having a major effect on the Victorian economy.""
Victoria declared a ""state of disaster"" this week following a relentless surge in coronavirus infections since late June. 
The RBA forecast a 6% drop in gross domestic product over 2020, and then expects 5% growth over the following year. 
Consumer spending is proving to be one of the biggest drags on the economy, with the larger-than-expected 3.4% drop in second quarter retail volumes seen subtracting a hefty 0.6 percentage points from growth in that period. 
In contrast to retailers, Australia's exporters have been going gangbusters thanks to demand from China for iron ore and other resources, while imports have been hammered by the lockdowns. 
Separate data on Tuesday showed the trade surplus swelled to A$8.2 billion in June, taking the total for the second quarter to a whopping A$23.4 billion.
Still, economists warned the outlook was further clouded by the coronavirus woes in Victoria, with weekly spending data by the country's major banks already showing signs of moderation.
""Victoria’s return to hard lock-down changes everything...(and) presents a significant risk of Victoria dragging down growth in national activity data in the last two months of Q3,"" said Citi economist Josh Williamson. 

""We could also see negative confidence impacts drag on data in other states, particularly as other states have used the rise in Victorian COVID-19 cases to defer opening their borders or sought to tighten access to some states.""

The total amount of loans deferred stood at A$274 billion as at 30 June, up from A$230 billion a month earlier.
The COVID-19 pandemic has knocked the Australian economy into its first recession in three decades and forced policymakers to roll out hundreds of billions of dollars in stimulus.
Last month, the Australian Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulation Authority (APRA) said banks will extend the loan repayment deferral period to 10 months from six.
The extension from a previous end-date of September reflects concerns that economic repercussions from the pandemic will continue when current government income support expires.
APRA said in a statement that housing loans were granted the most deferrals, although loans for small businesses had a higher incidence of repayment deferral with 17% compared to 11% for housing loans.
The number of loans returning to a performing status however surged during June.
Figures released by APRA show around A$18 billion worth of loans exited from repayment deferrals in June, significantly higher than the A$2 billion in May.

Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said 300 “shovel-ready” projects will receive a share of a 900 million pound Getting Building Fund, and a further 360 million pounds will go toward homes on previously developed “brownfield” land.
The U.K.’s construction industry was stalled by the coronavirus pandemic earlier this year and rebooting the sector could help ease unemployment and generate revenue as the country faces its worst recession for 300 years. The building fund is expected to deliver 45,000 new homes and the brownfield program 26,000, the government said.
“As we get Britain building we are also laying the foundations for a green recovery by investing in vital infrastructure for local communities, creating jobs and building environmentally-friendly homes,” Jenrick said in an emailed statement.
Among the projects that will receive funding is a new high-speed railway station at Thanet, on England’s south east coast, and a new commercial space in Manchester, north west England. Across all the funded projects, the government estimates the investment will create 85,000 new jobs.
The details of the Green Homes Grant program, helping 600,000 homeowners to make their properties more energy efficient, were announced at the same time. The grants will cover as much as 5,000 pounds of work. Lower income households can claim as much as 10,000 pounds each.
The program will cover insulation and double-glazing, as well as the installation of ground source heat pumps, energy efficient doors and heat controls. Households will be offered a list of approved tradespeople within their local area to carry out the work, and vouchers will be issued from September.
The grants will “help to protect and create jobs, while also saving people money and cutting carbon,” Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said in an emailed statement.

1438,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 08:18PM ET</span>",Victoria’s Spiraling Crisis Likely to Prolong Australia’s Recession,"(Bloomberg) -- Victoria’s spiraling Covid-19 outbreak and the closure of large tracts of the southeastern state’s economy is likely to prolong Australia’s first recession in almost three decades.
A curfew in Melbourne, the shuttering of swathes of the retail and manufacturing sectors and tight limits on construction for six weeks are set to result in another quarterly contraction in gross domestic product, said Terry Rawnsley at consultancy SGS Economics & Planning.
The economy contracted 0.3% in the first quarter, likely declined about 7% in the second and probably 4-5% in the third, said Rawnsley, one of the foremost economists on Australia’s regions. “This has sort of confirmed that we’re going to have three consecutive quarters of decline in GDP,” he said. “It’s a pretty grim run of economic news.”
The outbreak in Victoria, which accounts for almost a quarter of Australia’s GDP, threatens to overwhelm a recovery in other parts of Australia. The effective isolation of the state and sporadic outbreaks in neighboring New South Wales are likely to start eroding confidence in the rest of Australia, which had been in the vanguard of nations enjoying early success in flattening the curve of new infections.
Melbourne’s outbreak has shown no signs of abating, three weeks after the city’s 5 million residents were ordered to stay at home except for essential work, exercise, medical care or provisions. The Victoria government has now imposed an 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew, widened the lockdown across the entire state and on Monday announced the most stringent workplace restrictions since the crisis began.
Capital Economics Ltd. reckons Victoria’s new measures will cut Australia’s third-quarter GDP by about 1.5%, or double the Treasury’s 0.75 percentage point reduction forecast in the economic and fiscal update released just under two weeks ago.
“Output could fall even further if the surge in cases in Victoria isn’t brought under control by the end of the third quarter or if other states experience a similar spike in cases and need to reimpose restrictions on activity,” said Marcel Thieliant, senior economist for Australia at Capital Economics. On his current estimates, the national economy will expand “a measly 0.5%” in the third quarter.
Premier Daniel Andrews on Monday said the new restrictions would see an additional 250,000 workers forced to stay home. Construction firms must radically reduce worker numbers on sites, while production at meatworks statewide will be cut by a third. Essential services such as banks, supermarkets, pharmacies and petrol stations will remain open, he said.
Australia’s Treasury Secretary Steven Kennedy told a parliamentary panel last week that the economy likely contracted by 7% in the second quarter.

1439,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>",Fed policymakers call for fiscal support to save U.S. economy,"By Ann Saphir and Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Dunsmuir
(Reuters) - The U.S. economy, battered by a resurgence in the spread of COVID-19, needs increased government spending to tide over households and businesses and broader use of masks to better control the virus, U.S. central bankers said on Monday. 
The calls for increased government intervention came as U.S. lawmakers and the White House resumed talks on a new government relief package, including a possible extension of unemployment benefits that expired on Friday.
""The ball is in Congress’ court,"" Chicago Fed President Charles Evans told reporters on a call. ""Fiscal policy is fundamental to a better baseline outlook, to a stronger recovery and getting the unemployment rate down, people back to work safely, and ultimately reopening the schools safely.""
Without more government aid, Evans said, ""aggregate demand trouble is brewing."" Translated for non-economists: people could stop spending and the bottom could really fall out of the economy. 
Or, as Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin put it, ""quickly pulling away the support that consumers and businesses are receiving would be a pretty traumatic move for what's happening in the economy."" 
The full court Fed press for more government spending came as Republicans appeared reluctant to spend much more than the $3 trillion Congress had already committed to bolstering the economy in the face of the virus. But things have gotten worse since then, Barkin said. 
""Four months ago, when we did the first stimulus, we thought the economy faced a pothole and the stimulus put a plate over it so we could navigate,"" he told the Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce. ""Now escalation of the virus may be making that pothole into a sinkhole and creating a need for a longer plate.""
Echoing those sentiments in slightly different terms were Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard. Kaplan pushed back on the notion that the extra $600 weekly benefits to the unemployed had made it harder for businesses to hire, while Bullard said earlier efforts to keep businesses and households whole through the crisis have paid off so far.
""We've looked at a number of studies, we've done our own work: we don't see it as much in the data but I can tell you I'm hearing it from business people,"" Kaplan told Bloomberg TV earlier Monday when asked about whether the enhanced jobless aid was deterring people from returning to work. 
""While it may have made it hard for certain individual businesses to hire, it has helped create jobs, because it has helped bolster consumer spending, so the net effect still has probably been positive for the economy for employment.""
Kaplan also said he did not agree with his colleague, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who at the weekend said he thought the U.S. economy should shut back down again for four to six weeks to suppress spread of COVID-19. 
Instead, Kaplan said, universal mask-wearing could substantially mute transmission of the virus without a widespread lockdown. ""I think we are going to have to learn to live with this virus. We are going to have to learn to re-engage in our daily activities but still control the virus,"" he said. ""Widespread mask-wearing is essential to that."" 
Bullard, too, emphasized mask-wearing as a significant risk-management tool, especially as he does not expect health officials to be able to reduce disease transmissions to zero because it is so contagious. He also warned against placing too much emphasis on the development of a successful vaccine.
""If you put too much emphasis on the idea that a vaccine is going to come and save us, and someone's going to crack a very difficult scientific problem ... then you get people not doing anything and sitting around waiting for the vaccine,"" Bullard said in a presentation during an online event hosted by the bank's Memphis, Tennessee, branch. ""So if you do that, you do risk a depression because you could get a lot of business failures while you're waiting, potentially a very long time for a vaccine to come and save the day.""
The regional bank presidents' comments came just days after the Fed's latest two-day policy meeting, at which officials repeated their pledge to do all in their power to help the economy weather the recession that began in February as the outbreak began ricocheting around the globe. The U.S. central bank has slashed interest rates to near zero - where they are expected to remain for years - and has rolled out roughly a dozen emergency programs to backstop financial markets and support businesses.
Bullard also said he expects that economic growth has resumed in the current third quarter, but that after a better-than-expected start to the rebound in May and June, the rebound slowed in July with the resurgence in infections in many areas of the country.
""We shouldn't expect a completely smooth transition as you go forward because this is a crisis and there's going to be ups and downs,"" Bullard said.
Those swings were on display Monday, as U.S. manufacturing activity rose even as factory job losses persisted. California - the most populous U.S. state - reported a decline in hospitalizations and cases, but the state's farmbelt has a severe outbreak, concentrated among Latinos. 
Evans, in an uncharacteristically passionate outburst during his call with reporters, said that the virus' unequal toll was an ""indictment"" of unequal access to U.S. healthcare. 
""The state of equal healthcare in this country is abysmal,"" he said.

1440,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>",Argentina's $65 billion debt deal draws near on eve of deadline,"By Eliana Raszewski, Rodrigo Campos and Adam Jourdan
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina and its creditors are nearing a breakthrough $65 billion debt restructuring deal, a lawmaker and two sources told Reuters on Monday, the eve of a deadline for a deal that would help avert a damaging legal standoff.
The South American country has been at an impasse with creditors including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Ashmore, over proposals to revamp the debt ahead of the Aug. 4 deadline. Last month, the main creditor groups had rejected the country's ""final"" offer and rallied behind a counterproposal.
Ruling party deputy Fernanda Vallejos told Reuters in a message that a deal was ""near to closing"" after Economy Minister Martin Guzman met with lawmakers.
""He gave us reason to feel optimistic that there are significant chances of success in closing the negotiation,"" she added.
A source close to the negotiation said a deal has been ""struck"" between creditors and the government.
A second person close to the talks said Argentina and creditors were holding discussions ""as we speak"" toward an agreement to bridge the gap of around 3 cents on the dollar between the latest rival proposals.
That would value the offer near 54.8 cents, the person added. The Economy Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
""Rumors are full and the markets are flying. It will be several hours until they say exactly how everything is coming,"" one official source told Reuters.
Local publication Clarin reported, citing sources, that Guzman had made an amended proposal to creditors tweaking coupon payment dates.
Mounting expectations for a deal lifted the country's sovereign bonds around 1% in the afternoon, reversing an early decline. An index of Argentine stocks that trade on Wall Street rose 8.7% to close at its highest in five months.
The government has been weighing whether to extend negotiations until later in August and would likely need to extend the Tuesday deadline to formalize any preliminary agreement.
President Alberto Fernandez and Guzman had been adamant that recession-hit Argentina was unable to surpass an offer made in early July after months of talks.
""We can't offer creditors more,"" Guzman told local outlet Pagina12 on Sunday. 
""If there's no deal we will advance with the IMF on a new program and come back to talk with the private sector in six or eight months, but with a deeper restructuring proposal.""
Last month, Reuters reported that the government may bend on legal terms, while one source had said Argentina may find ways to improve its offer without increasing cash flow.
Argentina, a major grains producer that has been in default since May, struck a $57 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund in 2018.
Argentina's largest province, Buenos Aires, did extend the deadline on its own $7 billion debt talks until Aug. 14 on Monday after a previous date of July 31 passed without a deal.

1441,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 05:27PM ET</span>",Fed Officials Talk Up Urgency of Fiscal Aid as Lawmakers Bicker,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve officials warned Monday that another round of fiscal relief would be critical for the U.S. economy as lawmakers continued to negotiate the contours of additional aid.
Tens of millions of Americans who lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic have in recent months relied on the enhanced unemployment insurance payments authorized by Congress in March to pay their bills and put food on the table, while temporary moratoriums on evictions have kept roofs over their heads.
“It’s very important that something be done,” Chicago Fed President Charles Evans told reporters Monday. “If we go very long without somehow addressing the reduction and evaporation of that support, I think it’s going to show up in lower aggregate demand, and that would be very costly for the economy.”
Lawmakers allowed the enhanced payments of $600 a week to expire on July 31 and have yet to agree on an extension. The lapse comes as high-frequency indicators suggest the economic recovery is at risk of stalling out due to renewed outbreaks across the country.
Democrats in Congress want to extend the $600 payments -- which were added to regular unemployment insurance benefits as part of the package passed in March -- through January. Republicans argue the payments should be reduced because they are too generous and discourage people from returning to work.
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said earlier Monday that the enhanced benefits would need to be extended in some form and added that the extra spending power they’ve been providing to households have probably kept more people employed than would otherwise be the case.
“The increased incomes, while it may have made it harder for certain individual businesses to hire, it’s helped create jobs because it’s helped bolster consumer spending, so the net effect still has probably been positive for the economy and for employment,” Kaplan told Michael McKee in a Bloomberg Television interview.
His Richmond Fed colleague Thomas Barkin made a similar point.
“Quickly pulling away the support that consumers and businesses are receiving would be a pretty traumatic move for what’s happening in the economy,” he said in a separate event Monday
Forward Guidance
Central bankers are underscoring the need for lawmakers to take action in part because the Fed has already slashed its benchmark interest rate to nearly zero. Evans said monetary policy would have a bigger impact once the economy began to rebound again because low rates would help encourage businesses and households to borrow and invest more.
Fed officials are currently debating whether to enhance their public guidance about the future path of rates by tying it to specific thresholds for unemployment and inflation, a move Fed watchers expect to come after the central bank’s next policy meeting in September.
“Unless inflation starts heading up to like 2.5%, I’m not going to really see a need for the funds rate to be increasing as long as we can still drive unemployment lower, that we can get more people into the workforce, we can recover from some of what we’ve just sort of experienced, and get everybody back on their feet,” Evans said. “So, I think that’s the kind of forward guidance I know I would be arguing for.”

(Reuters) - Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans on Monday called forcefully for more U.S. government spending to support the economy, saying it is up to lawmakers and the White House to put the job market back on track toward health.
""Aggregate demand trouble is brewing with the expiration of these relief policies,"" including supplemental jobless benefits and a national moratorium on evictions that ended last month, Evans told reporters on a call. ""The punch line ought to be, 'the ball is in Congress’ court.' Fiscal policy is really fundamental for getting us going forward."" 
In making that point Evans joined several other Fed policymakers on Monday, even as congressional Democrats and Trump administration officials made little progress on crafting a coronavirus relief bill to follow a $2.3 trillion package passed in March. [L1N2F5153]
""If we go very long without somehow addressing the reduction and evaporation of that support, I think it’s going to show up in lower aggregate demand, and that would be very costly for the economy, individuals, households, people,"" Evans said. 
Under his baseline forecast, the U.S. unemployment rate - now at 11% - will fall to 9.5% by year's end and to 6.5% by the end of 2021, well above where it ought to be in a healthy economy, he said. Worse trajectories are ""equally"" as likely, he said. 
Evans said easing monetary policy further would really only be effective once the path of the virus is clearer and the economy looks further on the way to full employment, perhaps by the spring of 2021. 

""Monetary policy is about where it can be,"" he said. ""At the moment, it’s really fiscal policy that needs to be addressing this.""

1443,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 03:18PM ET</span>",U.S. Treasury Lifts Quarterly Borrowing Estimate to $947 Billion,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Treasury said it expects to raise $947 billion in debt over the three months through September to fund the massive and continuing spending surge to address the coronavirus crisis.
The figure, released in Washington Monday, is $270 billion higher than the Treasury projected in May, when it expected to borrow $677 billion of net marketable debt in the quarter. Since then, Covid-19 cases have surged to records in many states, disrupting economic reopening moves and forcing Congress to negotiate on another round of fiscal stimulus.
The Treasury said its numbers assume $1 trillion of “additional borrowing need in anticipation of additional legislation being passed.” That’s roughly the amount Republicans have proposed for a new virus-relief bill. But the Democratic-controlled House previously approved a $3.5 trillion package, and the two sides remain at loggerheads.
Republican lawmakers have sharpened their focus on the possible impact on a federal budget deficit that the Congressional Budget Office already sees hitting a record $3.7 trillion in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.
The new borrowing figure is based on an estimated Treasury cash balance of $800 billion for the end of September, unchanged from the May projection. That figure last week hit an all-time high, exceeding $1.8 trillion -- partly a reflection of expected costs in coming months related to forgiving loans to small businesses to help keep them going amid the recession.
The Treasury also said that borrowing surged to an unprecedented $2.753 trillion in April through June, when the Treasury was funding the largest stimulus in modern history.
Read this for more on the money market impact of the Treasury cash balance
For the three months through December, the Treasury anticipates selling $1.216 trillion in net marketable debt, assuming a cash balance of $800 billion at the end of the calendar year.
Monday’s borrowing estimates precede the Treasury’s so-called quarterly refunding announcement on Wednesday, when the department releases plans for the sizes of auctions of longer-term debt, along with any shifts in its issuance strategy. Wall Street widely expects the Treasury to skew more of its record-breaking issuance to the longer end of the Treasury curve.

1444,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 02:50PM ET</span>","U.S. economic recovery appears to have slowed in July, Fed's Bullard says","By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - The U.S. economic recovery from the coronavirus-induced recession likely slowed in July after surprising to the upside in May and June, and the trajectory from here is unlikely to be smooth, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on Monday.
Bullard, in a presentation during an online event hosted by the St. Louis Fed's branch in Memphis, Tennessee, said it appears as though the trough in economic activity occurred in April. 
""I think the slowdown in July would be consistent with the idea that we shouldn’t expect a completely smooth transition as you go forward because this is a crisis and there’s going to be ups and downs,"" Bullard said. 
Bullard said putting too much emphasis on the need for a vaccine could lead more consumers to stay home, prompt an increase in business failures and cause severe damage to the economy. 
""You don't want to cause a depression while you're causing people to expect a vaccine to suddenly come on the scene and save the day,"" he said. 
Instead, Bullard pushed for broader use of masks, and more rapidly available testing that can help people feel more comfortable with flying and other activities that requires them to be in close proximity to others. 
Speaking to reporters after the event, Bullard said projections show that widespread use of masks can help bring infections and fatalities down to manageable levels throughout the United States. 

Bullard said he expects Congress to reach a deal on another aid package for businesses and households affected by the virus, even though negotiations are tense. ""The incentives are very strong for both sides to come to a deal, and the question is what exactly would be in that deal,"" Bullard said.

Under the terms of an ongoing transition period, customs and border arrangements have remained unchanged since Britain left the European Union on Jan. 31, but new checks are expected to come into force when the transition ends on Dec. 31.
""We recognise that global supply chains are under significant pressure, exacerbated by recent events with COVID-19,"" the health ministry said in a letter to medicine suppliers which it published on Monday.
""However, we encourage companies to make stockpiling a key part of contingency plans, and ask industry, where possible, to stockpile to a target level of six weeks' total stock on UK soil.""
Britain and the EU are negotiating the terms of a new free trade agreement, but it is not clear whether a deal will be agreed and implemented before the Dec. 31 deadline, reviving fears of a disruptive ""hard Brexit"".
The government letter outlined the multiple pressures that the National Health Service (NHS) would be facing by winter.
""The ongoing pandemic, gradual resumption of NHS activity, and seasonal pressures, mean we must prepare thoroughly for the end of the transition period,"" it said.
To ensure continuity of patient care, medicine suppliers should prepare to reroute freight away from potential disruption points, especially the crossings between Dover (NYSE:DOV) and Folkestone on the English side and Calais, Coquelles and Dunkirk in France.
""Companies are encouraged to review their own logistics arrangements and consider making plans for avoiding the short straits as a matter of priority,"" the letter said.
The health ministry stood ready to support companies with their plans if needed.
The ministry said it had built up a centralised stock of fast-moving medical devices and clinical consumables in the run-up to the exit from the EU on Jan. 31.

""Some of this stock remains and accounting for likely demand trends for the time of year, we plan to build these levels back up to a target level of six weeks' total stock,"" it said.

1446,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>","With eye on China, India looks to increase barriers on imports from Asia","By Aftab Ahmed
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - New Delhi is considering measures to prevent trade partners mainly in Southeast Asia from re-routing Chinese goods to India with little added value, two government sources said, amid strained ties with Beijing and a push for self-reliance.
India is planning to raise quality standards of imports, impose quantity restrictions, mandate stringent disclosure norms and initiate more frequent checks at ports of entry for goods coming from many Asian countries, the officials said, declining to be named as they were not authorised to talk to the media.
The moves will mainly target imports of base metals, electronic components for laptops and mobile phones, furniture, leather goods, toys, rubber, textiles, air conditioners and televisions, among other items, the officials said.
Last week, India's trade ministry issued a notice to restrict inbound shipments of TVs by requiring importers to get a special licence.
The moves are expected to primarily hurt Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore - members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with which India has a free trade agreement (FTA). India is also worried about heavy trade flows from South Korea.
""Raising duties has a limited impact,"" said one of the officials. ""Now we want to raise quality standards and also make sure that goods in FTA routes have roots in those countries. So customs would be more vigilant than before.""
India's trade ministry did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.
The government will also discuss raising the value-addition requirement for products imported from those countries from the current level of 20%-40%, the official said, adding FTAs could be reviewed too.
""A lot of the Asian partners have become a place from where just Chinese goods are routed. We are going product by product to design various kinds of action, most of which will be on non-tariff lines,"" the official added.
India has long had an uneasy relationship with China and a Himalayan border dispute escalated into the worst clash in decades in June. India said 20 of its soldiers were killed.
China is also India’s second-biggest trading partner, with trade worth $87 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2019, and a trade deficit of $53.57 billion in China’s favour, the widest India has with any country.
Thai and Malaysian authorities said they had not received any official communication on the issues of raising non-tariff barriers or re-routing of goods.
Thailand's trade ministry said in a statement to Reuters that the ASEAN treaty should be reviewed to make it more liberal in terms of tariff liberalization and rules of origin and to have simpler customs and verification procedures. 
Meanwhile, Indian officials said the government was inclined to only stick to those FTAs that it deems mutually beneficial. India has a trade deficit with most of the countries it has signed FTAs with. 

""Very clearly in ASEAN agreements India has got, in many respects, the bad end of the stick, particularly in the field of electronics where we now find a number of products are being routed through the ASEAN economies to India,"" said George Paul, CEO of the Manufacturers’ Association for Information Technology.

1447,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>",Italy enjoys oversized ECB support as debt balloons,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Italy enjoyed oversized purchases of its government debt by the European Central Bank in June and July, standing out as the main beneficiary of ECB efforts to support the virus-stricken euro zone economy, data showed on Monday. 
The ECB bought 36 billion euros worth of Italian sovereign bonds under its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, giving it a 19.6% share of the scheme against Italy's 17% quota.
In addition, the central bank hoovered up a further 10.2 billion euros as part of its deflation-fighting Public Sector Purchase Programme, or nearly a quarter of all national debt bought under that scheme in the last two months.
That made Italy the one large euro zone country to be above its share of the capital key - a quota based on how much money each country has paid into ECB coffers - in both programmes. 
While all euro zone governments have been pumping cash into their economies since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, Italy went into this crisis with already high public debt and meagre economic growth.

Rome is planning on running a budget deficit of almost 12% of its national output this year, taking its government debt to an estimated 157.6% of GDP.

1448,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>",Go your own way: U.S. and UK bonds part ways from Germany and Japan,"By Dhara Ranasinghe and Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - Sovereign borrowing costs have taken another lurch lower as more COVID-19 outbreaks threaten economic recovery, yet five months after the pandemic panic first hit, a divergence is opening up within four of the world's biggest bond markets.
While yields across the developed world are near record lows, U.S. and British borrowing costs are falling faster than those in Europe or Japan, suggesting domestic economic conditions are playing a bigger role.
The U.S. 30-year bond yield  fell some 20 basis points in July, setting the stage for the entire Treasury curve to drop below 1% for a sustained period. 
Ten-year yields (US10YT=RR) are near their lowest since March, down 55 basis points in this period. 
In contrast, yields on German 10-year debt, the euro zone benchmark, are in fact up 10 bps (DE10YT=RR) while Japanese yields have risen around 15 bps .

""(U.S./German bond divergence) does have to do with growth expectations, given the contrast in success in dealing with COVID-19 and what this means for re-openings going forward,"" said Mohammed Kazmi, a portfolio manager at UBP.
""There is a fiscal component here as well, where the U.S. is still struggling to pass another fiscal bill... In Europe, for now furlough schemes are still in place, whilst the EU Recovery Fund passing also boosts hope for more spending in the years ahead.""
He was referring to the European Union's game-changing agreement on establishing a 750 billion euro fund to reduce the damage from the pandemic.
Graphic: Narrowing that gap - bond yield spreads against U.S. Treasuries narrow sharply - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmvjreeavr/spreads0308.png
U.S. debt levels are soaring, too -- Fitch ratings agency cited eroding credit strength as a reason for downgrading its U.S. ratings outlook on Friday -- but currently, lawmakers are struggling to agree on a new stimulus plan.
Their reluctance to extend an unemployment supplement scheme could also derail recovery from a recession that saw the economy contract an annualised 33% in the second quarter.
But the bigger dynamic at play may be speculation that U.S. and British interest rates will fall below 0%, further squeezing their bonds' yield premium over Germany and Japan, where borrowing costs went negative years ago.

1449,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 10:40AM ET</span>",U.S. long bond demand raises prospect of whole curve yielding below 1%,"By Ross Kerber and Karen Pierog
BOSTON/CHICAGO, August 3 (Reuters) - A decline in U.S. Treasury yields over recent weeks has investors eyeing the approach of an unusual phenomenon - the entire U.S. yield curve sinking below 1%. 
Policymakers are looking to position the country to recover once the COVID-19 pandemic eases and allows the Fed to raise interest rates again. But those steps look a long way off as the virus continues to spread and talks on a new aid bill in Washington drag out.
""Everybody thinks the Fed is going to be running rates near zero indefinitely. That’s bringing down the 30-year bond yield to incredibly low rates,"" said Brian Bethune, chief economist for Alpha Economic Foresights LLC.
The 30-year U.S. Treasury (US30YT=RR), at around 1.25%, was still more than 25 basis points away as of Monday, rebounding from Friday when it touched its lowest since April. 
Tradeweb noted last week that the decline in the 30-year yield meant that the entire yield curve was moving close to being sub 1%. 
""I think the downward pressure on yields will continue for the foreseeable future,"" Nick Maroutsos, co-head of global bonds for Janus Henderson, who said that given where global yields trade outside the United States, ""it’s only a matter of time before the entire U.S. curve trades below 1%."" 
Maroutsos said it was a ""sign that investors are reaching for any yield they can get regardless of low it is."" 
The benchmark 10-year note (US10YT=RR) was most recently above 1% on March 20 and last week was near all-time closing lows. The 20-year bond slipped just below 1% on Thursday.
""These moves come as new data confirms a record economic decline in (the second quarter),"" Tradeweb said in a research note.
On Thursday, the U.S. Commerce Department said U.S. gross domestic product declined at a 32.9% annualized rate last quarter, slightly less than expected but still the deepest decline in output since the government started keeping records in 1947. 
Some analysts think that the Federal Reserve may shift more of its buying to the long end of the yield curve. That could put additional downward pressure on yields, Tradeweb said. 
Falling below 1% across the whole curve would ""be a sign of the times,"" after central banks ""opened the monetary spigot, pressuring yields lower,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities, and would aid the economic recovery. 
Still, he said a counterbalance to downward pressure on yields could be the expected upcoming stimulus and the Treasury's refunding announcement.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department is due to release its quarterly refunding statement. At the last refunding, in May, it launched the long-planned 20 year bond. One question is whether the Treasury will continue to aggressively issue 30-year bonds as it did this spring, NatWest Markets wrote in a July 29 research note.
While the 30-year is not near record lows, it has fallen steadily from a recent peak of 1.48% on July 6. Only once before has the longest-term U.S. Treasury bond yielded less than 1%, during dramatic trading on March 9 as the extent of the public health crisis in the United States became clear - which meant that yields across the curve were then briefly sub 1%.
Bonds at the long end of the curve are sensitive to inflation risk, as higher prices erode purchasing power and returns. Current inflation stands well below the 2 percent target rate, said Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday, with the pandemic crushing demand. ""I think fundamentally this is a disinflationary shock,"" he said.
Real yields, which adjust for inflation, have also been hitting record lows, with the yield on 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) (US10YTIP=RR) now more than negative 1%.
A yield curve entirely under 1% would likely reinforce many of the trends that have taken hold in the low-yield era of the last several years.
Low yields tend to pressure banks’ earnings by cutting into returns on both bond investments and fixed-rate loans. They also make the U.S. dollar - which recently hit its lowest level in more than two years against a basket of other currencies - less attractive to yield-seeking investors.
At the same time, low yields raise the allure of equities, in part by sending income-thirsty investors searching for higher yielding to equities. More broadly, they help companies by making it cheaper for them to borrow.

The slide in real yields reflects ""ultra-easy monetary policy expectations and deteriorating macro conditions,"" said analysts at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) in a recent note. Inflows into inflation protected bonds could mean some investors are pricing the risk of stagflation, said the bank.

1450,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>",U.S. ISM Manufacturing Expands at Fastest Pace Since March 2019,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. manufacturing expanded in July at the fastest pace since March 2019 as more factories boosted production in the face of firmer orders and lean inventories.
The Institute for Supply Management said Monday that its manufacturing gauge increased to 54.2 last month from 52.6. Readings above 50 indicate expansion, and the latest figure exceeded the 53.6 median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
The data point to a steadier environment for producers, months after demand plummeted during the pandemic-related lockdown of the economy. Nonetheless, the pace of improvement risks moderating as the coronavirus stands in the way of a sustained quickening of demand.
Because the ISM’s report is based on a survey of purchasing managers and asks whether activity is increasing, decreasing or stagnant, the figures can be prone to big swings during turning points in the economy. The industry still faces a myriad of challenges that include high unemployment nationwide, a recent pickup in coronavirus cases, cutbacks in business investment and tenuous global demand.
The ISM’s measure of production increased in July to 62.1, the highest level since August 2018, and a gauge of orders climbed to 61.5, which was the strongest since September of that year. Output is strengthening because virus-induced shutdowns of factories, including the nation’s automakers, forced retailers and other end-users to rely on inventory to meet demand.
The group’s index of customer inventories fell to 41.6 in July, the lowest this year and showing that stockpiles were shrinking at a faster pace. Factory inventories also declined after barely growing a month earlier.
The improvements in orders and output still aren’t generating much hiring, however, as manufacturers remain cautious about the sustainability of demand. While in line with its pre-pandemic level, the ISM’s factory employment gauge still shows payrolls are declining, albeit at a slower pace.

That compares with -6.5% a month ago, and while it would still comfortably represent the steepest annual downturn on record, it is the most optimistic outlook since May.
Central bank President Roberto Campos Neto said last month that the bank's own -6.4% GDP call for this year is too pessimistic, and Economy Ministry officials are confident the contraction will be closer to the government's -4.7% forecast.
The central bank's latest weekly 'FOCUS' survey of around 100 economists also showed 2020 current account deficit projections narrowing for a sixth consecutive week, to $6.2 billion from $8.3 billion. The average forecast in May was for a deficit of almost $40 billion.
Economists maintained their year-end interest rate outlook at 2.00% for the fifth week in a row, the survey showed. The central bank is expected to lower its benchmark Selic rate by 25 basis points to a new low of 2.00% later this week.

The inflation outlook for this year fell slightly to 1.6% from 1.7%. That is well below the central bank's goal of 4.00%, and also well below the 2.5% lower band of the bank's target range.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has taken eight insurers to court over business interruption policy wordings, which the insurers say do not cover the pandemic, with a ruling expected in mid-September.
But the case does not address how any resulting claims payments would be calculated, the FCA said on Monday. 
""We may intervene and take further actions where firms do not appear to be meeting our expectations and treating their customers fairly,"" the FCA said in a statement.
Some insurers were making deductions for government loans - which businesses had received as a result of the pandemic - when calculating payouts. 
The FCA said this could be appropriate but insurers should not take a one-size-fits-all approach and make uniform deductions.
""Insurers are likely to need to consider individually the precise details of the policy, the claim and the use and application of the government support the policyholder received,"" the FCA said.
Similar wordings to those in the test case were used by more than 60 insurers and could affect 370,000 policyholders, the FCA has said. 
Insurers are already paying claims on some business interruption policies. The Association of British Insurers said its members expected to pay 900 million pounds in such claims this year due to the pandemic.

Analysts said a win for the FCA could take the size of those payments to billions of pounds.

Employees were told that teleworking will stay the default option, the people said, asking not to be named as internal communications are confidential.
A spokesman for the central bank declined to comment on the timeline, but said that “having had positive experiences with remote working, the ECB will err on the cautious side when deciding on a return to office-based working. The current regime is that those who have good reasons to work from the office, can do so.”
Attempts by companies across the globe to judge when they can bring back workers are being frustrated by an upturn in new coronavirus cases that threatens to further damage the economy. The pandemic is now adding a million infections every four days, and governments in some parts of the world have reimposed lockdowns.
Multiple members of the 19-nation euro zone have also seen an increase, including Germany, the home of the Frankfurt-based ECB.

FRANKFURT/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - - While millions of U.S. workers thrown into unemployment by the coronavirus pandemic fret about feeding their families, idled German airline purser Marco Todte is mainly concerned about his next vacation.
Todte, 41, hasn't flown for work since April. But Germany's state-subsidized ""Kurzarbeit"" furlough scheme and a top-up from employer Lufthansa means he is getting 90% of his regular income and has the cash to explore what few leisure options there are in an economy still emerging from lockdown.
""It is hard to go to the cinema or to go out in the evenings. I had planned on a cruise but that was cancelled,"" Todte complained. ""It’s not a question of money - more a question of what there is to do with it.""
That's a problem that Juan Ruiz, a 56-year-old billing agent who lost his job at a Los Angeles forklift company in March when he contracted COVID-19, would love to have.
The failure of Congress to agree on replacing the $600-a-week extra unemployment benefit before its expiry on Friday means his family's finances are now in jeopardy.
Ruiz used his first benefit cheques to pay down his debts but still has a mortgage to cover and says the new proposal of just $200-a-week on the table when talks resume on Monday is nowhere near enough.
""We have a lot of bills, we need to pay the house, taxes, everything,"" Ruiz, still struggling with his breathing as a result of the disease, told Reuters at his home. 
""We desperately need that help.""
Nothing illustrates the contrasting economic responses of the United States and Europe to the pandemic more clearly than how they are dealing with the devastation it has brought to their jobs markets.
The extra U.S. weekly benefit was an attempt to cushion the short-term blow to households as over 30 million people became jobless. It is based on the assumption that they will be able to return to the workforce as soon as the economy recovers.
The European approach, building on schemes like ""Kurzarbeit"" already in existence, has been to use costly state subsidies to keep workers on company payrolls with wages near regular levels even when they work part-time or not at all.
At the most generous end of the spectrum, the Dutch ""NOW"" programme retains workers on 100% of their income even when they work zero hours. For those laid off, the baseline Dutch dole programme is worth around $1,000 a month.
WHEN TO WIND DOWN?
Advocates of furloughs argue that, by maintaining the link between worker and employer, they make it easier for a company to ramp up activity quickly when demand returns. 
Critics say they keep many non-viable jobs alive when it would be better for them to be replaced by new positions in healthier sectors.
The recent resurgence of new coronavirus cases in the United States and Europe has raised fresh questions about the timing of any recovery and how long either approach can be maintained. 
But for now, it is clear the European way is alleviating more pain.
By the end of May, an estimated 45 million workers in Britain and the four largest euro zone economies - Germany, France, Italy and Spain - were registered in furlough schemes. For the euro zone, that has kept the jobless rate at just under 8%, barely a point higher than its pre-lockdown level.
That approach has been lauded by the European Central Bank (ECB) for supporting consumer morale and buffering household income, seen by many economists as key to the recovery.
Data on Friday showed French consumer spending for example shot back to its pre-pandemic level in June even as the overall economy shrank by 13.8% in the second quarter. Consumer morale in Germany is also strong.
""(The system) stabilizes the income of households so that they still consume,"" said Sebastian Link, labour expert at the Ifo economic institute, which estimates some 42% of German firms still had workers on Kurzarbeit in July.
June data show consumer spending in the United States has held up but households have had to bite into savings as income levels have fallen. The wealth squeeze will only get worse if the expiring jobless benefit is not replaced.
While the immediate challenge for U.S. policymakers is to come up with new support to ensure millions are not thrown into poverty, European governments face hard questions about how long they can sustain their furloughs.
Britain is planning from October to wind down its scheme, which has supported 9.5 million jobs at a cost of $41 billion so far, despite predictions that would cause unemployment to more than double to 10% by year-end.
Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, said he expected other job subsidy schemes across Europe to be removed gradually, with the timing dependent on a recovery which in turn could be threatened by future spikes in infections.
""A lot of it was predicated on this being short-term. If the recovery process is slower then it becomes tricky,"" he said.

1457,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday, August 3rd","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com -- TikTok has become the latest flashpoint between the Chinese and U.S. governments as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) circles, while Wall Street is set for a quiet start as the earnings season continues. Investors will be looking at Washington for more news about another relief package as the coronavirus enters a new phase. Economic data centers around the ISM manufacturing release Monday, ahead of Friday’s key employment report. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, August 3rd.
1. TikTok on the block
Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok has become the latest flashpoint in the deteriorating relationship between the globe’s two economic superpowers, the U.S. and China.
However, Microsoft could have the answer to this particular problem after the U.S. tech giant confirmed that it is holding talks with the app’s owner Bytedance over purchasing the app’s U.S. operations.
Microsoft boss Satya Nadella had a conversation with President Donald Trump about the acquisition on Sunday, the tech firm said, and Reuters reported Monday the president has now allowed Microsoft 45 days to negotiate a deal.
A successful bid by Microsoft for the popular app would immediately make it a major competitor to social media giants like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Snapchat.
Trump had previously vowed to ban the app, with the U.S. administration stating that it poses a national security risk because of the personal data it handles. This follows the hard-line stance the U.S. has taken over Chinese companies that it feels contain critical technology.
Short-form video app TikTok is thought to have about half a billion active users worldwide - and about 80 million in the U.S. - with a huge proportion of these in their teens or early 20s.
Banning the app could alienate many of these young TikTok users ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November, an election which is likely to be tightly fought.
2. Coronavirus “extraordinarily widespread” in U.S. - Birx
Coronavirus cases continued to surge in parts of the U.S., with July being the worst month for new cases since the pandemic began. Additionally, White House coronavirus experts warned Sunday that the country is in a new phase of the outbreak.
""We are in a new phase,"" said Dr. Deborah Birx. ""What we are seeing today is different from March and April. It is extraordinarily widespread"" in rural as well as urban areas.
""To everybody who lives in a rural area: You are not immune or protected from this virus,"" Birx said. 
The virus has already claimed over 150,000 lives in the U.S., by far the highest death toll in the world, plus more than a half-million others around the globe.
With this in mind, investors will be keeping their eyes on Washington where Congress is still deadlocked over the next round of economic relief from the pandemic.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said on Sunday he was not optimistic on reaching agreement soon on a deal for the next round of legislation. 
On Friday tens of millions of Americans lost a $600 per week federal unemployment supplement.
3. Positive corporate earnings helping U.S. stock markets
U.S. stock markets are seen largely unchanged Monday, with the Nasdaq index set to outperform on the back of strong earnings from the tech giants last week. News out of Washington (see above) and the ongoing earnings season will be key factors this week, ahead of Friday’s official employment report.
By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 20 points or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was up 0.3% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was 0.7% higher.
These cash indexes had a strong July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.4%, the S&P 500 5.5%, its best July in 10 years, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 6.8%.
The week ahead brings another packed slate of earnings, with 130 members of the S&P 500 set to report. Monday sees  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) and Clorox (NYSE:CLX) report before the opening bell, and Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) after the close.
“To date, 63% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported actual results for Q2 2020,” said John Butters at Factset, in a note to clients. “In terms of earnings, the percentage of companies reporting actual EPS above estimates (84%) is above the five-year average. If 84% is the final percentage for the quarter, it will mark the highest percentage of S&P 500 companies reporting a positive EPS surprise since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2008.”
4. ISM manufacturing index set to show growth
The jobs report on Friday will be the key economic release this week, but ahead of that comes the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index, due at 10 AM ET (14:00 GMT). 
This is expected to show a small rebound to 53.6 in July, from 52.6 the previous month, suggesting this part of the economy remains in expansion territory, although the containment measures which were reintroduced in some states in the second half of the month could create a negative surprise.
Earlier Monday, manufacturing activity across the euro zone expanded for the first time since early 2019, with IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index bouncing to 51.8 in July from June's 47.4.
The news was also positive in Asia, as China’s private Caixin manufacturing PMI increased to 52.8 from 51.2 the prior month, its highest level since January 2011.
On Friday, China’s official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose in July to 51.1 from 50.9 a month earlier, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. 
5. Weak dollar helps gold, Treasurys higher
The U.S.dollar had a bad July, suffering its largest monthly fall in three years. 
Traders have been fretting about the explosion of coronavirus cases across America, amid fears an ineffectual response could result in lasting damage to the U.S. economy that could keep interest rates and growth low for years.
“This is not the benign dollar decline we had envisaged, but instead, one seemingly being driven on a new risk premium being inserted into U.S. asset markets on the back of a resurgence in US Covid-19 cases,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
This has resulted in a soaring price for gold, which moved up more than 9% in the month of July to all-time highs. The yellow metal is denominated in dollars and thus cheaper for investors outside of the U.S., as well as being seen as a store of value during geopolitical uncertainty.
U.S. Treasurys have also been in demand, with five-year Treasury yields falling to a record after the Federal Reserve last week delivered a dovish message of support for the coronavirus-stricken U.S. economy.

1460,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 04:56AM ET</span>",Japan retailer Nojima bets on longevity as population shrinks,"By Kiyoshi Takenaka
FUJISAWA, Japan (Reuters) - At Japanese electronics retailer Nojima's (T:7419) sales outlet in Fujisawa, south of Tokyo, Tadashi Sato, 72, is defining a work culture that could soon become commonplace in a country with a fast-ageing and shrinking population.
""I think it's wonderful,"" Sato said when asked about the new policy at Nojima, which in a rare move for a major Japanese company, made it an official policy last month to let its workers stay until they turn 80.
Sato is constantly on the move, attending to customers, restocking shelves and having quick huddles with colleagues often in their 20s and 30s.
""I used to imagine a 72-year-old as an ancient person. But I now feel like I'm in my fifties, and I'm working hard so as not to fall behind young people.""
Under the scheme, Nojima's 3,000 regular employees can stay on the job until 80 on a renewable annual contract once they have hit the company's retirement age of 65 - setting the stage for more store clerks of Sato's age at Japan's sixth-largest home appliances chain operator.
Japan is the world's most advanced ageing society, with people who are 65 or older accounting for 28 percent of the population, compared with second-ranked Italy's 23 percent, according to United Nations data. 
Yoshiyuki Tanaka, Nojima's executive director, said it is only natural to seek ways to utilise senior workers as Japan's labour force contracts, and sees the new policy as beneficial to its customers as well. 
""We have many elderly customers visiting our shops. There are young people on the staff. But being waited on courteously by someone of similar age must be good for them,"" Tanaka said. 
Sato, who had worked on refrigerator manufacturing for 30 years before joining Nojima in his mid-50s, echoes Tanaka's sentiment.
""Hundreds of people are involved in manufacturing a single refrigerator. And those of us at retail shops are engaged in the very last stage of that process,"" Sato said.

""To me, a customer is like someone to whom I am marrying my daughter off.""

1461,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 04:20AM ET</span>",Explainer: How the next WTO chief will be chosen and the task ahead,"GENEVA/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Eight candidates from Mexico to Moldova are bidding to become the next director-general of the World Trade Organization to replace Roberto Azevedo, who steps down at the end of August.
CHALLENGES
The next chief would broker international trade talks in the face of widening U.S.-China conflict, protectionism increased by the COVID-19 pandemic and pressure to reform trade rules.
U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" policies have upended the global trading order and presented an existential threat to the WTO. Trump has called the institution ""broken"" and ""horrible"". Washington has blocked appointments to the WTO's Appellate Body that settles trade disputes, which now no longer has the minimum number of judges to convene. 
HOW THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL IS CHOSEN
The candidates have been given two months to campaign until September 7. Normally this would involve trips to national capitals, but with the pandemic much of that is being done in a virtual format.
The next phase involves whittling down the field, initially to five then two, before a final decision is taken.
The WTO is a members-driven organisation with decisions reached by consensus among 164 countries. Three WTO ambassadors who chair leading committees will lead the process, seeking to establish which candidates have the widest support.
In so-called ""confessionals"", members will tell this ""troika"" their preferences, without ranking them and without vetoes in a process expected to last two months. The first phase will be on Sept 7-16. Voting on the next director-general is seen only as a last resort if consensus cannot be reached.
The process does not always work smoothly. In 1999, former New Zealand prime minister Mike Moore and Thailand's Supachai Panitchpakdi divided WTO members, with a compromise finally found to give each a term, shortened to three years from four.
Azevedo's term will finish before his replacement takes office, but WTO members failed to agree on a temporary caretaker director-general, meaning the four deputies will stay on in their current roles.
MORE SOFT THAN HARD POWER
The Marrakesh Agreement that established the WTO in 1995 does not give a detailed description of the director-general role. The responsibilities should be ""exclusively international in character"".
The incoming chief would be expected to appoint four new deputies, present budget proposals, and chair the trade negotiations committee which oversees multilateral accords such as on fishing subsidies. 
The director-general can also intervene in trade disputes, in very rare cases offering mediation, more often by appointing people to adjudicating panels when parties cannot agree.

Otherwise, the director-general does not forge global trade policy, but is meant to act as a neutral broker: part administrator, part peacemaker.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's central bank is widely expected to leave its key interest rate unchanged at a record low after three cuts this year to help cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, a Reuters poll showed.
In the poll, 16 of 18 economists predicted the Bank of Thailand's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) would hold its one-day repurchase rate  at 0.50% for a second straight meeting.
The other two economists saw a 25 basis-point cut to a fresh record low of 0.25%, citing economic shrinkage, falling consumer prices and a stubbornly strong baht .
Most analysts think policymakers may want to save some ammunition while assessing risks and the effects of earlier support measures. 
""There are fixes needed with previous measures that have been rolled out, such as the drawdown in soft loans,"" said Kobsidthi Silpachai, head of capital market research at Kasikornbank. ""It is the distribution of low rates that need to be addressed"".
Economic activity has picked up in recent weeks as a result of the government’s largely successful containment of COVID-19 so far, meaning there are ""no pressing reasons for the BOT to use up its remaining ammunition,"" HSBC said in a note.
The BOT has forecast Southeast Asia's second-largest economy will shrink by a record 8.1% this year but recently said there had been some improvement after the lockdown was eased.
Economist Takit Chardcherdsak at Asia Plus Securities said the MPC might ease policy in the fourth quarter because of ""unknown factors"".
Some analysts said the BOT is unlikely to take action before new governor Sethaput Suthiwart-Narueput, an MPC member and economic advisor to the prime minister, takes office in October.
However, economist Tim Leelahaphan at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank forecast a quarter-point cut this week ""amid a persistent economic contraction, negative inflation, a strong Thai baht and rising household debt"".

1464,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 02:40AM ET</span>",India's central bank likely to cut rates despite inflation risk,"By Swati Bhat
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's worsening economic outlook as coronavirus cases soar has raised the chance the central bank will cut interest rates at its policy review on Thursday, in spite of inflationary pressures.
Around two-thirds of economists in a Reuters poll expect the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut the repo rate  by another 25 basis points (bps) on Aug. 6 to a record low of 3.50%, and once more next quarter.
""High inflation has added confusion to the Reserve Bank's policy outlook, but given the state of aggregate demand, we forecast the RBI will continue easing,"" said Rahul Bajoria, economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) who expects a 25-bp cut.
Annual retail inflation  rose in June to 6.09% from 5.84% in March, remaining above the RBI's medium-term target range of 2%-6%.
The RBI's recent policies have focused on financial stability and the need to support growth despite the price target.
The country was placed under one of the strictest lockdowns in the world in late March for over two months to halt the spread of the coronavirus. The government gradually eased restrictions in June although infections continue to rise. 
The poll showed most analysts expect the economy to contract 20% in the June quarter versus the April forecast of a 5.2% fall and remain in negative terrain until the December quarter. 
For the full year 2020/21, the economy is likely to shrink 5.1%, which would be its weakest performance since 1979, a sharp contrast to the 1.5% expansion forecast in April.
Apart from rate cuts, Upasna Bharadwaj, economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank, expects liquidity and regulatory measures from the RBI to address demand shocks and financial market dislocations.
""RBI may look to widen the policy corridor to 75 bps by easing reverse repo by a higher quantum,"" she said, adding that though they expect a 25-bp rate cut, it may not be effective in the current environment.
The RBI has already reduced the repo rate by a total of 115 basis points since February, on top of the 135 basis points in an easing cycle last year, from 6.50%, responding to slowing growth.
Some economists, however, feel it may be prudent for the RBI to pause in August before resuming its rate-cutting cycle once inflation has stabilised.
Weakness in growth versus above-target inflation, improving indicators and concerns over inflation expectations will put the RBI in a tough spot, said DBS economist Radhika Rao. 

""It will be a close call, but we see slightly higher odds for a pause.""

1465,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>",Lockdown savings push UK millennials into stock markets,"By Sinead Cruise and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON, August 3 (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a spike in investment among Britons, with millennials leading the way as they turn increasingly to the stock market. 
The crisis pushed UK household consumption down by a record 9.5 billion pounds ($12.5 billion) in the first quarter as spending on restaurants, clothes and cars plummeted, official data shows. 
That drop in spending has led to a pick-up in equities investment by people frustrated at low savings rates, particularly among so-called millennials born after 1981, 
Investment platform Interactive Investor said that openings of tax-efficient self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs) and ISA investment accounts by 25 to 34 year olds jumped more than 250% year on year in the second quarter as low rates on regular savings products boosted the appeal of alternatives offering potentially greater returns.
A survey from fund tracker Calastone found that 69% of British millennials with investment portfolios have added to them in the past month or plan to do so in the next month.
That's the biggest proportion among the four age groups categorised by Calastone, with only 29% of the 1950s-born ""older baby boomers"" chalking up new investments in the past month or making plans to do so in the next month.
Tom Butterworth, a 25-year-old account manager from London, is among the growing cohort of millennials trying stocks for the first time, joining a broader trend of increased retail investment in stock markets.
'GOOD TIME TO BUY'
""I can see that during this crash is a good time to buy due to prices being so low ... I have only just come into a position where I feel comfortable investing a small amount each month,"" he said. 
Butterworth plans to invest about 200 pounds a month, mainly in funds tracking the UK stock market.
More than a quarter of millennials born between 1981 and 1996 said the market crashes in the first four months of 2020 were tempting them to invest, a poll by personal finance comparison site Finder.com found. That compared with only one in 10 among those born before World War Two.
The engagement with equities investment by millennials is all the more striking given the financial uncertainty many face, particularly those placed on furlough or on zero-hours contracts and juggling student debt.
Sam Gilmore, a 25-year-old teacher from Salford in northwest England, started investing in January, putting 100 pounds a month in a range of index-tracker funds. 
The sharp markets crash in March quickly depleted his early gains but he plans to continue.
""I'm going to stick to my guns and keep investing a consistent amount,"" Gilmore said, adding that he would only invest what he could afford to lose and that, as a young investor with time on his side, he could ride out the downturn.

The government and Congress failed to resolve differences over where the money would be spent by the time a deadline to approve the loan expired on Friday night, raising doubts about whether the Central American country would receive it.
However, Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya and Mario Ponce, the head of Congress, asked the IDB for an extension in order to be able to ratify the loan in a special session on Sunday.
This time a deal was reached, and Congress authorized the loan with the backing of 59 out of 84 lawmakers in the chamber.
According to the government, the IDB offered El Salvador the loan at an interest rate of 2.1% with a 5-1/2 year grace period, giving the country until the end of July to approve it.

1467,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2020 05:27PM ET</span>",Australia Braces for Economic Hit as Melbourne Put Under Curfew,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the economy faces another significant hit after Victoria extended a lockdown across the whole state and placed its capital Melbourne under a nighttime curfew.
Frydenberg said Treasury was still working through the expected impact and a lot depended on further announcements expected this week on what industries and businesses would be allowed to stay open under the new restrictions. “This is a massive kick in the guts to Victorian businesses,” he told Sky News Monday.
Victoria’s government on Sunday declared a state of disaster after the outbreak showed no signs of abating three weeks after Melbourne’s 5 million residents were ordered to stay home except for work, medical care, provisions or exercise. The lockdown will now cover all of Australia’s second-most populous state, and residents of the city will be under curfew between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m. The new restrictions will be in force for six weeks.
Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews announced the new measures as the state reported another 671 new cases and seven deaths. More than 380 people were hospitalized, with 38 in intensive care.
“We need to come down on this hard,” Andrews said. The number of mystery cases that couldn’t be traced to a known outbreak had risen to an “unacceptably high” level that could not be continued, he added.
Schools across the state will move to remote learning from Wednesday, while childcare centers in Melbourne will close to all but essential workers from Thursday.
The tighter restrictions threaten to exacerbate Australia’s first recession in almost 30 years. Victoria contributes about one-quarter of gross domestic product, but is now isolated from the rest of the country as other states shutter their borders against the worrying spike in community transmission.
Treasury had previously estimated a six-week Melbourne lockdown would cost the economy A$3.3 billion ($2.4 billion) in the September quarter.
“Clearly the impact on the Victorian economy which makes up a quarter of the national economy will be very significant,” Frydenberg said Monday. “That number will be higher.”
Separately, New South Wales - the nation’s most populous state - recorded another 12 cases Sunday with Premier Gladys Berejiklian “strongly encouraging” residents to wear masks in certain situations, such as supermarkets and places of worship.
“I want to stress it’s not compulsory, but it is a strong recommendation,” Berejiklian told reporters. “I can’t stress enough how critical the next few weeks are,” adding she was taking extra measures due to the state’s geographical proximity to Victoria.
Second Lockdown
Australia’s first lockdown that lasted roughly from March to May was one of the most successful in the world, bringing down cases to just a handful a day nationwide. But security failures at quarantine hotels for returning travelers and poor communication of critical information to migrant communities allowed the virus to roar back in Victoria.
With those unable to work from home not willing to sacrifice wages, and people losing patience with physical isolation, many no longer seem willing to fully follow the rules as the economic and social costs mount.
The Australian dollar was priced 0.2% lower against the greenback at 0.7131, as at 7:18am Sydney time. The spot price closed lower in New York on Friday to snap a five-day winning streak.

1468,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2020 04:35PM ET</span>",Fed's Kashkari suggests 4-6 week shutdown; says U.S. Congress can spend big on coronavirus relief,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy could benefit if the nation were to ""lock down really hard"" for four to six weeks, a top Federal Reserve official said on Sunday, adding that Congress can well afford large sums for coronavirus relief efforts. 
The economy, which in the second quarter suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression, would be able to mount a robust recovery, but only if the virus were brought under control, Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, told CBS' ""Face the Nation.""
""If we don't do that and we just have this raging virus spreading throughout the country with flare-ups and local lockdowns for the next year or two, which is entirely possible, we're going to see many, many more business bankruptcies,"" Kashkari said.
""That's going to be a much slower recovery for all of us.""
He said Congress is positioned to spend big on coronavirus relief efforts because the nation's budget gap can be financed without relying on foreign borrowing, given how much Americans are saving.
""Those of us who are fortunate enough to still have our jobs, we're saving a lot more money because we're not going to restaurants or movie theaters or vacations,"" Kashkari said.
""That actually means that we have a lot more resources as a country to support those who have been laid off,"" he said.
The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives approved a $3 trillion relief bill in May, while Senate Republicans, many of whom have expressed concerns about mounting debt, countered by proposing a $1 trillion aid package last week.
Efforts to craft a compromise appear stalled. 
In an interview with ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said President Donald Trump would spend what was needed, but that the deficit was a factor.
""There's obviously a need to support workers and support the economy,"" he said. ""On the other hand, we have to be careful about not piling on enormous amount of debts for future generations.""
Kashkari took a different view, stressing both the high level of domestic saving and historically low interest rates.
""I'm not worried about it,"" he said. ""Congress should use this opportunity to support the American people and the American economy.""
""If we get the economy growing, we will be able to pay off the debt,"" Kashkari added.

1470,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2020 03:25PM ET</span>",Genoa's new bridge puts spotlight on how Italy can manage recovery,"By Francesca Landini and James Mackenzie
MILAN (Reuters) - Just two years after part of Genoa's Morandi bridge collapsed killing 43 people, a new structure opens in its place on Monday, an achievement in stark contrast to stalled infrastructure projects elsewhere in Italy.
The new kilometre-long bridge, designed by star architect Renzo Piano, replaces the old motorway viaduct which broke apart in the port city on Aug. 14, 2018 in one of Italy's worst civil disasters in decades.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who will attend the inauguration of the new Genova-San Giorgio viaduct said it would be a ""symbol of a new Italy rising up again.""
The accident laid bare years of mismanagement and poor maintenance and set off an acrimonious battle between the government and Atlantia's Autostrade per l'Italia, the private concession holder controlled by the powerful Benetton family that ran the bridge.
Several former and current executives of Autostrade and transport ministry officials have been placed under investigation by prosecutors and, after months of wrangling, Atlantia is set to lose control of its lucrative subsidiary.
For the mayor of Genoa and state-appointed commissioner for bridge reconstruction, Marco Bucci, the case is both an example of decades-long failures in Italy's transport infrastructure and a demonstration of what the country is capable of accomplishing. ""There's a feeling of both regret for what happened and pride in the work that's been done,"" he told Reuters. ""We've worked and shown Italian excellence."" For years, Italy's economy has suffocated under a mix of poor governance made worse by corruption and a thicket of vested interests and bureaucracy that have stifled innovation and fostered the kind of neglect that led to the bridge disaster. Genoa itself, surrounded by rugged hills that constrain road transport, has seen a motorway bypass project held up for decades. With the coronavirus crisis still unfolding and billions of euros set to come to Italy from Europe's newly agreed recovery fund, addressing such failures has gained a new urgency. As well as the shocking human toll, the collapse of the Morandi bridge dealt a severe economic blow to Genoa, costing the city an estimated 6 million euros ($7.06 million) a day in lost revenues and additional costs, Bucci said, with freight traffic interrupted for months.
Under heavy pressure to address the neglect which caused the disaster, the government pushed through an emergency decree to sweep aside red tape. Between demolishing the remainder of the old structure in Feb. 2019 to opening the new bridge 18 months later, the speed of the project has been breakneck in a country with crumbling roads and tunnels and development plans gathering dust. While the circumstances behind the bridge collapse were unique, a lot rides on repeating that momentum elsewhere. 
Trust and clear project goals - two things that have often been lacking in big infrastructure projects - were vital, said Roberto Carpaneto, head of RINA Consulting, who worked with the construction consortium led by Italian infrastructure groups Webuild (MI:WBD) and Fincantieri.

""Being able to say what was going to happen, when and why allowed us to build this relation of trust,"" he said.

1471,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 02, 2020 12:54PM ET</span>","Fed’s Kashkari Urges Congress to Act, Suggests Fresh Lockdown","(Bloomberg) -- The surging U.S. savings rate means the country can afford to support Americans laid off due to the coronavirus pandemic, while a “hard” lockdown could deliver a faster economic recovery, a senior Federal Reserve official said on Sunday.
Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari told CBS’s “Face the Nation” that Americans are saving more because they aren’t going out as much during the pandemic, and as a result there would be less need to borrow from abroad to finance additional fiscal aid.
“So while historically we would worry about racking up too much debt, we’re generating the savings ourselves. That means Congress has the resources to support those who are most hurting,” he said.
“Right now the U.S. can fund itself at very, very low rates. Congress should use this opportunity to support the American people and the American economy.”
Kashkari is a voter this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
Running Out
U.S. lawmakers and the Trump administration are wrangling after enhanced unemployment aid for as many as 30 million jobless Americans expired. Democrats and Republicans are looking for common ground on the jobless benefits and other help for an economy sagging under the weight of pandemic-induced shutdowns.
Fed officials, after cutting interest rates aggressively, have repeatedly pointed out the need for more support from the fiscal side to help the nation endure the pandemic. The U.S. central bank last week left interest rates near zero and pledged to use all its tools to support the economy, which shrank at a record pace in the second quarter as the virus spread.
Hopes of a speedy rebound have been dimmed as high-frequency economic indicators suggest a stall in activity given rising or persistently high infection rates in certain parts of the country.
Kashkari said that the path of the economy would hinge on success in getting the pandemic under control, and suggested that while very unpopular, a stringent economic lockdown might be the lesser of two evils to more quickly restore growth and hiring, rather than waiting for the eventual arrival of a vaccine.
“If we were to lock down hard for a month or six weeks, we could get the case count down so that our testing and our contact tracing was actually enough to control it,” Kashkari said.
“If we don’t do that, and we just have this raging virus spread throughout the country with flare-ups and local lockdowns for the next year or two, which is entirely possible, we’re going to see many, many more business bankruptcies.”

1472,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2020 11:55AM ET</span>",Argentina creditors seek global support for bond clause changes,"By Rodrigo Campos and Tom Arnold
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - A group of Argentina's creditors has contacted the Institute of International Finance and other global bodies for support to amend legal clauses in its sovereign bond restructuring, a spokesman for the organisation said.
Buenos Aires is trying to clinch a deal to restructure around $65 billion in foreign debt by Tuesday, though it is likely to push that deadline back after bondholders grouped behind a counter-proposal, causing an impasse in talks.
Specific details of what creditors are seeking the support of the organisations on was unclear.
But collective action clauses (CACs), which determine the requirements for any future changes made to the bond agreements, are a key issue in the negotiations.
The bondholders, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Ashmore and Fidelity Management and Research, also made informal contact with the International Monetary Fund, U.S. Treasury and the International Capital Market Association, a creditor source told Reuters.
The IMF, U.S. Treasury and ICMA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Although these organisations have no control over how bond contracts are structured, the creditors hope that their support would help to persuade Argentina's Economy Minister Martin Guzman to agree to changes they want.
Guzman said on Thursday that the government's proposal was the maximum effort it could make, but that there was the ""possibility for innovations"" with legal clauses, but only with international backing.
""That's not a matter for Argentina and a subset of creditors to decide,"" he said during an online conference.
Argentina is pushing for enhanced CACs, which allow borrowers to bundle together multiple bonds, making it even harder for minority hold-outs pushing for a better deal to disrupt the process. Enhanced CACs require a single threshold for approval, generally set at 75%.
Creditors are worried the government will use the CACs to adopt the ""Pac-Man"" strategy of attempting to get them on board one at a time.
News of the bondholders' contact efforts was first reported by Bloomberg.

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",White House says not optimistic on near-term deal for coronavirus relief bill,"By Doina Chiacu and Tim Ahmann
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said on Sunday he was not optimistic on reaching agreement soon on a deal for the next round of legislation to provide relief to Americans hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.
""I'm not optimistic that there will be a solution in the very near term,"" Meadows said on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" as staff members from both sides were meeting to try to iron out differences over the bill.
Democrats were standing in the way of a separate agreement to extend some federal unemployment benefits in the short-term while negotiations continue on an overall relief package, he said. 
""We continue to see really a stonewalling of any piecemeal type of legislation that happens on Capitol Hill,"" Meadows said. ""Hopefully that will change in the coming days."" 
Lawmakers and the White House have been unable to reach an accord for a next round of economic relief from a pandemic that has killed more than 150,000 Americans and triggered the sharpest economic collapse since the Great Depression.
Both sides said on Saturday they had their most positive talks yet. But there was no sign of movement on the biggest sticking point - $600 per week in extra federal unemployment benefits for Americans that has been a lifeline for millions of jobless Americans and expired on Friday.
Asked about efforts to renew the expired emergency federal jobless benefits, Pelosi said, referring to Trump: ""He's the one standing in the way of that.""
Pelosi, who also highlighted the need for assistance for state and local governments, stood firm in her demand that Congress renew the $600 per week jobless aid. She told ABC's ""This Week"" that when unemployment drops, the federal support could fall too.
""As that goes down, then you can consider something less than the $600, but in this agreement it's $600,"" she said. ""It's essential for America's working families.""
The Trump administration and some Senate Republicans have been pushing for a reduction in those extra federal benefits, saying they should be tied to wages. Other Senate Republicans have rejected any extension. 
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told ABC Trump supports the enhanced benefits but does not want people to make more when they are unemployed than they would if they had a job.
""I think on the concept, we absolutely agree on enhanced unemployment. We want to fix the issue where in some cases people are overpaid and we want to make sure there's the right incentives,"" Mnuchin said. 
There is a need to support workers and the economy, he said, but ""we have to be careful about not piling on enormous amount of debts for future generation.""
The House of Representatives, controlled by Democrats, proposed their version of relief legislation in May. The Republican-led U.S. Senate did not make a counter-proposal until last week and even Republicans do not agree among themselves on what should be in the bill.
Mnuchin told reporters on Saturday the talks were constructive but had reached an ""impasse"" over whether to come to a short-term agreement to extend the federal jobless benefit or a more comprehensive deal.

The officials will meet again on Monday, after their staff meet on Sunday.

""President Trump has said 'enough' and we're going to fix it and so he will take action in the coming days with respect to a broad array of national security risks that are presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist Party,"" Pompeo said on Fox News Channel's ""Sunday Morning Futures.""
The news comes after Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One on Friday that he would issue an order for social media platform TikTok to be banned in the United States as early as Saturday.
Over the last several months, U.S. officials have repeatedly said TikTok under its current Chinese parent company, Beijing-based software firm ByteDance, poses a national risk because of the personal data it handles.
""They're true privacy issues for the American people and for a long time, a long time the United States just said 'well goodness if we're having fun with it, or if a company can make money off of it, we're going to permit that to happen,'"" Pompeo said. 
In response, under a recent proposal, ByteDance is willing to divest the U.S. operations of TikTok to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in a bid to make a deal with the White House, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Saturday. That offer has gained some support from allies of the president, including Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM).
In a separate interview on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews the national security implications of foreign business deals, is looking at the matter.

""I think the president has been spreading disinformation about the virus and she is his appointee so, I don't have confidence there, no,"" Speaker Pelosi told ABC's ""This Week"" when asked if she has confidence in Birx.
Birx, asked about Pelosi's comment during an interview with CNN's ""State of the Union,"" said she had great respect for Pelosi and attributed the criticism to a New York Times article on the White House pandemic response that described Birx as having embraced overly optimistic assessments on the virus.
""This was not a pollyannish view. I’ve never been called pollyannish, or non-scientific, or non-data driven,"" Birx said. ""I will stake my 40-year career on those fundamental principles of using data to implement better programs and save lives.""
Pelosi did not elaborate about Birx, a lead member of the coronavirus task force along with Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
According to a report in Politico, Pelosi attacked Birx's credibility during a meeting last week with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. She accused Birx of spreading disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, while praising Fauci as ""a hero,"" Politico said.

""Deborah Birx is the worst. Wow, what horrible hands you’re in,"" Pelosi told them, according to Politico.

1477,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 02, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>",Economic Calendar - Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,"By Noreen Burke
Investing.com -- Investors will be looking ahead to the U.S. jobs report for July, which is expected to shed more light on the strength of the economic rebound. Forecasts for the report fall into a broad range, but most analysts expect the bounce back in hiring to have slowed significantly last month. Markets will also be watching Congress, which remains deadlocked over the next round of economic relief after a critical lifeline for millions of unemployed Americans expired. It’s half-time for the second quarter earnings season after stunning results for Big Tech last week but faltering macroeconomic data and concerns over the course of the pandemic are weighing on Treasury yields. Meanwhile the Bank of England is expected to stay the course at its meeting on Thursday, with investors awaiting any hints on the possible future direction of monetary policy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
The Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls report for July, due on Friday is expected to show that 1.65 million jobs were added last month, slowing from 4.8 million in June. The report covers the period through mid-July, before containment measures were reintroduced in some states in the second half of the month.
Analysts at ING cautioned that while they expect to see an increase given employment was still rising in the second half of June and the first half of July, they are more cautious than the market and expect a figure closer to 750,000 versus the current consensus.
The jobs report will come a day after the weekly report on initial jobless claims. Last week’s figures showed a second straight weekly increase in initial jobless claims, together with the biggest increase in continuing claims since May, which could foreshadow a negative nonfarm payrolls number for August.
Investors will be keeping their eyes on Washington where Congress is still deadlocked over the next round of economic relief from a pandemic that has killed more than 150,000 Americans and triggered the sharpest economic collapse since the Great Depression.
On Friday tens of millions of Americans lost a $600 per week federal unemployment supplement after the White House and Congress failed to reach an agreement to extend the payments.
Congressional Democrats want to see the weekly payments extended into next year as part of a broader package, but Republicans have said the $600 payments are an incentive to stay home rather than return to work. Their proposal would provide a much lower weekly payment of $200 until states create a system to provide a 70% wage replacement for laid-off workers.
It’s halfway through second quarter earnings season and there have been more beats than misses so far. Of the approximately 250-plus companies that have so far released numbers in the U.S. and Europe 80% of S&P 500 companies beat estimates, versus 65% of European firms, Refinitiv IBES data shows.
While industrial names such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) delivered big positive surprises, the season also cemented U.S. tech's hegemony; Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported its biggest profit ever, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) smashed estimates and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone sales surpassed expectations.
Earnings may be less of a driver this week with most of the Big Tech names in the rear view mirror but there are still some big names reporting, including  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa),  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), Clorox (NYSE:CLX) and CVS (NYSE:CVS) to name just a few.
Data last Thursday showing that the U.S. economy contracted at a record 32.9% annualized rate in the second quarter, sent three, five-and 20-year yields to record lows. The entire yield curve is close to falling below 1%.
A fresh trigger for further falls could be July's unemployment figures.
Last week the Federal Reserve tied the economic recovery to resolution of the health crisis, saying ""the path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus"".
Fed policymakers repeated a pledge to use their ""full range of tools"" to support the economy and keep interest rates near zero for as long as it takes to recover from the epidemic.
The BoE will shed more light Thursday on how fast it expects the economy to rebound from the financial damage wrought by the pandemic, but is unlikely to add to the 100 billion pounds ($131 billion) of stimulus it announced in June.
Governor Andrew Bailey is likely to be asked about the BoE's latest thinking on negative interest rates -- it's among the central banks holding out against negative interest rates and analysts think it won't adjust its borrowing costs until end-2021.
The economic recovery looks likely to be prolonged and the UK still needs to reach a trade deal with the EU before the Brexit transition period ends on Dec. 31.
The BOE stance may be prudent. With the countdown towards the Brexit deadline well underway, policymakers may want to keep some options in reserve.

Britain has for decades failed to build enough housing to keep up with rising demand, driving house prices sharply higher. Among factors blamed for this situation are the time it takes to get planning permission and the slow pace of consultations.
""We are introducing a simpler, faster, people-focused system to deliver the homes and places we need,"" Jenrick said.
""Land designated for growth will empower development - new homes, hospitals, schools, shops and offices will be allowed automatically. People can get going.""

Drawing on the latest economic data, Lopez Obrador in a video address on YouTube estimated that remittances reached some $3.4 billion in June and $3.48 billion in July, up about 6.8% each from a year earlier.
Remittances stood at $3.38 billion in May, the second-highest for any month on record.
The vast bulk of Mexico's remittances are sent by millions of Mexicans living in the United States, and the president said he expected 2020 to be a record-breaking year for them.
Remittances have been a major support for the Mexican economy, which contracted more than 17% in the April-June period compared to the previous quarter.
Lopez Obrador reiterated that Mexico was bouncing back from the downturn even though the country is still posting record numbers of new daily coronavirus infections.
The economy would continue to improve during the third quarter before finally breaching ""the surface"" in a healthy state in the final three months of the year, Lopez Obrador said.

After major layoffs in the April-June period, the president said the economy had only shed 3,430 formal jobs in July. On top of that come millions of job losses in the informal economy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - British Trade Minister Liz Truss will meet top U.S. officials in Washington in coming days to assess progress on reaching a free trade agreement between the two countries, a spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said on Saturday. 
Truss is scheduled to meet U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Monday and Tuesday, his office said, confirming a Financial Times report. 
After leaving the European Union in January, Britain is keen to stand alone and has started a series of trade negotiations with other countries. A deal with the United States is seen as a priority.
Truss has previously said there was no timetable set for Britain's trade talks with the United States, adding that British negotiators had made ""very good progress"" despite conducting talks via video conference due to the coronavirus outbreak.
""We're not going to rush into a deal and there is no deadline. We will be tough in pressing our interests,"" Truss told a parliamentary committee in June.
The British embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday.
The FT reported late in July that the British government had abandoned hopes of clinching a free trade deal with the United States ahead of the American presidential election on Nov. 3, with officials blaming the pandemic for slow progress.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a visit to London last month that the United States and Britain still have more work to do on a free trade deal.

""A third round (of negotiations) scheduled for later this month, a primary focus for the United States is to see that we can make progress on this and bring this to a closure just as quickly as possible,"" Pompeo said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrats in Congress are not close to a deal with the White House to pump more money into the U.S. economy to ease the coronavirus' heavy toll, both sides said on Saturday, after an essential lifeline for millions of unemployed Americans expired.
""This was the longest meeting we had and it was more productive than the other meetings,"" Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. ""There are many issues that are still very much outstanding.""
Schumer made the remarks after he and U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi concluded a three-hour meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows at the Capitol on Saturday.
Mnuchin told reporters the talks were constructive but had reached an ""impasse"" over whether to come to a short-term agreement or a more comprehensive deal.

Congress for the past several months has been unable to reach an accord for a next round of economic relief from a pandemic that has killed more than 150,000 Americans and triggered the sharpest economic collapse since the Great Depression.
In a meeting late Thursday between top White House officials and congressional Democratic leaders, negotiations focused on an extension of the $600 per week in federal unemployment benefits that Americans who lost jobs due to the pandemic have been receiving in addition to state jobless payments. 
Pelosi said on Friday that she rejected an offer by Republican President Donald Trump's administration to continue the $600 payments for one more week.

Senate Republicans have said the $600 payments are an incentive to stay home rather than return to work. Their proposal would provide a much-reduced weekly payment of $200 until states create a system to provide a 70% wage replacement for laid-off workers.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Saturday slammed Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for letting the Senate go home for the weekend without a deal to extend the unemployment benefits or protect renters facing eviction.
""Because Donald Trump is abdicating his responsibility to lead us out of the pandemic crisis and the economic crisis, we now face a potential housing crisis across the country,"" Biden said in a statement.

Huntington Ingalls' shipbuilding unit earlier this year received a $138 million judgment from a Mississippi court against Venezuela's defense ministry over non-payment for repairs to two of the South American country's warships which began decades ago.
The repairs began before Washington-Caracas relations grew hostile, under late socialist President Hugo Chavez.
Oil-rich Venezuela has suffered a six-year economic collapse under Nicolas Maduro, Chavez' successor and mentee, and the government owes billions to creditors abroad.
On Friday, Huntington Ingalls registered its Mississippi judgment in Delaware federal court and requested the case be assigned to a judge overseeing an effort by Canadian gold miner Crystallex to collect on debts owed by Venezuela by seizing a stake in the parent company of U.S. refiner Citgo Petroleum Corp, a unit of Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA.
""We anticipate that Ingalls will next file a Petition for a Writ of Attachment on Citgo parent PDV Holding and get in line,"" Russ Dallen, managing partner of boutique investment bank Caracas Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients.
Neither Huntington Ingalls nor Venezuela's information ministry immediately responded to requests for comment.
To be sure, all companies are currently barred from seizing shares in PDV Holding, Citgo's parent, due to U.S. sanctions aimed at ousting Maduro from power.
That protection - part of an effort by the Trump administration to keep Citgo under the control of the Venezuelan opposition - expires in October, but it has previously been extended multiple times.
PDVSA has also used shares in Citgo's parent as collateral for its bonds maturing in 2020 and for a 2017 loan from Russian state oil company Rosneft.

The credit rating agency also said the future direction of U.S. fiscal policy depends in part on the November election for president and the resulting makeup of Congress, cautioning there is a risk policy gridlock could continue.
Debt and deficits, which were already rising before the pandemic, have started to erode the country's traditional credit strengths, Fitch said in a report.
""Financing flexibility, assisted by Federal Reserve intervention to restore liquidity to financial markets, does not entirely dispel risks to medium-term debt sustainability, and there is a growing risk that U.S. policymakers will not consolidate public finances sufficiently to stabilize public debt after the pandemic shock has passed,"" Fitch said.
It added that U.S. government debt, the highest among any AAA-rated sovereign nations heading into the crisis, was expected to exceed 130% of gross domestic product by 2021.
Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics, predicted markets would react negatively to the move.
""It reduces confidence in U.S. financial markets and it does prompt some entities to want to sell Treasuries, so you may see some back up in yields even though no one is really looking for U.S. defaults,"" he said.
Axel Merk, president and chief investment officer at Merk Investments in Palo Alto, California, said investors would probably not react strongly to Fitch's announcement.
“If people really had jitters about U.S. debt, you wouldn’t see bond yields where they are,"" Merk said. ""It’s noteworthy, but with everything happening in the U.S. and other countries, the quality of balance sheets is deteriorating, and that is not a surprise.”
The outlook revision to negative covers a longer time frame, meaning the United States does not face a potential rating downgrade anytime soon. That leaves the country with top ratings from two credit agencies-- Fitch and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service, which affirmed an Aaa rating with a stable outlook in June.
Standard & Poor's Global Ratings, which dropped the country's credit rating by a notch to AA-plus in 2011 in the wake of the financial crisis and Great Recession, has a stable outlook on that rating.
That was the only downgrade to the U.S. rating by major credit agencies in modern times.

1490,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 07:05PM ET</span>","Over half of furloughed UK staff back at work, think tank estimates","LONDON (Reuters) - More than half of the roughly 9 million British employees who were put on furlough during the coronavirus lockdown have already returned to work, the Resolution Foundation think tank estimated on Saturday.
Britain's finance ministry has said furlough payments totalling 32 billion pounds ($42 billion) so far have been made in respect of a cumulative 9.5 million jobs, but does not publish figures on the current number of furloughed workers.
Based on an analysis of surveys of businesses and households from the Office for National Statistics, the Resolution Foundation estimated that the number of furloughed workers is ""certainly below 4.5 million"" and possibly as low as 3 million.
The furlough scheme started alongside the lockdown in March, and is due to end in October, after which many economists fear unemployment could rise sharply, surpassing the peak seen after the financial crisis.
Official data on Thursday showed big differences between sectors, with more than 90% of information technology and sewerage workers not furloughed, but almost half of staff in the hospitality, arts and leisure sectors still needing help.
""These workers face a heightened risk of unemployment as the Job Retention Scheme starts to be phased out,"" Resolution Foundation economist Dan Tomlinson said.
From this month, employers must begin to contribute to the cost of paying furloughed workers, who receive 80% of their normal salary.
Last week, Britain's National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the opposition Labour Party called for the programme to be extended until the middle of next year.
But finance minister Rishi Sunak has repeatedly rejected calls for an extension, and his deputy Steve Barclay said workers' skills were likely to degrade if they spent more than eight months off work, waiting for a job that might not return.
Employers will receive 1,000 pounds for each furloughed worker they take back and keep employed until the end of January.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four U.S. Senate Democrats on Friday pressed new Postmaster General Louis DeJoy about complaints from Americans about slow delivery since he took office in June and whether service problems could hinder attempts to mail in 2020 election ballots during the pandemic.
Gary Peters, top Democrat on the committee overseeing the Postal Service, along with Amy Klobuchar, Tom Carper and Charles Schumer sought answers about mail delivery under DeJoy, a top supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump who was also finance chair for the 2020 Republican National Convention.
""Recent concerns raised by constituents and postal workers have brought to light questionable changes under your leadership now taking place in post offices and processing centers across the nation that may negatively impact mail delivery,"" the senators wrote DeJoy who took office in June. ""It is essential that the Postal Service not slow down mail or in any way compromise service.""
The senators raised concerns that delaying mail deliveries could hinder attempts to mail in ballots for the 2020 election by Americans nervous about voting in person during a pandemic.
Trump has repeatedly said he believes millions of mail-in ballots would cause problems.
On July 20, senior House Democrats warned in a letter that ""increases in mail delivery timing would impair the ability of ballots to be received and counted in a timely manner — an unacceptable outcome for a free and fair election.""
The senators cited Postal Service documents that discussed limiting carrier trips from processing centers to deliver mail and eliminating overtime and other cost-cutting measures.
A Postal Service spokesman said the agency ""is taking immediate steps to increase operational efficiency by re-emphasizing existing plans that have been designed to provide prompt and reliable service within current service standards.""
He added the ""Postal Service is developing a business plan to ensure that we will be financially stable"" that will be presented to the Board of Governors when it is finalized.

The Postal Service has faced financial woes with the rise of email and social media, and a measure passed in 2006 requiring it to prefund 75 years of retiree health benefits over the span of 10 years at a cost of more than $100 billion.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa will not implement a universal basic income grant until at least March, Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu said in an interview on Friday, rolling back a pledge to have it ready by October.
Zulu unexpectedly announced the plan two weeks, reviving a policy that was the centrepiece of Nelson Mandela's government when apartheid fell in 1994.
Zulu told Reuters a draft policy would be ready at the end of the financial year, in March. In the meantime, she would seek support from cabinet colleagues.
""In cabinet, no one has come to me and said this is nonsense,"" she said. ""We're having the conversation, but I still need support in implementation.""
An emergency unemployment grant of 350 rand ($20.57), as well as top-ups to existing child and old age grants, were introduced earlier this year as South Africa entered a pandemic lockdown.
They are due to expire in October, but Zulu said it was unrealistic to expect a universal basic income grant by then.
No country pays out an unconditional universal basic income, according to the World Bank, but the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus has put the idea back on the table, even in fiscally conservative countries.
The United Nations says a temporary basic income for the world's poorest 2.7 billion people could help slow the spread of the virus.
Zulu's plan has been welcomed by unions and civil society, but the presidency and the treasury have yet to give explicit backing.
Guy Standing, professor of development studies at London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) and former adviser to the labour ministry, said Zulu was making ""good noises"" but needed cabinet support, especially from the finance ministry:

""Now's the opportunity for (finance minister Tito) Mboweni to go back to the man he was in the 1990s ... who has these transformative ideas in his mind. He can help Minister Zulu.""

1493,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>","Extending $600 Jobless Benefits Could Save Lives, Fed Study Says","(Bloomberg) -- As Congress debates extending generous unemployment benefits, a new report says that keeping certain workers away from their jobs would save thousands of lives.
The CARES Act unemployment benefits will increase U.S. unemployment by an average of 3.7 percentage points from April to December 2020, but it would also reduce cumulative death by 4.7% and save 27,000 lives, according to a working paper posted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on its website Friday.
The extra $600 per week unemployment benefit is set to expire on Friday and Congress has yet to agree on a new stimulus package. Critics of the added insurance argue that it reduces the incentive for employment for those who get more money from being unemployed than they would by going back to work.
“More generous UI policies create work disincentives and lead to higher unemployment,” the researchers said in the paper, while also noting that jobs requiring close contact with other employees and the public increases infection rates and potential deaths.
The working paper, which was authored by economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, found that reducing the extra benefit to $200 a week would still increase the unemployment rate by 3 percentage points between August and December.
Shutdown measures amplify the effects of unemployment insurance by increasing the base of the unemployed, according to the paper.
“Between young and old people, the old in general prefer more mitigation policies, especially shutdown policy, because of their higher probability to die from the virus,” the researchers found.

The University of Michigan’s final sentiment index for July was 72.5, compared with a preliminary reading of 73.2 and June’s final reading of 78.1, according to data Friday. The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 72.9. The latest figure is just above the eight-year low recorded in April.
The gauge of current conditions fell 4.3 points to 82.8 and compared with the preliminary reading of 84.2, while a measure of expectations dropped to 65.9, matching the six-year low from May.
Besides the climb in virus cases, the decline in optimism highlights the precarious state of consumer finances, with lawmakers failing to reach agreement on extending the $600 in extra federal jobless benefits that have propped up incomes and spending. The survey also indicated that lower-income households are seeing higher inflation thanks to rising food prices.
“The lapse of the special jobless benefits will directly hurt the most vulnerable and spread even further by missed rent, mortgage, and other debt payments,’’ Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said in a statement.
In a special set of questions tied to the election, the survey found respondents gave an edge to President Donald Trump over Democratic challenger Joe Biden on who would be better for economic growth and personal finances, though a plurality of 42% said neither had an advantage on finances.
While there’s still a big gap in sentiment between Democrats and Republicans, both groups saw declines in consumer confidence in July, along with independents.
The Michigan survey was conducted June 24 to July 27. The cutoff for the preliminary results was July 15.

1495,By Euronews,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",Amazon given go ahead to launch thousands of satellites to boost internet access worldwide,"Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was on Thursday granted regulatory approval to create a satellite constellation as part of a $10 billion (€8.4 billion) project to provide affordable internet to underserved communities around the world.
Amazon's Project Kuiper will compete with the Starlink constellation being set up by Elon Musk's SpaceX.
David Limp, Amazon's Senior Vice President, welcomed the positive order from the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in a blog post, writing: ""We have heard so many stories lately about people who are unable to do their job or complete schoolwork because they don't have reliable internet at home.""
""There are still too many places where broadband access is unreliable or where it doesn't exist at all. Kuiper will change that,"" he added.
The FCC granted approval after a 5-0 vote in favour. It argued in the order authorisation that Kuiper ""would advance the public interest by authorising a system designed to increase the availability of high-speed broadband service to consumers, government, and businesses.""
Amazon's constellation will total 3,286 low Earth orbit satellites which will operate in 98 orbital planes at altitudes of between 590 km to 630 km. It will eventually provide coverage to places ranging in latitude from 56 degrees north to 56 degrees south — nearly the entire inhabited surface of the globe.
According to the United Nations, the vast majority of the 3.7 billion people in developing countries are still unconnected.
No date has been given as to when Project Kuiper would come online but the FCC requires the company to launch and operate half of its constellation by July 2026 with the remaining half to be operational by mid-2029.
Kuiper can start its service once its first 578 satellites are launched.
SpaceX's Starlink was granted FCC approval back in 2018 and has already launched 500 of its planned 12,000 satellites. Some 420 were operational in April. It anticipated earlier this year that it would be able to begin offering commercial service in North America by the end of the year."
1496,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 09:36AM ET</span>",U.S. Incomes Fell in June as One-Time Stimulus Boost Faded,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. incomes fell more than expected in June as the effects of the government’s one-time stimulus checks dissipated, though an increase in unemployment-insurance payments pointed to the importance of expiring federal relief.
Personal incomes declined 1.1% from the prior month, a Commerce Department report showed Friday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.6% decline. Consumer spending increased 5.6% in June, after jumping by the most on record a month earlier.
While the income decline reflected the continued unwinding of April’s sharp gain from one-time stimulus, unemployment insurance payments actually increased in June by an annualized $111 billion -- likely reflecting states working through backlogs of applications, even though joblessness has declined. That increase, stemming mainly from the federal government’s supplemental $600 in weekly jobless benefits, highlights the importance of the payments that expire today, with Congress failing to reach an agreement on additional aid.
Wages and salaries rose 2.2%, reflecting rehiring as more businesses reopened across the country, though such compensation remained well below pre-pandemic levels.
The pace of the economic rebound appears to be cooling amid a resurgence in virus cases, and only 7.5 million of the 22 million jobs lost because of the pandemic had come back as of June. If re-hiring fails to come back quickly, a steep dropoff in the federal support for the jobless could have significant implications both for incomes and ultimately personal consumption, the lifeblood of the U.S. economy, in the coming months.
Even though consumer spending posted a record increase in May and rose again in June, the level of spending remains below pre-pandemic levels. A Commerce Department report out Thursday showed inflation-adjusted personal spending fell at a record 34.6% annualized rate in the second quarter, with outlays for services plummeting at a 43.5% pace.
Real spending climbed 5.2% in June after surging 8.4% a month earlier. The increase in outlays last month was broad-based, reflecting an 8.8% jump in durable goods and a 5% pickup in services.
The personal savings rate, which had surged to a record in April as a result of the rise in government social benefits, fell for a second month to 19% from 24.2%.
The gauge of consumer prices that the Federal Reserve officially uses for its target rose 0.8% in June from a year earlier, well below the central bank’s 2% goal. The core price index, which excludes more-volatile food and energy costs, increased 0.9%.

August can be a tricky time for markets. It was the month Russia defaulted (1998), China devalued the yuan (2015) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) kicked off subprime meltdown by freezing three of its funds (2007). 
Plenty could go wrong this August as the world economy staggers under the pandemic, Sino-U.S. tensions bubble and the U.S. election contest gets ugly. Now watch Turkey, at risk of repeating the 2018 lira crisis. 
The lira tumbled 2% against a weakening dollar in July, and there's little ammunition to defend it. Policy credibility is low, Ankara is sparring with several foreign powers and real rates are negative. The 20% year-to-date currency loss against a euro-dollar basket is raising unease over Turkish borrowers' hard currency debt pile.
In January 2014, the central bank abruptly upped interest rates by several percentage points to lift the lira. Similar action could prevent another August of distress.

2/LOCKDOWN BLUES TO BEATS 
At half-time for the Q2 earnings season, it's showering ""beats"" both sides of the Atlantic. Analysts, flying blind as companies withdrew guidance at the height of the pandemic, were perhaps too pessimistic.
Here's the scorecard on 250-plus companies that have so far released numbers in each region: 80% of S&P500 companies beat estimates, versus 65% of European firms, Refinitiv IBES data shows.
While industrial names such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) delivered big positive surprises, the season also cemented U.S. tech's hegemony; Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported its biggest profit ever, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) smashed estimates and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone sales surpassed expectations.
But while beats come in left, right and centre, it's not been enough to move the needle on stock markets, which had already written off second-quarter results due to lockdown blues.

3/HOW LOW CAN THEY GO? How much further can Treasury yields drop? The record Q2 U.S. economic contraction sent three, five-and 20-year yields to record lows. The entire yield curve is close to falling under 1%.
A fresh trigger for further falls could be July's unemployment figures. June payrolls surged by 4.8 million, surpassing expectations of 3 million additions, while July data on Aug. 7 is predicted to show a 2.2 million increase. 
Weekly jobless claims meanwhile continue to rise. As a supplementary jobless benefits scheme expires, chances of a yield uptick appear slim.

4/TOFU TRADE
A raft of upcoming Chinese data will show us how the economy is recovering from the coronavirus. Particular focus will be on trade figures due Aug. 7, which also offer a check-in on the U.S./China trade deal.
Imports rose last month for the first time since the pandemic hit, showing a strong rebound in purchases from the United States. But more big increases will be needed if farm goods buying is to match ambitious targets.    
Sector detail will be absent from Friday's figures. But with Sino-U.S. tension simmering before meetings scheduled in August to review the Phase 1 deal's progress, evidence of solid buying would be a good sign.

5/BOE TO SAVE BULLETS 
Like the ECB and Fed at their latest meetings, the Bank of England may just choose to sit back and assess economic recovery at its Aug. 6 meeting. It's among the central banks holding out against negative interest rates; analysts reckon it won't move its borrowing costs until end-2021.
Some are surprised by markets' reluctance to pressure the BOE for rate cuts. Signs are recovery will be slow and the UK needs to seal an EU trade deal before the Brexit transition period ends on Dec. 31. 
But the BOE stance may be prudent. Instead it may opt to add another 70 billion pounds to its bond-purchase plan, after a 100 billion pound increase last month. 
With the clock ticking on the Brexit deadline, the BOE may want to hold on to its remaining bullets.

However, the economy had improved in June from the previous month following the easing of a lockdown to curb the spread, which has battered tourism and domestic activity.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso described the yen's recent rise as ""rapid"" on Friday, signalling concern that a strong currency could add pain to an export-led economy already in recession because of the novel coronavirus.
The yen's recent appreciation comes as the world's third-largest economy has been bottoming out from its deepest postwar slump, with authorities juggling a restart of economic activity with efforts to prevent a second wave of coronavirus infections.
The currency had been stable at around 107 yen to the dollar under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe administration, Aso told reporters after a cabinet meeting. 
""Stability is important, so I'm closely monitoring it with a sense of urgency.""
The dollar hit a 4-1/2-month low of 104.195 yen  on Friday as investors worried that a recovery in the U.S. economy could be stymied by a second wave of coronavirus.
Japanese shares closed lower on Friday as the safe-haven yen strengthened on dismal U.S. data, while the resurgence of COVID-19 cases dampened hopes of a swift economic rebound, prompting authorities to discuss a response to market moves.
""The government and the Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on underlying market and economic trends and tackle as one as needed,"" Kenji Okamura, vice finance minister for international affairs, told reporters after a routine meeting with officials from the central bank and the Financial Services Agency.
A Japanese government panel acknowledged on Thursday that the economy peaked in October 2018 and fell into recession, suggesting it was struggling long before its more recent coronavirus slump.
""We have taken steps to support domestic demand rather than external, helping employment and household income improve, which led to a moderate economic recovery,"" Aso said.
Aso said exports accounted for less than 20% of Japan's economy, shrugging off any immediate impact from the yen's rise but the fact that he warned against the currency's gains underscored authorities' struggle to boost external demand.
Japanese authorities tend to fire warning shots against excessive currency volatility and disorderly moves at a time of market strains.

Tokyo has stayed out of the currency market since 2011 when it intervened heavily by selling the yen to prevent a strong currency from hurting an economy facing damage from a devastating earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster.

Using government support, hundreds of businesses have undertaken to invest in machinery and factories that must start production within a year, he said.
""In 2021 we will see an investment boom in the Hungarian economy not seen for a long time,"" Orban told state radio.
He cautioned that a second wave of the new coronavirus would seriously hinder economic recovery.
Orban's chief of staff said on Thursday the government would not relax measures to contain COVID-19 after cases increased in several neighbouring countries.
This month, the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) eased the terms of its 1.5 trillion forint ($5.18 billion) cheap loans scheme designed to help local businesses gain access to cheap funding to overcome the coronavirus pandemic.
The new terms allow companies to use the loans, which carry a maximum interest of 2.5%, to finance foreign investments and pre-finance projects backed by domestic government funds.
Small businesses can also use the loans to finance current expenditures. Initial results showed just a small portion of the new loans went into investments. 
The NBH, headed by an Orban ally, still expects the economy to grow by 0.3% to 2% this year. Hungary's finance Minister said last week said the economy would contract by 5%, downgrading an earlier forecast for 3% recession. 
Last year the economy, which is dependent on exports and to a large extent on the auto industry, grew by 4.9%.

PRAGUE/WARSAW (Reuters) - When Alftins' private backer pulled out of a financing deal in March due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Slovak blockchain startup had another option - publicly-funded venture firm Crowdberry.
After losing out on the original deal in November, Crowdberry managed to secure better terms the second time round, while Alftins got the money it needed. 
""This was the path of least resistance and they (Crowdberry) were a very good strategic partner,"" said Alftins founder Richard Fetyko, whose company is developing an online platform to trade digital assets. 
The episode underlines how some publicly-backed venture firms are stepping up to keep seed money flowing to infant companies in former communist countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary as private investors retreat from the region's nascent startup scene.
""A number of emerging companies will have no other choice but to tap these funds because private money will be very cautious because of the pandemic,"" Crowdberry partner Michal Nespor told Reuters. 
Before the pandemic, many startups in central and eastern Europe (CEE) preferred private investors, who often offer better valuations and links to global investors in places like Silicon Valley for bigger funding rounds later on, company founders and venture firms say.
But with private seed money drying up, they are increasingly turning to publicly-funded options as they look to create the region's next $1 billion ""unicorn"", following in the footsteps of Polish online marketplace Allegro, Romanian software firm UiPath, and new FTSE 100 member Avast.
Martin Bodocky, general partner of publicly-funded Czech venture firm Nation 1, said companies like his offered greater stability than private investors, with their limited partners more likely to continue providing money during a crisis. 
""Public funding offers a protection and an advantage. We don't expect any venture capital firm to die here,"" he said. 
Much of the money that flows into early stage CEE venture capital funds comes from the European Investment Fund (EIF), said Michal Kosina, the EIF's senior mandate manager responsible for several CEE-focused investment programmes.
While the EIF finances firms across Europe, it may take particularly high stakes in CEE funds given the overall lack of private - especially institutional - investors there, he added.
""In times of crisis, limited partners may lower their appetite for this asset class and in some cases may even default on or try to renegotiate their existing commitments,"" he said. ""So, in this sense, the public capital in the region is good for startups because with public sources the money remains there.""
BUSY TIME
CEE countries offer a host of advantages for new businesses including a long tradition of producing graduates strong in maths and computer science and a low cost base that allows entrepreneurs to do more with less as companies grow.
In 2019, CEE venture funding hit nearly 1.4 billion euros ($1.6 billion), surging from 223 million euros in 2013, according to data from funding research firm Dealroom.co. The region has produced 12 unicorns with a combined value of 30 billion euros and offers a promising pipeline of startups. 
The amount is a fraction of the 38.8 billion euros raised in Europe in 2019, according to Dealroom.co data. But the growth has attracted an increasing number of global investors for later stage deals, founders and venture firms say.
For early stage deals, though, public funds can play a key role.
Bence Katona, chief executive of Hungarian state-owned investor Hiventures, told Reuters his firm had increased funding for startups to help them weather the pandemic. 
Hiventures was the most active seed investor in European companies in 2019, directing money to 76 startups, according to data from Crunchbase. Its investments include PanIQ Room, which franchises escape room attractions such as MagIQ Room and The Prison, and tech firm SignAll, which translates sign language. 
""Market players won't take that risk now,"" Katona said. ""I am seeing they are waiting to see what will happen in the next three months. We made more investments during this period. It has been a busy time for us.""
Michael Zalesak, co-founder of Czech-based Lighthouse Ventures, is similarly active. 
""We are getting more deal flow because angel investing has dropped significantly,"" he said, noting his firm had closed six deals valued at more than 2 million euros in total since the pandemic began.
Startups in Poland, the biggest CEE economy, are also turning to state-backed funding options, such as PFR Ventures.
""Financing with involvement of public funds was more attractive from our perspective because we could raise much more capital,"" said Przemyslaw Berendt, CEO of Polish startup Talent Alpha, which in 2019 raised $5 million.
Private investors are still doing deals. 
Andrej Kiska of Prague-based Credo Ventures said his group had closed three since March and was close to wrapping up a few others. 
But while company founders may dream of prestige and contacts that come with a global investor, he said local venture capital firms currently offered the most important commodity. 
""These days cash is king and this will keep deals flowing,"" Kiska said.

1508,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 01:35AM ET</span>",Bank of England to keep policy on hold as COVID prognosis murky,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's central bank will shed more light next week on how fast it expects the economy to rebound from the financial damage wrought by COVID-19, but is unlikely to add to the 100 billion pounds ($131 billion) of stimulus it announced in June.
The world's sixth-largest economy shrank by almost a quarter between February and May, and some economists think it could be years before it returns to its previous size.
Back in May the Bank of England (BoE) said its best guess was that the economy would return to its previous size in the second half of 2021, but since then several policymakers have warned this relatively 'V'-shaped recovery could be delayed.
The BoE said stimulus announced in June would fund bond purchases until the turn of the year - albeit at a slower pace than before - which in the view of Investec economist Philip Shaw makes November rather than August the next key decision.
""For now, we're at: 'Okay, let's set the tiller steady ... keep rates on hold, and just see what's going on in the economy',"" he said.
Economists polled by Reuters last week on average predicted the BoE would keep the Bank Rate at its record low of 0.1% this year and next, but that policymakers would announce 70 billion pounds of asset purchases in November or December.
Initial signs of recovery have been fairly promising, with retail sales almost back at pre-pandemic levels in June, and closely watched Purchasing Managers' Index data suggesting the fastest growth since 2015 in July.
BoE chief economist Andy Haldane described the recovery as ""so far, so 'V'"", after voting against June's stimulus.
But BoE policymakers such as Jonathan Haskel and Silvana Tenreyro have warned of the economy ""getting stuck"" or seeing an ""incomplete 'V'"", once an initial boost from pent-up consumer demand falters and households remain wary of COVID dangers.
While finance minister Rishi Sunak announced temporary tax cuts this month to encourage people to eat out in restaurants, stay in hotels and buy new homes, health minister Matt Hancock has warned of the risk of a second wave of infection.
Unemployment is likely to rise sharply in November after the end of a government furlough scheme that has supported 9.5 million jobs, unless there is a revival in restaurants and entertainment venues where almost half of staff are furloughed. 
The BoE's latest forecast for unemployment will be closely eyed, after it pencilled in a jump in the fourth-quarter jobless rate to nearly 10% in May, exceeding the peak in the 2008-09 financial crisis.
Governor Andrew Bailey is also sure to be asked about the BoE's latest thinking on cutting interest rates below zero - something he has said the BoE will consider, but which is far from a certainty due to practical difficulties.

""Banks have to have time to implement a possible negative rate structure, and there are all sorts of technical complications as well,"" Shaw said.

1509,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 12:45AM ET</span>",Right-wing former Brazilian minister elected to board of World Bank,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Abraham Weintraub, a right-wing former Brazilian education minister, has been elected as an executive director of the World Bank, according to a statement by the Bank, whose staff had raised concerns about Weintraub's past racial comments.
Weintraub is expected to fill a vacant position on the board in the first week of August and will serve until the current term ends on Oct. 31, when the position will re-open for election, the Bank said in the statement https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/statement/2020/07/31/updated-world-bank-statement-on-the-executive-director-for-brazil?cid=EXT_WBEmailShare_EXT on its website.
It said Weintraub was elected by the constituency representing Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Haiti, Panama, the Philippines, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago, but gave no details on the vote tally. Brazil has a majority of the voting power in the group of nine countries.
The previous executive director resigned in December.
The association representing staff at the World Bank last month asked that Brazil's nomination of Weintraub to be executive director be reviewed over comments on Twitter in which Weintraub mocked Chinese accents, blamed China for COVID-19, and accused China of seeking to dominate the world.
Weintraub resigned as education minister in June and said he was joining the World Bank, after he became the target of a Supreme Court probe for calling its judges ""bums"" who should be jailed. Brazil's federal audit court is now investigating whether he inappropriately used a diplomatic passport to travel to the United States, skirting quarantine rules.
World Bank employees in June urged the bank's ethics committee to suspend Weintraub's nomination while reviewing whether his statements were in line with a 28-page code of conduct for directors, which expressly requires respect for diversity.

In response to the staff's letter, the chair of the board's ethics committee, Guenther Schoenleitner, had said the World Bank had no influence over the appointment of executive directors, but would not tolerate racist remarks by anyone serving at the institution.

1510,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 11:27PM ET</span>",North Korea’s Economy Showed Some Resilience Before Pandemic,"(Bloomberg) -- North Korea’s economy managed to eke out growth last year, rebounding from the worst contraction in decades, but the situation has likely deteriorated as the pandemic forced the country to shut its borders.
Gross domestic product increased 0.4% in 2019, according to estimates released by South Korea’s central bank on Friday. The rebound follows a 4.1% contraction the previous year as international sanctions took a toll on North Korea’s output.
The expansion shows North Korea may be learning to survive under heavy international sanctions and secure the financial wherewithal to continue its pursuit of nuclear and missile programs. Economic prospects for this year have become even more dismal, as the pandemic hurt North Korea’s biggest economic partner, China, and decimated what little external trade it had.
North Korea has joined the world in quarantine efforts against Covid-19 even though the state has so far denied any confirmed cases. Japanese Defense Minister Taro Kono said last month that he believes the disease may be spreading there and Kim Jong Un is keeping to himself to avoid infection.
North Korea’s exports rose 14% in 2019 to $278 million, mostly due to the base effect of a weak performance in 2018 when sanctions intensified, the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency in Seoul said this week. Imports jumped to $3 billion, worsening the country’s trade deficit.
More than 95% of North Korean trade is with China. China has beefed up its enforcement of sanctions since the Pyongyang regime’s sixth nuclear test in 2017.
Due to sanctions that ban shipments of North Korean minerals and fabric, its key exports have shifted to clocks and components, according to the South Korean trade agency.
Per capita income in North Korea was estimated at 1.41 million won ($1,184) in 2019, or about 3.8% percent that of South Korea, the BOK said.
North Korea in June blew up a building meant to symbolize friendship with South Korea, an act that some analysts interpreted as its way of demanding help amid sanctions and the pandemic-driven trade halt.

The bank's previous forecast in April predicted a 3.6% contraction by the end of 2020. To date, coronavirus infections in Costa Rica total more than 17,000 cases in addition to 140 confirmed deaths, according to the government's official count. 
Bank chief Rodrigo Cubero said he sees a ""probable, partial recovery"" next year with 2.3% economic growth, but cautioned that the estimate could change depending on the course of the pandemic.
The economy's second-quarter contraction reached 9%, Cubero said, with the country's key tourist industry comprising hotels and restaurants shrinking by almost half.
President Carlos Alvarado offered a plan this week for a staggered reopening of the economy from Saturday in a bid to reignite economic activity and help businesses plan ahead.

The government is also pursuing spending cuts and considering its credit lines, especially the Stand-By Arrangement it has with the International Monetary Fund that could provide $2.25 billion over the next few years.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan on Friday appointed its top economist as head of a department overseeing research on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), as it steps up efforts to keep pace with a global drive towards embracing financial innovation.
Kazushige Kamiyama will head the BOJ's payments and settlement department, which has conducted joint research with other central banks on CBDCs and looked into how the growing presence of crypto-currencies could affect central banking.
The appointment comes at a time the BOJ is shifting away from its caution over the idea of issuing its own digital currency in the future.
It has recently set up a task force focusing on CBDC research and is seeking private-sector expertise to better understand the evolution of digital currencies.
As the BOJ's top economist, Kamiyama spearheaded efforts to use more big data in analysing the economy - an approach that helped the central bank catch real-time changes affecting the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Seisaku Kameda will succeed Kamiyama as the central bank's top economist and head of its statistics department, the BOJ said in a statement.
Japan has been cautious about moving too quickly on digital currencies given the social disruptions it may cause in a country that has the most cash-loving population in the world.
But China's steady progress toward issuing CBDCs has prompted the government to more closely look into the idea of issuing CBDCs.

While the BOJ has said it has no immediate plans to issue its own digital currency, it has been conducting research with other central banks on the issue.

Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio expressed confidence that the economy would pick up in the third quarter, and stressed that recovery to pre-pandemic levels depends to a large degree on creating and then distributing an effective vaccine for the disease.
The finance ministry forecasts a 7.4% contraction in gross domestic product this year, according to a ministry document released later on Thursday, compared with a 2% expansion that was previously estimated in the government's 2020 budget.
In a virtual presentation, Yorio confirmed that conornavirus lockdowns have depressed tax collections, but said the government still had room to maneuver. 
He added that issuing new debt to soften the economic blow of the coronavirus lockdowns could be possible in the event of a new wave of infections.
""We hope we don't need to use that option,"" said Yorio.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has to date pledged to not raise taxes or take on new debt, arguing that his government can manage the pandemic and other priorities with existing resources, rooting out corruption and cutting spending elsewhere. 
According to ministry document, the government projects that by the end of 2020 the peso currency will trade at 22.1 pesos per U.S. dollar. 
It also sees Mexico's oil production at 1.744 million barrels per day by the end of the year, at an average price of $34.4 per barrel for the country's export basket.

Mexico's economy contracted by more than 17% in the second quarter as the coronavirus pandemic shut factories, kept shoppers and tourists at home and upended trade, according to preliminary figures from national statistics agency INEGI earlier on Thursday.

1514,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>","As pandemic rages on, world economic recovery looks ever more shaky: Reuters poll","By Shrutee Sarkar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The world economic outlook has dimmed again, with still-rising coronavirus infections and the risk of renewed lockdowns increasing the chances that any rebound will reverse course, according to Reuters polls of over 500 economists globally.
Over 17 million people have been infected worldwide by the coronavirus and more than two-thirds of a million people have died. That has forced governments to impose strict lockdown measures to curb the spread of the virus, keeping citizens at home and businesses closed and spurring recessions that aren't over yet.
Surging cases in the United States, where related deaths have surpassed 150,000, have led several states to reimpose restrictions. Most economists, long-term investors and even Fed Chair Jerome Powell have clearly said the economic outlook depends significantly on the course of the virus.
The Fed has pledged endless stimulus to support the world's No. 1 economy, which was a major growth engine for the global economy before the pandemic and now risks being the biggest drag, sending the dollar to a two-year low.
With infections also on the rise elsewhere, including in Australia, India, Spain, and Brazil, economists again cut this year's economic prospects in the July 3-29 polls which show the worst contraction on record for the world economy in 2020.
""We expect the economic reality of the virus to start catching up with businesses across the globe soon,"" said Jan Lambregts, global head financial markets research at Rabobank.
""What we need is a vaccine or significant breakthroughs in medicines to decisively reopen our economies and restore business and consumer confidence – but there is no magic wand for the time being.""
Reuters polls since the start of the pandemic follow a pattern: repeated downgrades to the near-term outlook, with economists shifting an expected recovery in the second half of the year to 2021, flattening out an initial V-shaped assumption. 
The global economy was expected to shrink 4.0% this year, or by about $3.4 trillion, roughly equivalent to wiping out the economies of Canada and Australia entirely. That is down from -3.7% predicted in June, the sixth consecutive downgrade to forecasts from 3.1% growth forecast in January.
(For graphic on Reuters Poll: Global 2020 GDP forecast revisions, click: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/jbyprkmdrve/Global%20economic%20outlook.PNG)
The world economy is expected to grow 5.3% next year, slightly less than the 5.4% predicted last month. But those expectations are based on the disease being contained, with widespread hopes of a vaccine sometime soon.
But under a worst-case scenario, it will contract 6.5% this year, much worse than the International Monetary Fund's -4.9% projection, then grow just 2.0% next year.
""Over six months into the crisis, evidence is mounting that the global economy is likely to look lastingly different due to the pandemic,"" noted Christian Keller, head of economics research at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""Changes have been obvious in the attitude towards monetary and fiscal policy, but they also extend to global trade, supply chains, international travel and geopolitics.""
The economic outlook for the U.S., Canada, Britain, Japan and Australia was downgraded and expectations for 2021 growth are modest given the historic downturn expected this year. 
Of all of the major economies, the proportion of forecasters who said the U.S. outlook had improved in the last month was, by far, the smallest.
For the euro zone, the outlook for next year onward got a slight boost after the European Union leaders agreed on a stimulus package of 750 billion euros.
Latin America are mostly still struggling, suffering historic recessions and either facing resurgent infections or still not getting the first round under control.
China, where the virus is thought to have originated, was expected to recover faster economically than others, even though it still relies heavily on exporting to the rest of the world. 
Asked how the recovery outlook had changed over the past month, three-quarters of economists, or 183 of 244, said it had either stayed the same or worsened.
(For graphic on Reuters Poll: Global economic outlook, click: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/xlbpgbjdbvq/Global%20wrap%20graphic%20(5).png)
Just over half, 75 of 149, who responded to another question said it would take two or more years for GDP in the economies they cover to reach pre-COVID-19 levels. Sixty expected it would take at least a year or two and the remaining 14 said less than a year.

""Our forecasts point to a world which, by end-2021, has a level of activity that is not just well below its pre-pandemic growth trajectory but, in many cases, still below its end-2019 level,"" noted HSBC's global chief economist Janet Henry.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - It was billed by the government as a kickstart to the coronavirus-stricken economy of Australia's biggest city: a new tech hub in a forest of skyscrapers built over 24 hectares (59 acres) of railyards in downtown Sydney.
But with offices largely empty as workers stay home, the project may flood the city with commercial floorspace, putting more pressure on landlords already struggling to fill the void, industry sources say. 
Sydney already has 500,000 square metres of new offices due for completion in the next four years, according to industry data - not much less than London, which has double the population. 
The new tech hub, led by office giant Dexus (AX:DXS) and Singapore's  Frasers Centrepoint Trust  (SI:FCRT), with local technology star Atlassian Plc (O:TEAM) as an anchor tenant, would increase Sydney's new available floorspace by half again when completed in 2025.
""I don't think anyone can say with certainty what sort of demand they're going to be met with in 2024, 2025,"" said Anneke Thompson, the local head of research at Colliers (TO:CIGI), referring to the project.
""Sydney and Melbourne ... have got projects that have been built for years now and they're about to reach completion. They will add quite a bit of supply to the market, and the supply that that leaves behind ... will probably take longer than what we anticipated to lease up.""
Six months ago, Colliers forecast Sydney CBD office vacancies would peak at 6.8% in 2024, from 3.7% then. Now it says vacancies could hit 10% two years sooner, thanks to COVID-19.
 Jones Lang LaSalle Inc  (N:JLL), which manages 480 office blocks nationwide, estimated Sydney occupancy as low as one-fifth in July.
""Some organisations are starting to put some space on the market and that's a direct function of the pandemic, but I think there's a lot who are still getting their heads around things,"" said JLL's local head of office leasing, Tim O'Connor.
Dexus declined to comment. The New South Wales state government, which approved the new project, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
A Frasers Centrepoint spokesperson said there was ""strong interest"" from tech companies for the precinct, with the potential for the development to be staged in line with market demand.
Atlassian has not committed to an amount of floorspace in the new build. Its co-CEO Scott Farquhar said in an email that ""even with a highly distributed workforce, we'll need a place to come together"", adding ""we can design this space especially for these new ways of working.""
LOW RENT
Since February, some of the biggest stock declines are landlords of brick-and-mortar retailers as lockdowns halted physical commerce.
Shares of mall giants  Scentre  Group (AX:SCG) and Vicinity Centres (AX:VCX) are down about 44%, while office landlords like Dexus and GPT Group (AX:GPT) are down closer to 30%. The broader market is off by 16%.
But investors now fear the office sell-off will last longer as many employees adapt to, and enjoy, working from home. 
""We're going into recession, it's going to be tougher, tenant demand has already been dropping, and now you've got this new thing to think about which is work from home,"" said Grant Berry, a fund manager who specialises in property stocks for SG Hiscock. 
For now, corporate tenants waiting on new offices say they are sticking to their plans. And even if they have fewer staff in the office, property lessors say they may need more floorspace per person due to social distancing rules.
Software giant Salesforce.Com Inc (N:CRM) said it still wants 24 floors of a new harbourside tower in 2022. Consultant Deloitte said there was no change to its plan to occupy another new tower nearby, despite shedding 7% of its Australian staff.
National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) says it is on course to rent nearly half a new city tower next year.
Tim Brown, managing director of fund manager BlackWall Ltd (AX:BWF), which cancelled a spin-off listing of a shared office management business, citing COVID, said he was looking at an investment close to the planned tech hub despite concerns about the effects of working from home.The reason: a big name anchor tenant. 

""It could well we be the hangoffs from the Atlassian lease there are so big that it can absorb and justify any large amount of office space down there,"" Brown said.

President Nayib Bukele has been forced to back off twice this month on the next stage of his reopening plans, after allowing the food sector, drug stores and gas stations to reopen in June.
Bukele's latest directive, announced on Twitter, will allow industrial activity, shoppiusng malls, indoor dining at restaurants and mass transportation to start up again on Aug. 20.
In the following phase of the plan on Sept. 4, businesses in the so-called informal economy, along with gyms and houses of worship, will be able to resume normal activities.
Commercial flights, sporting events and beaches are seen starting back up from Sept. 19, according to the plan.
Bukele's order, however, stressed that the dates may be altered depending on how the pandemic develops.
The Central American country's schools have been closed to in-person instruction since March, and the new plans made no mention of educational institutions.
To date, El Salvador's official coronavirus tally stands at more than 15,000 confirmed infections and at least 430 deaths.

The South American nation is racing to clinch a deal to avoid a messy and protracted legal standoff with creditors after it slipped into default for the ninth time in May. The deadline for a deal set by the government is currently Aug. 4.
Negotiations, however, are at something on impasse after creditors grouped behind a counter proposal and rejected the ""final"" government offer made in early July.
Asked about extending the deadline, Guzman said that the government was ""assessing all the options"" and would make a decision soon, although he added that it had previously been the plan to set a later deadline.
""We initially had the intention of having a longer deadline on the offer we made. There was a technical issue that prevented that from happening,"" he said during a virtual conference hosted by Washington-based think tank the Atlantic Council.
Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing a source close to the talks, that Argentina's government was considering pushing back the deadline until mid-to-late August.
Guzman said that regardless of what happens with a debt deal with private creditors, the government would initiate talks with the International Monetary Fund for a new program to replace a $57 billion line of credit agreed in 2018.
Guzman said he wanted to reach a quick deal with creditors, but that it had to be sustainable. Creditors are demanding a higher payout and changes to legal clauses in the offer.

""We made a massive effort which basically shows our full commitment of achieving a consensual deal,"" said Guzman. ""This is clearly the maximum effort that Argentina can make and we very much hope creditors come on board and decide to put an end to this situation.""

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 04:05PM ET</span>",Plunging U.S. GDP through June gives way to slow climb back in July,"By Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - A record-setting drop in the U.S. economy from April to June has given way to an increasingly tepid-looking rebound as consumers appear to pull back and businesses slow rehiring, data from a variety of high-frequency sources and macro analysts indicate.
The trend, seen since late June in data on cellphone movement, small business employment and other measures that slowed as the pace of coronavirus infections accelerated, was noted prominently by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in a Wednesday press conference and given new weight by Thursday's report of an increase in the number of people claiming unemployment benefits. 
The hope was for jobless benefits rolls to shrink steadily as the economy rebounded, but they rose by 867,000, to 17,018,000, during the week ended July 18, the first increase since late May.
""The pace of improvement has stalled,"" said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Mellon and a former Fed official. The improvement over May and June was ""sharp,"" he noted, but - as Thursday's report of a 33% drop in second-quarter gross domestic product confirmed - it came after ""a very big downdraft.""
The ""biggest mistake anyone can make is to confuse rebound for recovery,"" Reinhart said, estimating GDP will not reach its prior peak until 2022, and full recovery in the labor market is likely to trail that.
Powell, too, flagged his concern the recovery may be slowing, pointing to a clutch of more timely indicators on which he and other key policymakers increasingly rely.
""All we can say today is that there is evidence in high frequency data and surveys...It looks like we are seeing a slowdown,"" Powell said. ""It might be short-lived, it might not. The timing seems related to the spike in cases"" that began in June.
The surge in COVID-19 cases, particularly in southern and southwestern states, has pushed the death tally above 150,000 and the growth in daily cases above 60,000 - triple what is was in early June.
Following steady increases in May and June, measures of foot traffic to retail stores largely flatlined through July. While cellphone data collected by Unacast showed foot traffic in the nation as a whole edging towards 2019 levels in the week ended July 25, that was largely as a result of improvement outside large states like New York, California, Texas and Florida that account for about a third of the U.S. economy.
GRAPHIC: The economy in real time - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/REOPENING/gjnvwxamxpw/chart.png
Foot traffic in those states, important to any meaningful economic rebound, remained about 28% below 2019, while the other states combined were within 3% of last year's levels. Similar estimates of national foot traffic from Safegraph, indexed to March 1, fell for the third time in five weeks.
Employment at small businesses managed by Homebase fell, while shifts worked at a broader set of industries managed by Kronos declined by 1.1%. Analysis by Kronos showed the ratio of new hires to those laid off remains high, at 2.7 to 1, much closer to the peak of 3.4 to 1 reached in late March than to the late-June low of 1.5 to 1.

Powell flagged the possible ebb in consumer spending in his press conference, a risk tied to ongoing discussions in Congress over whether to extend a $600 per week federal unemployment insurance payment he credited with keeping families afloat in recent weeks - and, according to Thursday's GDP data, even letting them build a savings buffer.
With 17 million collecting unemployment weekly and signals pointing to a hiring slowdown, it is a buffer that could disappear fast.

""A poorly managed health situation and depressed incomes means the economy risks a double-dip recession without urgent fiscal aid,"" wrote Oxford chief U.S. economist Gregory Daco.

1520,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 01:35PM ET</span>",Three ways to make the most from a virtual internship,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As someone who dreams of a career in the music business, Amanda Montgomery had big plans for her summer internship - working in studios, going on shoots for music videos, maybe taking in some live concerts.
Thanks to COVID-19, her internship is looking a little different: Stuck in her Boston apartment in sweatpants. Welcome to the New Normal, circa 2020.
While many employers have scrapped internships altogether, the Berklee College of Music student snared one with NYC-based CAD Management, which handles a roster of artists and helps them with branding and marketing.
But it's virtual, not in-person – and that takes some getting used to.
""Remote working isn't for everyone, and it's definitely not what I thought was going to happen this summer,"" Montgomery, 20, says. ""I'm still gaining a ton of knowledge and experience – it's just very different.""
Indeed, while her days aren't spent in a 9-to-5 office environment, they look very familiar to anyone who works on a freelance basis. Lots of calls, emails, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) meetings, with project-based assignments that she completes at her own pace. One recent task, for instance: Promoting songstress Melanie Iglesias and her new release ""Mr. Magoo"".
In a recent survey, careers community Handshake found that 60% of companies are offering virtual internships. But it is not just interns who are having to adjust their career path. Companies are having to throw out their old playbooks, too.
Take brokerage giant  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), which has a full slate of summer interns, 232 across the whole company. While the firm kept its commitments to every one, instead of ditching the program altogether, it has meant designing a new experience from scratch.
A few of the items on Schwab’s internship menu: Interacting with assigned mentors, participating in executive meet-and-greets, doing personal financial planning, and even arranging virtual volunteer events with Boys & Girls Clubs on the subject of financial literacy.
Most of those interns will return in the fall for their senior year of college, while some graduating students will stay on for full-time work. Elizabeth King, Schwab’s senior vice president of enterprise learning and talent management who oversees the internship programs, expects to learn a few key lessons herself after the nine-week program concludes.
""This is all a massive social experiment,"" King says. ""And by the end of it, we should know a whole lot more about how to engage employees and clients virtually.""
While this new landscape of virtual internships may not be ideal, you can still embrace the challenge and maximize the opportunity. 
Some tips for making the most from this strange internship summer:
SET UP A PROFESSIONAL WORKSPACE
We may all be cooped up in our homes, but you still need to carve out a professional-looking space, because that image will be projected out countless times over the summer. Tidy up your bookshelves, add a low-maintenance plant and consider putting a ring light near your webcam so that you do not look like a ghost on video calls. 
""You are letting your work world into your private space, so the reality is you have to maintain a level of professionalism, and sit up straight and pay attention,"" advises Brea Giffin, marketing director for corporate wellness platform Sprout.
MAINTAIN FOCUS
For those not accustomed to working in a home environment, one major challenge is the temptation all around you. Your snacks are in the fridge, your favorite shows are on the DVR, and your bed is calling you for a nap. That in mind, you need to develop a laser-like focus on the tasks that need to be done.
""It's important to carve out dedicated time to meaningfully complete the work, rather than just doing the work piecemeal between other tasks,"" says Handshake's co-founder and CEO Garrett Lord.
MAKE TIME TO RECHARGE
One interesting thing King has witnessed, with most Schwab employees working from home the past couple of months: Video events can be even more draining than in-person interaction, especially for introverts. 

""Back-to-back video meetings take a lot of energy, and many people find it very tiring,"" she says. ""So make sure to give yourself enough time throughout the day to take breaks and unwind.""

Soumya Swaminathan told a news briefing in Geneva that the more countries that joined COVAX, a scheme designed to guarantee fast and equitable access globally to COVID-19 vaccines, the greater its chances of success.
More than 75 countries have expressed an interest in joining COVAX, which is co-led by the GAVI vaccines alliance, the WHO and the CEPI Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. Its aim is to deliver 2 billion doses of effective, approved COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021.

Some global health agencies are concerned about wealthier countries going it alone in the race for a coronavirus vaccine, striking deals with drugmakers to secure millions of doses of promising candidates for their own citizens.

1522,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 11:46AM ET</span>",COVID-19 sinks U.S. economy in second quarter; labor market struggling,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy contracted at its steepest pace since the Great Depression in the second quarter as the COVID-19 pandemic shattered consumer and business spending, and a nascent recovery is under threat from a resurgence in new cases of coronavirus.
The bulk of the historic plunge in gross domestic product reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday occurred in April when activity almost ground to an abrupt halt after restaurants, bars and factories among others were shuttered in mid-March to slow the spread of coronavirus.
The collapse in GDP and faltering recovery put pressure on the White House and Congress to agree on a second stimulus package. President Donald Trump, whose opinion poll numbers have tanked as he struggles to manage the pandemic, economic crisis and protests over racial injustice three months before the Nov. 3 election, said on Wednesday he was in no hurry.
""This is hard to swallow,"" said Jason Reed, finance professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business. ""Right now, the American economy is speeding toward a fiscal cliff. Not only do we need Americans to take serious action preventing the spread of the disease, but we also need Congress to agree on another stimulus package and quickly."" 
Gross domestic product collapsed at a 32.9% annualized rate last quarter, the deepest decline in output since the government started keeping records in 1947. The drop in GDP was more than triple the previous all-time decline of 10% in the second quarter of 1958. The economy contracted at a 5.0% pace in the first quarter. It fell into recession in February.
Click https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/GDP/jbyprkmjqve/index.html for a graphic on the GDP plunge
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP plunging at a 34.1% rate in the April-June quarter.
The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, which compiles the GDP report, attributed the tumble in output to measures taken in March and April in response to COVID-19, saying they ""led to rapid shifts in activity.""
Though activity picked up starting in May, momentum has slowed amid a resurgence in new cases of the respiratory illness, especially in the densely populated South and West regions where authorities in hard-hit areas are closing businesses again or pausing reopenings. That has tempered hopes of a sharp rebound in growth in the third quarter. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday acknowledged the slowdown in activity. The U.S. central bank kept interest rates near zero and pledged to continue pumping money into the economy.
Stocks on Wall Street opened lower. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
BROAD HISTORIC DECLINES
Economists say without the historic fiscal package of nearly $3 trillion, the economic contraction would have been deeper. The package offered companies help paying wages and gave millions of unemployed Americans a weekly $600 supplement, which expires on Saturday. Many companies have exhausted their loans.
This, together with the sky-rocketing coronavirus infections is keeping layoffs elevated. In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.434 million in the week ending July 25. A staggering 30.2 million Americans were receiving unemployment checks in the week ending July 11.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-third of the U.S. economy, plunged at a record 34.6% rate last quarter. That followed a 6.9% pace of decline in the January-March period. Major retailers including JC Penney (OTC:JCPNQ) and Neiman Marcus have filed for bankruptcy.
Business investment tumbled at a historic 27% rate. It was pulled down by spending on equipment, which collapsed at a 37.7% rate. Investment is equipment has now contracted for five straight quarters. Boeing (N:BA) reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Wednesday and slashed production on its widebody programs. 
The pandemic has also crushed oil prices, leading to deep cuts in shale oil production and layoffs. Spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration, shafts and wells plunged at a record 34.9% rate in the second quarter.
The housing market was not spared, with spending on homebuilding tumbling at 38.7% rate. But government spending rose at a 2.7% rate, thanks to the historic stimulus package. Spending by state and local governments, whose budgets have been decimated in the fight against coronavirus fell at a 5.6% rate. 

Disruptions to global trade depressed exports and imports. Though a smaller import bill helped to narrow the trade deficit and was positive for GDP, it cut inventories, leading to a drawdown of stocks by businesses that subtracted 3.98 percentage points from GDP.

(Reuters) - Congressional districts with the highest black populations received up to $13 billion dollars less in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funding than districts with the lowest percent of black residents, a new study shows.
The 10 congressional districts with the lowest black populations got over 64,000 more PPP loans than the 10 districts with the most black residents, analysis of federal data by advocacy group Accountable.US found. The predominately black districts got as much as $23 billion in funding as of July 20th compared with $36 billion for the non-black districts.
The $600 billion government stimulus program was meant to bail out small businesses that have been slammed by mandatory shutdowns to stem the coronavirus outbreak and by reduced spending by consumers. As Congress debates the details of a new round of stimulus, more entrepreneurs are considering shuttering permanently against an increasingly uncertain economic backdrop.
Black-owned small businesses, which are highly concentrated in retail, restaurants and other service industries most affected by shutdowns, are expected to shutter at twice the rate of small businesses overall.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top officials from President Donald Trump's administration planned more talks with congressional Republicans and Democrats on Thursday, despite flagging hopes of reaching an agreement to extend coronavirus aid before a Friday deadline.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said they would head to the Capitol for negotiations, even though hours of meetings so far have left deep divisions over how best to help the country recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Senate's Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said on Wednesday he still thought there could be some form of an agreement this week. ""Many things around here happen at the last minute,"" McConnell told PBS, adding that ""hope springs eternal.""
A $600-per-week supplemental unemployment benefit, a lifeline for tens of millions of Americans left jobless by the health crisis, expires on Friday. A federal moratorium that prevented evictions ended last Friday, leaving untold numbers of Americans at risk of losing their homes.
Congress has already passed aid packages totaling $3 trillion to alleviate the effects of the virus, which has killed 150,000 Americans.
The Democratic-led House of Representatives passed a plan, worth another $3 trillion, in May. But the Republican-led Senate refused to consider that bill.
Instead, Senate Republicans unveiled on Monday their own plan, reached with the Trump administration, with a $1 trillion price tag.
After meeting on Wednesday with the top two Democrats in Congress - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer - Mnuchin and Meadows said there were still deep divisions on a host of issues.

Those include whether to pass a temporary extension of the extended unemployment benefit, whether to provide aid to state and local governments and a Republican plan to prevent liability lawsuits.

1526,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 06:32AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday, July 30th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The U.S. publishes second-quarter GDP figures and weekly jobless claims. Germany's economy shrunk more than expected in the three months through June but its labor market is recovering. Big Tech reports after the bell, a day after emerging unscathed from a puffball hearing in Congress. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Samsung (KS:005930) stock both soar as the outlook improves for chipmakers. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, July 30th.
1. Big Tech earnings
A day after modestly playing down their importance to lawmakers, Big Tech CEOs get to parade what are set to be a bumper set of earnings after the closing bell.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet will all release their results, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in particular likely to book large increases in revenue from their Cloud-hosting businesses as the pandemic forces the real world to move into the virtual one at a faster pace.
Of more interest, arguably, will be developments in the advertising businesses of Alphabet and, especially, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The latter is facing a spreading boycott by advertisers over its failure to tackle disinformation and hate speech on its platform. Given the obvious read-across to Google’s YouTube platform, Facebook’s outlook will attract particular attention.
2. GDP, Jobless claims due as lawmakers haggle over unemployment benefit
The U.S. will confirm its worst quarterly economic performance since the Great Depression, with preliminary numbers for second-quarter gross domestic product. A rough analyst consensus suggests an annualized decline of around 34%, although the rebound in economic activity since May makes the annualized number even more meaningless than it usually is.
There are also jobless claims data due for last week. Seasonal factors are expected to push initial jobless claims up to 1.45 million from 1.415 million the week before. Continuing jobless claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, are expected to remain essentially unchanged at 16.20 million.
The data come only two days before the existing enhancements to unemployment benefits under the CARES Act are set to expire. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said on Wednesday that Congressional Republicans and Democrats are “nowhere close to a deal,” adding that “enhanced unemployment provisions will expire.”
3. Stocks set to open lower
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower, giving up most of the gains they made on Wednesday after reassurances of continued support from the Federal Reserve (and hints of even more support later this year).
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the US 30 Futures contract was down 230 points or 0.9%, while the US 500 Futures contract was down 0.9% and the US Tech 100 Futures contract was down 1.0%
In addition to the big four tech companies, there will also be earnings before the opening from Mastercard and consumer giant Procter & Gamble, Comcast,  Eli Lilly and United Parcel Service.
Anheuser Busch InBev already released its earnings in Europe, showing a surprise jump in beer sales, while Nestle also topped expectations. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), however, swung to an operating loss and cut its dividend.
4. German data shock weighs on Europe
Germany’s economy shrunk by more than expected in the second quarter, according to preliminary data released by Destatis.
Quarterly output fell an estimated 10.1%, more than the 9% consensus forecast. The data may be subject to considerable revisions, given that Germany hasn’t published June data for either retail sales, industrial production or exports yet.
On the brighter side, unemployment in Europe’s largest economy fell by a seasonally-adjusted 18,000 in July.
Even so, the news weighed on the local stock market, and throughout Europe. The Dax fell 2.3%, while the EUR/USD retreated 0.3% from a two-year high to $1.1755.
5. Chipmakers upbeat as Qualcomm signs Huawei peace deal
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock is set for a strong opening after rising 12% in after-hours trading on Wednesday on the back of settling its drawn-out dispute with Huawei. The company will receive a $1.8 billion lump sum for previously unpaid licensing fees.
More intriguingly, Qualcomm said it’s also signed a long-term sales deal with the Chinese giant, one that may yet be held hostage by the downturn in U.S.-China relations.
Separately, a report by Canalys suggested that Huawei became the world’s top-selling mobile phone maker in the first half of 2020, a development largely due to the fact that its heavily Chinese-weighted sales recovered faster than Apple’s or Samsung’s.
Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), for its part, reported a 7.2% increase in quarterly profit due to a surge in demand for its chips since the pandemic erupted. It expects demand for its mobile devices and electronics to recover in the rest of 2020.

1528,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",Japan panel puts tentative end to Abenomics boom in 2018,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A panel of seven private Japanese economists tentatively declared the economy ended its second-longest boom and entered ""recession"" in late 2018, suggesting it was struggling long before its more recent coronavirus slump.
While recession is technically defined as two straight quarters of economic contraction, in Japan, the government uses the term to refer to the end of boom-and-bust cycles, which is determined by a Cabinet Office panel of economists.
The panel said on Thursday Japan's most recent growth cycle started in December 2012, when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe swept to power with a pledge to reboot the economy with aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus.
""We agreed it was appropriate to set October 2018 as the tentative peak of the economy, which was shown by historical diffusion indexes,"" Hiroshi Yoshikawa, Rissho University professor who chairs the panel, told reporters after its meeting. 
That likely October 2018 peak snapped the growth cycle at 71 consecutive months - when an intensifying Sino-U.S. trade war damaged Japan's exports and factory output. That will likely trigger calls for virus stimulus on top of $2.2 trillion implemented, some analysts say.
""The economy likely hit the bottom in May providing that the second wave of infections remains limited,"" said Toru Suehiro, senior market economist at Mizuho Securities. 
""However, given the uncertain outlook, the jobs-to-applicants ratio may stay stagnant, which could delay the timing of bottoming out.""
Technically, Japan dipped into recession once during that 71-month expansion, in the second half of 2015.
It more recently slid into another technical recession in the six months to March 2020, which is expected to have deepened in the June quarter as the coronavirus devastated demand.
Economists and policymakers see the economy emerging from its worst postwar downturn and getting back on track for a modest recovery.
The panel's latest view means the growth cycle fuelled by Abe's ""Abenomics"" policies stopped a little short of a record post-war expansion phase that lasted for 73 months through February 2008.

The U.S. economy ended its longest expansion in history in February and entered recession due to the pandemic, a private sector research group said last month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan sharply downgraded its gross domestic product forecasts for this fiscal year, expecting the world's third-largest economy to suffer its biggest contraction in over two decades amid the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.
The government expects the economy to shrink 4.5% this fiscal year to March 2021 compared with January's forecast for 1.4% growth. That would be the biggest contraction since comparable data became available in 1994.
The economy could contract about 5% if there is a second large-scale coronavirus outbreak overseas, according to the government, which unusually gave forecasts for various scenarios mirroring what some international organizations have done.
Japan's economy is expected to suffer a sharp contraction in the second quarter as the coronavirus hit global growth and the nation's state of emergency forced people to stay home and businesses to close.
The dismal forecasts underscore policymakers' concerns about a deep economic recession, but also raises the prospect of more government support, after it already delivered $2.2 trillion worth of stimulus this year.
The economy is expected to rebound with a 3.4% growth in the next fiscal year ending March 2022, according to the latest estimates.
Private sector economists in a Reuters poll expected Japan's economy to contract by a steeper 5.3% this fiscal year and expand 3.3% next fiscal year. [ECILT/JP]
Under the baseline scenario, consumer prices, including volatile fresh food and energy costs, are forecast to fall 0.3%this fiscal year - far below the Bank of Japan's 2% inflation target - and only rebound 0.5% in the next fiscal year.
The unemployment rate meanwhile is seen rising 3.2% this fiscal year, as the coronavirus outbreak hits firms, and to ease to 2.7% in the fiscal year ending March 2022.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's finance ministry on Thursday slashed its 2020 economic forecast to a record 8.5% contraction in gross domestic product from the 2.8% growth it projected in January, due to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.
The ministry also cut its 2020 estimate for exports, a key driver of growth, to a fall of 11.0% from an earlier 1.0% rise, Lavaron Sangsnit, head of its fiscal policy office, told a news conference.
The ministry expected the economy to have hit bottom in the second quarter with double-digit shrinkage before gradually recovering, he said.
""A recovery is likely to be a check-mark shaped,"" he said.
The government has introduced billions of dollars of stimulus packages to mitigate the fallout of the outbreak on vital tourism and domestic activity.
The ministry plans additional measures to boost consumption to be proposed to a new finance minister, Lavaron said
""The government still has room to help the economy,"" he added.
Banking executive Predee Daochai is expected to be the next finance minister in a new cabinet expected to be completed by mid-August.
For 2021, Southeast Asia's second-largest economy is expected to expand 4%-5%, with exports rising 5%, Lavaron said.
Next year's major growth driver will be foreign tourist numbers, which are expected at 15-16 million after only 6.8 million projected for this year, he said. 

In 2019, Thailand had a record 39.8 million foreign tourists whose spending accounted for 11.4% of GDP.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia decided this week to fast track approvals for a A$22 billion ($16 billion) project to supply solar power to Singapore via the world's longest subsea high voltage cable, a move to boost recovery from the coronavirus crisis.
The Australia-ASEAN Power Link project, run by Singapore-based Sun Cable, envisions a 10 gigawatt solar farm and energy storage facility of up to 30 GWh in the Northern Territory, with a 4,500-km (2,800-mile) link to Singapore and eventually Indonesia.
Sun Cable Chief Executive David Griffin said on Thursday the government's granting of major project status for AAPL would make the approvals process for the project ""much easier"" and could help it beat its late-2023 target for securing financing.
""We're trying very hard to bring forward at least elements of the project,"" Griffin told Reuters.
The company wants to build an early phase of the big battery it plans in Darwin and aims to build a factory in Darwin next year to manufacture Maverick solar modules, which it will eventually use at the giant proposed solar farm, he said.
Maverick is a product made by private Australian firm 5B, which on Thursday completed a A$12 million capital raising, backed by U.S. power company AES Corp (N:AES).
Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the AAPL project was strategically important for Australia, the world's top coal and liquefied natural gas exporter, to remain a major energy exporter, and for its potential to create hundreds of jobs.
""It's a strong statement to all Australians that despite the immediate challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic...industry is still investing in opportunities that will drive our economic recovery and create much needed jobs,"" he said in a statement.
AAPL won major project status a year ago from the Northern Territory.
""We've made massive progress over the last 12 months, but we do still have a long way to go,"" Griffin said.

""We think it is extremely regrettable that South Korea has not honoured our agreement to resolve the matter through dialogue and communication,"" Mitsuhiro Fukuyama, director of the International Legal Affairs Office at Japan's trade ministry, said. 
""Under present situation, it is difficult to have policy dialogue with South Korea.""
Bilateral relations deteriorated after South Korea's Supreme Court in 2018 ordered two Japanese companies to compensate wartime workers in a ruling that Tokyo said violated international law. Japan says the issue of compensation was settled under a 1965 treaty.
Following the ruling, the Japanese government said in July last year it would stop preferential treatment for shipments to South Korea of three materials whose production it dominates and which are used by firms such as Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd (KS:005930).
Curbs on two of the materials - hydrogen fluoride, used as an etching gas in the chipmaking process and fluorinated polyimides, used in smartphone displays - remain in place and exporters need to gain permission for each shipment, which takes around 90 days.
Seoul, which resumed its WTO complaint in June after talks stalled, plans to show Japan's export restriction measures are ""arbitrary and discriminatory"" and is urging Tokyo to withdraw the measures as soon as possible.
It usually takes 10 to 13 months for the WTO dispute settlement body to make a final decision, Seoul said. 

Japan also this week condemned a statue in South Korea that appears to depict Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, kneeling and bowing to a seated ""comfort woman,"" a euphemism for women forced to work in Japan's wartime brothels.

1534,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 02:36AM ET</span>",Iran struggles to buy food in a world wary of touching its money,"By Jonathan Saul, Ana Mano and Joori Roh
LONDON/SAO PAULO/SEOUL (Reuters) - Iran, creaking under the impact of U.S. sanctions, a collapse in oil sales and a severe COVID-19 epidemic, is scrambling to buy food and medicine to avoid a supply crunch. But it's a struggle.
Despite such supplies being exempt from sanctions, banks and governments are reluctant to transfer or take Iranian money because they fear unwittingly breaching the complex U.S. restrictions, according to five trade and finance sources. 
An approved trade channel launched by the Swiss government, and backed by Washington - the Swiss Humanitarian Trade Agreement (SHTA) - went live in February after over a year of work to facilitate such Iranian purchases from Swiss companies.
Yet Iran's central bank (CBI) has been unable to transfer the billions of dollars worth of oil export cash it had built up between 2016 and 2018 to bank accounts working with the SHTA, the five sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
That money was accumulated in bank accounts in countries that Iran sold oil to, especially in Asia, with its biggest customers including South Korea and Japan, in the years after Iran signed the nuclear accord with world powers, but before the Trump administration withdrew and reimposed sanctions in 2018.
The funds were frozen when the sanctions, which target the CBI as well as dollar transactions with Iranian entities, were reintroduced. As a result, international banks and their governments - whom they seek clearance from - are wary of allowing funds to be released without specific authorisation from Washington for each transfer, the sources said.
The blockage, according to the sources, illustrates how the complexity of U.S. sanctions has made many banks, companies and countries wary of doing any business with Iran, even when exemptions exist, because breaches can involve huge financial penalties and being effectively shut out of the crucial U.S. financial system.
The impact has also been felt in other areas, with Reuters previously reporting many foreign shipping companies and insurers are unwilling to provide vessels or cover for voyages, even for approved commerce.
SOUTH KOREA, JAPAN
South Korean and Japanese authorities have declined cash transfers to Switzerland by the CBI without specific U.S. approval, according to the sources, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The South Korean foreign ministry confirmed this.
""Under the current U.S. sanctions, returning the money in cash is impossible,"" an official told Reuters. ""Any permission regarding the funds need to be strictly authorized by the U.S.""
The foreign ministry official said Seoul had ""discussed the Swiss route as another possible way of clearance (of funds)"" but added that the ""U.S. hasn't been positive about such proposals"".
It is unclear why the United States might not have given specific approval for those transactions. 
A Japanese finance ministry official declined to comment and referred the matter to Iranian authorities.
The CBI did not respond to requests for comment. 
When asked whether such transfers of funds were permitted and whether it would give specific authorisations, a U.S. Treasury spokesperson said the United States was committed to the delivery of humanitarian goods and services to the Iranian people.
Non U.S. nationals could engage in the export or re-export of food, agricultural products, medicine, and medical devices to Iran outside of U.S. jurisdiction without additional authorization provided transactions involving the CBI were consistent with U.S. guidance, the spokesperson added. 
A State Department spokesperson said the United States remained committed to the success of the SHTA.
""It has never been, nor is it now, U.S. policy to target humanitarian trade with Iran,"" it added.
ONE SWISS DEAL DONE
Switzerland's government said on Monday that a Swiss pharmaceutical company had completed the first transaction under the new humanitarian trade channel with Iran, adding more transactions would follow. 
The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) told Reuters that the SHTA needed ""regular transfers of Iranian funds from abroad for its functioning"", adding that U.S. authorities had given assurances that they would support such transfers. 
""We are in talks with the USA and other partners on this matter. However, we cannot provide information on individual transfers,"" SECO said, without providing further details.
SECO also did not comment on how the first confirmed transaction was funded. 
An Iranian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tehran had been in contact with countries where it had funds to try to transfer the money under the Swiss initiative. 
""These countries have approached the U.S. to secure its approval for such a transfer, but to no avail,"" the official said.
Swiss bank BCP is the only financial institution that has committed to the SHTA so far and agreed to receive Iranian funds under the scheme, the sources said. 
BCP did not respond to requests for comment.
The sources said major international trading houses were also ready to supply Iran with agricultural commodities under the scheme, but only when they were certain transactions were free of any sanctions risk.
""The big trading houses will only work inside a formal U.S.-approved payment system,"" one European grain trader said.
BRAZILIAN CORN CLOG
Adding to Iran's food-supply woes, corn imports from key supplier Brazil have slumped. Iran was Brazil's second-biggest buyer of corn in 2019, but in January to June its imports from the country slid to around 339,000 tonnes from 2.3 million tonnes a year ago, according to Brazilian government data.
Tehran is facing increased competition in Brazil's corn market from other buyers especially Taiwan. Brazilian sellers are also struggling to find international banks willing to process the transactions because of perceived sanctions risk, according to seven Brazilian trade and finance sources.
The traders have sought to use small local banks to clear Iran-related transactions, the people said. They have also sought to use the euro to avoid dollar transactions that would be flagged to the U.S. Treasury, they added. 
Iran pays $10 per tonne more than other buyers to compensate for payment and logistical challenges, the Brazilian trade sources said. 
""Because of the hostile policies of the United States, we have to cut down imports,"" said Mehdi Ansari, head of Iran-based grain trader Tejari Ansari Group. 
The U.S. Treasury declined to comment when asked about the drop in Brazilian corn sales to Iran.
Iranian buyers have made around 600,000 tonnes worth of advanced corn purchases from Brazil this month for the second half of the year, with payments expected to be worked out once cargoes sail, trade sources said. Sellers could divert vessels to other buyers, however, if Iran cannot pay.
    Brazilian traders are also using barter deals, for example taking Iranian urea to be used as fertilizer in exchange for corn, the sources said.
Carlos Millnitz, CEO of Brazilian chemical company Eleva Química, told Reuters such deals did not breach sanctions as no money was exchanged, but ""make the corn more expensive for Iran"". 

He added, however, that his company was avoiding Iranian-flagged ships for barter exchanges after two such vessels were stranded for weeks at a Brazilian port last year when state-run oil firm Petrobras refused to refuel them due to U.S. sanctions.

Francois Villeroy de Galhau told Paris Match magazine that President Emmanuel Macron's government must spend wisely to rebuild trust in the economy. Household and private sector confidence were the key to a relatively swift recovery, he said.
""Our forecasts predict a 10% fall in GDP this year: it may be a little better, with a strong rebound afterwards to hopefully regain a pre-COVID level of activity at the start of 2022,"" Villeroy said in the interview published on Thursday.
The government availed a crisis package worth 137 billion euros, or more than 6% of gross domestic product, to cushion the immediate impact of the epidemic and also committed to guarantee 300 billion euros in bank loans to help keep firms afloat.
After the summer break, it will present a 100 billion euro stimulus package to propel the recovery. Spending decisions would need to be intelligent, Villeroy said.
""Public money is not unlimited,"" he said. The 'whatever it takes' must progressively give way to the 'when it is needed'."" 
French households would be sitting on a 100 billion-euro pool of savings by the end of the year. But for that money to filter into the economy, it was essential for the government to guarantee taxes would not be raised, or indeed cut as it could not afford to do so.

Underscoring the difficulties ahead, consumer confidence unexpectedly dropped in July, as the number of people who considered now a good time to save increased amid a flare up in COVID-19 infections.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 11:45PM ET</span>",Former Fed economist accuses profession and central bank of sexism,"By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - A searing blog by a former Federal Reserve economist accused the economics profession generally, and the Fed in particular, of discrimination against her and other women, prompting the central bank's head - Jerome Powell - to say that women had experienced unfair treatment ""for far too long.""
""Everyone who is privileged enough to hold a PhD in economics should reflect on our toxic culture,"" Claudia Sahm, who is now the director of macroeconomic policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, wrote in a blog post published Wednesday. ""Economics is a disgrace. The lack of diversity and inclusion degrades our knowledge and policy advice.""
In the blog post, Sahm singled out several prominent male economists for their interactions with her or remarks on gender more broadly. Sahm detailed incidents in which she said male colleagues at the Fed and male economists elsewhere questioned her expertise and demeaned her work. She also said colleagues did not inform her of her rights to file a formal complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission about the harassment she said she experienced.
The Federal Reserve did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Powell was asked about it during his news conference on Wednesday following the central bank's latest policy meeting.
Powell said he had not read the blog, but acknowledged the U.S. central bank could do more and should do more to establish a diverse and inclusive workforce, and that doing so was a high priority for the Fed.
""It's fair to acknowledge that there's been a lot of pain and injustice and unfair treatment that women have experienced in the workplace, not just among economists,"" Powell said. ""And at the Fed it's been going on for far too long.""
A survey released last year by the American Economic Association found that 30% of female economists said they had been discriminated against in the field, compared to 12% of male economists.
While the federal government hires more women and minority economists than academia, the pace at which they are being hired remains slow, according to a study from the Brookings Institution published last September.
The share of female economists at the Federal Reserve, which includes its headquarters and 12 regional Feds, was unchanged at 24% of the workforce between 2013 and 2018, the study showed. The share of minority economists has risen to 25% from 22% in 2013.
Sahm, who also served on former President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, is the author of an eponymous rule that can help determine the start of a recession. The Sahm Rule finds that the economy has just or is about to enter a period of contraction when the three-month average of the unemployment rate rises half a percentage point above the low of the previous year.
In the post, Sahm wrote about her struggles with mental illness and bipolar disorder and called on universities, the government and lead economists to provide a more welcoming and respectful environment for women and minorities.

""Efforts to change our culture are cheap talk if we do not act,"" she wrote. ""Instead of a victory lap, we should be ashamed of the lack of progress and the sloppy implementation.""

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 11:10PM ET</span>",U.S. renters owe $21.5 billion in back rent; Republicans offer no eviction relief,"By Michelle Conlin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than $21.5 billion in past-due rent is looming over Americans struggling to make ends meet, global advisory firm Stout, Risius and Ross estimated on Wednesday, as Republicans and Democrats fight over a new COVID-19 relief package. 
Senate Republicans this week proposed a new plan that would not reinstate the recently-lapsed federal eviction ban, which carried a stay for rent due for one-third of renters. Adding to the strain, enhanced $600 weekly federal unemployment benefits are set to evaporate this Friday.
Without a solution soon, the likely result ""will be a staggering surge in homelessness unlike anything we have seen,"" said John Pollock, a Public Justice Center attorney and coordinator of the National Coalition for a Civil Right to Counsel (NCCRC), which helped develop the eviction tracking tool with Stout, Risius and Ross.
The unprecedented amount of back rent is not a macro-economic game changer, said Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi. But for renters, ""it's catastrophic. Very few people will be able to pay this back,"" he said.
A debt spiral could haunt displaced tenants ""for a lifetime,"" he added.
Over the spring and early summer, as unemployment surged to levels unseen since the aftermath of the 1930s Great Depression, a patchwork of federal, state and local eviction bans kept renters in their homes.
On Friday, the eviction ban that covered the third of renters in buildings with mortgages backed by the federal government lapsed. The rent deferred over four months is now due, as is all the rent where local and state moratoria on evictions have also ended.
When rent goes missing over such an extended period, the low-end of the market becomes a house of cards and ""it starts to fall down,"" said Emily Benfer, who co-created the COVID-19 Housing Policy Scorecard at Princeton University's Eviction Lab, a national research center on evictions.
""Risk of eviction increases, risk of foreclosure and bankruptcy follows, property taxes go unpaid leaving communities and schools under-resourced,"" said Benfer, a visiting law professor at Wake Forest University.
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed a measure in May that would have extended the enhanced jobless aid through January and allocated $100 billion for rental assistance. It would also have extended the federal ban on evictions for up to one year.
The Republican-controlled Senate package unveiled Monday focuses on getting kids back in school, workers back to work and winning the fight against the virus, the Office of the Senate Majority Leader said in a statement.
It proposes cutting the enhanced unemployment assistance to $200 a week, and does not mention housing, evictions, or reinstating the eviction ban.
The Senate Republican Communications Center did not respond to requests for comment.
The Senate Banking Committee, which oversees housing, cited a statement by Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) on Tuesday.
""I can't answer that yet,"" he told reporters when asked about an extension of the eviction moratorium. ""There will be something, I hope, dealing with rental assistance.""
An avalanche of filings are hitting eviction courts nationwide, as hearings ramp up again online, in courtrooms that require social distancing, and even at the Columbus, Ohio convention center. In July alone, 21% of renters paid no rent, according to research firm Apartment List.

Stout and the NCCRC analyzed census survey results and income data to create their eviction tracker, which uploads data weekly. Of the 44 million U.S. renter households, 17.3 million are unable to pay rent and risk eviction, the tracker estimates.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 09:30PM ET</span>",China needs 'explosive' buying to meet U.S. farm import target,"By Hallie Gu and Karl Plume
BEIJING/CHICAGO (Reuters) - With nearly seven months gone, an ambitious $36.5 billion target for Chinese imports of U.S. farm goods this year may not be quite out of reach, but it's looking like a big, big stretch.
By end-May, imports were running behind 2017 levels - rather than 50% ahead as needed - and while orders for China's main farm import, soybeans, have started to pick up, scorching levels of buying would be needed to hit the mark.
Add in a rapid deterioration in U.S.-China relations, an upcoming U.S. election, a global pandemic and questions over just how much soybeans China actually needs, and farmers and analysts say it may be a stretch too far.
""It just doesn't seem likely to me,"" said John Payne, senior futures & options broker with Daniels Trading in Chicago. ""If the global economy was more normal then maybe, but you have this whole COVID problem."" 
Beijing and Washington sealed their Phase 1 trade deal in January after two years of acrimony and a steep slump in imports by one of the biggest buyers of U.S. agricultural goods.
Analysts at the time expressed reservations about the farm goods target, which is a quarter above 2013's all-time high of $29 billion.
Still, Chinese buyers stepped up purchases this year of a range of farm imports, sealing record deals in corn and meat imports, prompting some optimism.
""If I were to grade them today, we went from a C- to a B, and if it continues maybe we can start to see higher levels. But it needs to be a continual, ongoing affair,"" said Dan Basse, president of AgResource Co in Chicago.
EYES ON SOY
The chances of meeting the target will be clear in the next few months. Soybeans typically account for about half of China's U.S. farm imports and the vast bulk of buying comes in the last three months of the year when supplies from top grower Brazil dry up.
After a slow start, Chinese importers booked more than $2.5 billion in U.S. soy purchases in just the past eight weeks.
""We may be on the verge of really beginning to ramp up sales to China. I think you're going to start seeing these chunks of soybean sales happening pretty soon because Brazil's getting close to sold out,"" said John Baize, president of consultancy John C. Baize & Associates. 
It's unclear, however, whether China will sustain its appetite over the next five months after its crushers earlier snapped up record volumes from Brazil. 
Demand will also depend on China's recovery from a disease that killed hundreds of millions of pigs, reducing the need for feed.
For soybeans to make up half of the $36.5 billion target, buyers would have to take some $2.8 billion a month from July to December, according to Reuters calculations.
This pace of monthly buying has never been sustained for more than two straight months and only then during the fourth quarter of the year, most recently in 2016.
Falling commodity prices due to the coronavirus pandemic present an added difficulty, with the deal tied squarely to the value of imports. Soybean prices this year have averaged around 10% less than in 2016.
OTHER IMPORTS 
Trade in other products, meanwhile, may find it hard to hold their early trajectory.
Chinese buyers bought more than $500 million of corn in the first half of July, but importers are thought to have nearly filled their import quotas and the country's own crop will be ready for harvest from September.
China also spent record amounts on meat through May, including over $1.2 billion on pork, according to USDA data, but overall spending on meat is relatively small.
In total, China's American farm purchases amounted to $6 billion through May - the latest data available - up just 9.1% from the same period in 2019 and 31% below 2017's level.
The sales have disappointed U.S. farmers hoping for a Chinese buying bonanza.
""It's been rocky, to say the least,"" said North Dakota farmer Paul Sproule. ""They have been making some buys lately, which we appreciate. But with closing down the consulates and the issues with Hong Kong, relations are only getting worse.""
In all, a daunting figure of roughly $25 billion of purchases will be needed for the second six months of the year, according to Reuters calculations.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture and office of the U.S. Trade Representative did not respond to requests for comment. China's Ministry of Commerce also did not respond to a faxed request for comment.
POLITICAL WILL
China may not violate the deal if it misses the target due to the impact of coronavirus. The deal grants flexibility in the event of ""a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event.""
At the same time, politics will come into play.
With bilateral relations in turmoil, China may want to avoid making itself a bigger target for criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump during the U.S. election campaign by failing to make big agricultural purchases.
The final volumes of China's soybean purchases will likely depend on whether or not Beijing chooses to replenish government stockpiles.
Overall, China normally requires 7-8 million tonnes a month of soybeans, noted a soy crusher in northeastern China.
""It would be a separate story if the beans go into state reserves,"" he said.
China-based sources said China will want to avoid the reputational damage of not meeting its commitments if possible.
""We will bite our teeth and implement the trade deal. Otherwise, we don't look good on the international stage,"" said a trading manager with a state-run firm.
""But we would need to buy in an explosive way.""

1539,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 08:40PM ET</span>","Exclusive: White House to lure U.S. firms to Latam from Asia in nearshoring drive, senior adviser says","By Andrea Shalal and Cassandra Garrison
WASHINGTON/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The Trump administration is readying a new initiative that would use financial incentives to encourage U.S. firms to move production facilities out of Asia and into the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean, a senior White House adviser said on Wednesday.
The project could bring $30 billion to $50 billion in U.S. investment back to the Americas, Mauricio Claver-Carone told Reuters in an interview, adding that infrastructure, energy and transportation could be the first potential areas of focus.
""We're essentially creating a 'Back to the Americas' initiative,"" he said. That would include both returning some facilities outsourced to China back to the United States and basing others in Latin America and the Caribbean in a drive for more so-called nearshoring, Claver-Carone said.
He gave no details about the scope of possible incentives, but pointed to the administration's use of a $765 million loan to encourage Eastman Kodak Co (N:KODK) to produce pharmaceutical ingredients in the United States to help fight the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. President Donald Trump has made ""Buy America"" policies a centerpiece of his administration since taking office in 2017, with those efforts accelerating sharply since the turmoil created by the pandemic.
The United States and China signed a trade deal in January, but tensions have mounted in recent months over Beijing's handling of the outbreak, a national security law limiting the autonomy of Hong Kong, and other issues.
Claver-Carone said the administration had already been working with countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to help them attract U.S. investors, but the pandemic helped convince U.S. companies it was time to get on board. He did not name any companies.
He said the outbreak had clearly demonstrated the advantages of having suppliers based closer to the United States than in Asia.
The initiative would not focus on cheap labor costs, but would build on provisions aimed at protecting workers that were included in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement that entered into force in July, he added.
Claver-Carone also said there needed to be an improvement in transparency over Chinese lending in Latin America.
He said Ecuador in particular was ""not being able to advance and move forward and kind of unshackle itself from that unfair, over-collateralized debt to China.""
Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno has sought to renegotiate the terms of its debt to China, which totaled $6.5 billion in 2018.
China invests heavily in Latin America and has been responsible for more than $40 billion in lending to the region since 2015, according to Inter-American Dialogue data.
The United States wants to ""collaborate"" with China to ensure its lending practices in the region are more transparent, said Claver-Carone, echoing a push by the World Bank.
The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
'OVERWHELMING SUPPORT'
If he wins a September election, Claver-Carone would be the first U.S. candidate to head the Washington-based Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), Latin America's principal development finance institution.
His candidacy has prompted push-back from some Latin American countries and former leaders, including publicly-shared letters signed by former presidents and ministers stating their opposition.
Claver-Carone, who as a top Latin American adviser for Trump has played a key role pushing for punitive measures against socialist-run Venezuela and Cuba, said he had ""overwhelming support"" from countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador.
He said 15 countries in the region had publicly supported him for the IDB job and six others, which he declined to name, had privately expressed their backing.

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 06:35PM ET</span>",Fed chief says coronavirus surge slowing U.S. economic recovery,"By Ann Saphir and Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - The surge in U.S. coronavirus cases is beginning to weigh on economic activity, the head of the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday, and he promised the U.S. central bank would ""do what we can, and for as long as it takes,"" to limit damage and boost growth.
""It looks like the data are pointing to a slowing in the pace of the recovery,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference, pointing to an apparent pullback by consumers and a slowdown in the rehiring of furloughed workers, particularly by small businesses.
The United States, he said, ""has entered a new phase in containing the virus, which is essential to protect both our health and our economy.""
Powell's comments, made via videoconference after the Fed announced its policy decision to leave interest rates near zero, suggest dimming hopes for a quick economic rebound. Coronavirus infections have exploded in a number of Southern and Southwestern states in recent weeks, and some states have paused or rolled back reopening measures.
The Fed's policy statement, released at the close of its two-day meeting, directly tied the economic recovery to resolution of a health crisis whose direction remains much in doubt. More than 150,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
""The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus,"" the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said.
In his news conference, Powell elaborated on just how much remained unclear about the direction of the world's largest economy. Fiscal programs that he credits with sustaining consumer spending in recent weeks are about to expire, with debate still under way in Congress over what, if anything, will take their place.
The virus is moving so fast that policymakers are taking cues about the economy from real-time flows of data from firms that track people's movements through cellphones, for example, or provide signals about hiring, Powell said.
""That data show that on balance ... the pace of the recovery looks like it has slowed since cases began that spike,"" he said. ""I want to stress,"" he added, ""it’s too early to say both how large that is and how sustained that is.""
The Fed held policy largely steady, with key decisions likely to come this fall after it is clearer where the health crisis is heading and just what action Congress takes to support struggling businesses and unemployed workers.
Fed policymakers repeated a pledge to use their ""full range of tools"" to support the economy and keep interest rates near zero for as long as it takes to recover from the epidemic.
All FOMC members voted to leave the target range for short-term rates between 0% and 0.25%, where it has been since March 15 when the virus was beginning to hit the nation. 
""We are not even thinking about thinking about thinking about raising rates,"" Powell said, noting the economic recovery will take a long time because millions of people working in heavily affected industries like hotels or restaurants won't have jobs to go back to any time soon. ""We are in this until we are well through it."" 
U.S. stocks added to gains after the Fed's statement, while longer-term U.S. Treasury yields moved slightly higher. The dollar fell to a two-year low against a basket of currencies.
""The most notable thing is the statement that the path of the economy will depend on COVID-19. The Fed is putting health again front and center in its statement, which is impactful and meaningful,"" said Nela Richardson, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. 
""It's a bit ominous, to be frank. ... That sentence shows the primacy of COVID-19 in their outlook and the uncertainty of their outlook because of it,"" Richardson said.
NO CHANGE FOR NOW
If official economic data backs up early indications of a decline in growth, the Fed could ease policy further, Powell signaled, including by potentially promising no changes to interest rates until unemployment and inflation rates meet explicit benchmarks. 
A government report due out Thursday is expected to show a record 34% drop in annualized economic output last quarter.
Since the Fed's last policy meeting in June, the epidemic has intensified, with an average of around 65,000 new cases detected each day, about three times the pace of mid-June.
Job growth, which had been unexpectedly strong in May and June, now appears to be slowing and consumer confidence has taken a hit.
Government aid that kept millions of unemployed Americans spending will drop sharply at the end of this week unless Congress agrees on a new relief package, with Republicans and Democrats so far not able to bridge their differences.
Small businesses, a mainstay of the U.S. economy, are increasingly facing a breaking point as government grants run dry and payments come due.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three key U.S. House of Representatives Democrats on Wednesday asked the Treasury Department to halt government assistance to a dozen airport contractors that have laid off more than 9,000 workers.
The lawmakers found that more than $728 million in federal funds went to these companies even though the assistance was meant to keep workers on the payroll. The U.S. Treasury did not immediately comment.
Representatives Peter DeFazio, who chairs the Transportation Committee, Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT), chair of the Financial Services Committee, and James Clyburn, chair of the select subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, wrote Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and four companies receiving assistance.
Congress in March approved $32 billion in payroll support for the aviation industry, including $3 billion for contractors like caterers and airplane cleaners. The lawmakers noted that under the law, companies receiving funds are not to conduct involuntary furloughs or reduce pay rates through September.
One company, Gate Gourmet, is expected to receive $171 million in Treasury funds but has laid off more than 3,500 workers since March, the letter said.
A spokeswoman for Gategroup, Gate Gourmet's parent company, said that to ""ensure the long-term sustainability of our business in the U.S., layoffs and furloughs were necessary during these unprecedented times."" She said the company is committed to meeting its obligations under the law.
Swissport USA, slated to receive $170.4 million in Payroll Support Program funds, announced layoffs of over 2,800 workers before finalizing its Treasury agreement, the lawmakers said.
Swissport said in a statement it ""believes it is currently fully-compliant with the terms"" of its support, adding: ""We look forward to working cooperatively with the relevant committees.""
Major aviation unions have sought a new round of payroll assistance from Congress to keep workers on the payroll through March 31 because of the significant downturn in travel demand.

BlackRock, which manages about $7 trillion in assets, was hired by the Fed in March to steer tens of billions of dollars in bond purchases as part of the U.S. central bank's efforts to stabilize the bond market amid the economic turmoil caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
BlackRock's own ETFs accounted for a large share of corporate bond ETFs it bought on behalf of the Fed as part of the central bank's relief program. BlackRock waived asset management fees on ETFs purchased on behalf of the Fed.
""BlackRock is just our agent,"" Powell said at his virtual news conference following the close of the Fed's two-day meeting, in response to a reporter's question on the handling of potential conflicts of interests. ""We make the policy decisions in conjunction with our colleagues and they just execute our plans.""
""I think their conflicts are managed extremely carefully in the contractual arrangement that we have with them,"" Powell said.
BlackRock, which in the past has said it is acting as a fiduciary to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and will execute the mandate at the sole discretion of the bank, had nothing to add to Powell's comments, a BlackRock spokesman said. 
Powell's public calendar shows he has had four phone conversations with BlackRock's chief executive, Larry Fink, since March. 
Fink ""generally checks in to find out whether we are OK with the quality of the service that BlackRock is providing,"" Powell said. ""He's typically trying to make sure that we are getting good service from the company."" 

BlackRock's fees for its role in assisting the Fed with its purchases of commercial mortgage-backed securities are capped at $8 million a year, according to details released in March.

The bill, facing tense negotiations in the Senate before multiple provisions aimed at helping Americans stave off financial losses amid the coronavirus pandemic expire on Friday, is on shaky ground with the White House at odds with both Democrats and Trump's own Republicans, who control the chamber.
Trump at first did not directly answer a question about whether he would drop his demand for $1.8 billion to fund a new FBI headquarters in downtown Washington one block from Trump International Hotel. He later said the provision ""should stay."" 
""Republicans should go back to school and learn,"" he told reporters at the White House. ""I'm very good at real estate.""
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell earlier this week referred questions on the provision to the White House. Some Democratic lawmakers have balked at its inclusion. 
The Trump administration's abrupt reversal of a years-long plan to relocate the FBI's main office from the heart of the nation's capital to the surrounding suburbs has drawn scrutiny since Trump scuttled the move in late 2017. 
Democrats and other critics have accused Trump of seeking to prevent the sale of the site to a private developer and possible competitor. The matter is currently under review by the Department of Justice.
Trump, who still owns his company but has said his sons run its day-to-day operations, became disqualified from buying the FBI site when he became president in 2017.

""The funding rider for FBI's HQ is a big deal,"" Walter Shaub, the former head of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, tweeted, adding that it ""reinforced suspicion Trump canceled the long-planned HQ move to prevent competition from moving in across the street from his hotel.""

The Fed has already implemented a limited measure, temporarily removing holdings of Treasuries from the calculation.
Many regulators around the world have enacted leverage relief for their banks, from Switzerland and Japan to Canada and the euro region, Powell said.
“We would want it to be explicitly temporary,” the Fed chief said of any further U.S. move. “In other words, this will not be a permanent change in capital standards.”
Powell also said the Fed is sending a fresh round of stress-test scenarios to banks, taking account of the coronavirus hit to the economy.
“We used a provision that says we can say there’s been a material change, and we’re going to ask them to resubmit their capital plans,” he said. “ We also stopped share buybacks and limited dividends.”
The new stress scenarios will be sent on Sept. 30, Powell said.

1545,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 04:36PM ET</span>",Powell Says More Fiscal Policy Needed While Recovery Struggles,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said more fiscal policy will be needed to provide support to the economic recovery, which is at risk of slowing as coronavirus cases spike in several states.
Powell praised Congress for earlier, strong fiscal action, saying the money was “well spent” because it helped keep businesses open and consumers in their homes during what he described as “the biggest shock” to growth in living memory.
“There will be a need both for more support from us and for more fiscal policy,” he said at a press conference following the Federal Open Market Committee’s decision to leave rates unchanged.
The Fed chairman said the path forward is “extraordinarily uncertain,” while warning that the “increase in virus cases and the renewed measures to control it are starting to weigh on economic activity.”
Fine Line
“Some measures of consumer spending, based on debit card and credit card use have moved down since late June, while recent labor-market indicators point to a slowing in job growth especially in smaller businesses,” he said.
Powell has walked a fine line with Congress, trying to avoid specific spending recommendations while advocating for an economy that remains deeply hobbled after 22 million Americans lost their jobs in the pandemic shutdown.
At the press conference, he avoided questions on what to do with funds, such as remaining monies from the first round of stimulus that haven’t been fully used by Fed programs. The Fed chairman did single out industries such as accommodation, entertainment and restaurants where social distancing is difficult, saying jobs in those industries may not come back so long as the virus remains a risk.
“Even if the reopening goes well -- and many, many people go back to work -- it is still going to take a fairly long time for parts of the economy that involve lots of people getting together in close proximity” to recover, he said. “Those people are going to need support. I can’t say what the exact level is going to be, it is not our role.”
Lawmakers are wrangling over fresh support for the U.S. economy, with earlier stimulus measures beginning to run dry amid a surge in coronavirus infections and deaths. The final payments of supplemental unemployment insurance expire this week and federal protections against evictions expired July 25, while mortgage foreclosures also are ending with no agreement in sight.
President Donald Trump said earlier Wednesday that Republicans and Democrats aren’t close to resolving their differences over a coronavirus stimulus package, and that Congress may need to pass some stopgap measures to prevent aid from running out.
Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has rejected the idea of passing a stimulus bill piecemeal and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he wants Congress to act on a comprehensive plan. Senate Republicans unveiled a $1 trillion stimulus package on Monday that is a far cry from the $3.5 trillion proposal that Democrats have put on the table.
Fed officials extended most of their emergency lending programs through the end of the year, and continued to signal today that the benchmark lending rate will be left at zero until the economy is on track to achieve its goals of stable prices and maximum employment.

1546,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 04:27PM ET</span>",Powell Says Fed Lacks Tools for Fighting Black Employment Gap,"(Bloomberg) -- Fiscal, education and health-care policies in the U.S. can do more than monetary policy to combat the higher unemployment rates experienced by Black Americans, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday following the central bank’s July policy meeting.
“We don’t really have tools that can address disparate distributional outcomes,” Powell told reporters.
Economists Jared Bernstein and Janelle Jones have called on the Fed to target the African American unemployment rate when it makes policy decisions in order to better narrow the gap between White and Black unemployment. The Black jobless rate was nearly double that of White Americans’ in February, the peak of the last expansion cycle and a month that policy makers now often look back on wistfully.
Powell has previously talked about the disproportionate impact of pandemic job losses on women and minority Americans, calling it “heartbreaking” at a press conference following the Fed’s April meeting. He made similar remarks Wednesday and insisted the central bank has grown increasingly aware of racial employment gaps.
“We have started in recent years to focus considerable time and attention on disparate levels of unemployment, for example among different racial groups and demographic groups,” he said.
The unemployment rate for women climbed to 15.5% in April, while the overall rate touched 14.7%. The crisis also exacerbated joblessness among Black Americans, for whom unemployment hit 16.7%, though it was even higher for Latino Americans, reaching 18.9% that month, the highest among the largest race groups.
The call to specifically target minority unemployment rates comes as economists look to the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis for lessons in how to jump-start growth more equitably this time around. In late 2015, when the Fed began raising interest rates for the first time since the 2007-2009 recession, the White unemployment rate was at 4.4% but the Black rate was at 9.4%.
Powell and other Fed officials have said that they may be able to run the economy a bit “hotter” in the recovery from this crisis, thereby spurring bigger declines in minority unemployment rates without running up inflation.
Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, Tuesday called for an amendment to the Federal Reserve Act that would require the Fed to report on racial economic gaps and measures its taking to close them. He also pledged to work toward a more diverse Fed.
The Fed’s Board of Governors is currently all White and all but two of the 12 reserve bank presidents are as well. Only a quarter of the Board’s 406 economists are women, and 24% are minorities, whereas 40% of the overall U.S. population is non-White.

“At this meeting, my colleagues and I resumed our discussions” about the review, which was temporarily delayed by the onset of the pandemic, Powell said Wednesday in opening remarks prepared for a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.
“Our focus was on possible enhancements to our statement on longer-run goals and monetary-policy strategy,” Powell said. “While I do not have any details to share with you today, I am confident that we will continue to make progress and will wrap up our deliberations in the near future.”
Fed watchers expect the review -- which was first announced in November 2018 and has preoccupied central bankers for much of the last year and a half -- to conclude in September, and for Fed officials to issue stronger guidance about the path of interest rates by linking the timing of future rate increases to specific thresholds for unemployment and inflation.

1548,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 02:55PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Argentina may delay debt restructuring deadline amid impasse - source,"By Jorge Iorio
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's government is considering pushing back a deadline for creditors to respond to its foreign debt restructuring proposal until mid-to-late August, a source close to the negotiations told Reuters on Wednesday.
The cutoff for the $65 billion deal is currently Aug. 4, though the two sides are at an impasse over the value and legal terms of the final offer, with a large group of creditors rallying behind a counter proposal.
The debt deal is key for recession-hit Argentina to avoid a protracted and messy legal standoff with creditors after tumbling into default in May on its foreign debt.
""It is possible (the date could be delayed),"" the person said. ""It could go even until the end of August. Although there is also talk of around a 15-day delay.""
Argentina and its bondholders have come within striking distance of a deal after months of negotiations, but differences remain between the country's ""final"" offer and what creditors have sought in a counterproposal that has gained wide support.
The country's sovereign bonds have climbed over recent months on rising hopes of a deal, though they dipped in the last couple of days, falling close to 1% on Wednesday.
The government is willing to cede ground on legal terms to reach a deal, but will not increase overall cash flow in the payout, sources told Reuters last week, a position the economy ministry has since confirmed.

However, bondholders have got behind a counterproposal in increasing numbers, demanding a higher payout along with amendments to legal clauses. Analysts say the gap between the two sides is now around 3 cents on the dollar.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Communist-run Cuba is loosening restrictions on small businesses as it seeks to stimulate a state-dominated economy hammered by the implosion of ally Venezuela, U.S. sanctions and the pandemic.
The import-dependent country is reopening after eliminating the new coronavirus in most provinces and bringing it under control in the Havana area.
President Miguel Diaz-Canel, however, speaking earlier this month, said the country faced an ongoing international crisis and would implement a series of reforms to increase exports, cut imports and stimulate domestic demand.
The economy is forecast to decline this year in tandem with the region, or a bit less than 10%.
The measures include more autonomy for state companies, farmers and local government, dollarization of some internal trade and, Diaz-Canel said, ""the improvement of the non-state sector, with immediate priority in the expansion of self-employment and removal of obstacles.""
The non-state sector, excluding agriculture, is composed mainly of small private businesses and cooperatives; their employees, artisans, taxi drivers and tradesmen. All are under the rubric of self-employed, numbering 600,000 before the pandemic left an estimated 40 percent tied to the tourism industry and public transportation without work.
One obstacle already removed is on the right to import and export, albeit through state companies.
""We want to put all forms of management on an equal footing,” Foreign Trade Minister Rodrigo Malmierca said last week during a televised roundtable discussion on the measures.
Economists at home and abroad note the government has promised equal treatment for a decade, so while they back the new measures, it remains to be seen whether they will actually - and effectively - be implemented. 
The task is daunting as the government admits it has little foreign exchange to purchase food, fuel and other supplies from abroad, where the peso is worthless.
Cuba, where the state monopolizes retail and foreign trade, faced a liquidity crisis even before the coronavirus pandemic shuttered tourism and hit other revenue earners.
Pandemic fallout has worsened shortages of food, medicine and other goods and led to long lines at retail outlets.
“We hope that with these new measures doing business will improve,” said Maylen Diaz, who runs a cafeteria in the upscale Vedado area of the capital.
Diaz said that since reopening on July 10, she had faced a daily struggle due to a lack of tourists and supplies.
“I think that some businesses will still have to close, others will continue to subsist and resist as long as they can,” she said.
The first wholesale outlet for private eateries, Mercabal, opened last week in Havana boasting large formats and a 20% discount, but just a few products. 
For more than a decade private businesses have been forced to purchase supplies from state retail shops or on the informal market.
""I saw the list: chicken, beer, sugar, salt, flour, rice; I think there is yeast, there is coffee,” cafeteria owner Enrique Penabella said, waiting in line with other business owners to sign contracts or pick up goods.

“But if they can’t do the same for people in the retail stores, I doubt they can keep it up,” he added.

The International Finance Corp's initiative is largely aimed at private-sector projects to manufacture products such as personal protective equipment, ventilators and other medical equipment, coronavirus test kits, therapeutic drugs and vaccines.
IFC is contributing $2 billion in internal resources with plans for another $2 billion to come from private-sector partners.
The group also intends to work with other international finance institutions to leverage additional funds, IFC Chief Operating Officer Stephanie von Friedenburg told Reuters in an interview. 
She added that IFC also is working with the GAVI global vaccine alliance to identify and finance projects that can boost COVID-19 vaccine production in developing countries.
The World Health Organization estimates that worldwide demand for critical healthcare products, including masks and ventilators, now exceeds supply by more than $60 billion annually.
Initial products financed by the IFC platform will be focused on immediate supply needs, but longer term, the platform aims to finance projects that will build up developing country health care systems, von Friedenburg said.
""We have to expand the capacity of services as well as supplies to make a more resilient future,"" von Friedenburg said.
Because some more sophisticated equipment, such as ventilators, are built largely in developed countries, the initiative also allows up to 30% of the financing to go to projects in developed countries, with commitments to supply developing countries. 

Von Friedenburg said there would be ""an exceptionally high bar"" for such projects in wealthier countries and they would have to prove that they are meeting immediate supply needs.

1551,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 01:07PM ET</span>",U.S. small businesses face mass closures without more pandemic aid,"By Ann Saphir and Jonnelle Marte
OAKLAND, Calif./NEW YORK (Reuters) - After surviving two strokes at age 27, Olivia Colt threw herself into starting a catering business, a lifelong dream. Ten years and another stroke later, she had built Salt & Honey Catering Plus Events into a thriving operation in downtown Oakland.
Now with the coronavirus pandemic forcing cancellations of her customers' weddings and events, she has slashed her staff from 25 to six and tried to drum up new business by selling groceries online. She secured a $100,000 forgivable loan under the U.S. Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and another $150,000 loan under a federal program usually used for natural disasters. She expected the money to get her through just a few months of hardship. 
But the hardships are dragging on. 
""I’ve applied for all the grants and loans, I have maxed out my credit card, used my company's reserves, spent my savings,"" she said.
Colt now fears she may have to shutter her business permanently. Many small businesses nationwide are reaching similar breaking points in an economy with the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression. Small firms have survived the pandemic so far with a mix of government aid, forbearance on debt and rent and creativity in selling to an increasingly homebound and financially distressed populace.
As the first wave of U.S. aid runs short - and landlords and lenders lose patience - lawmakers are in tense negotiations over a new round of stimulus, which could include more money for small business. 
The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
Most firms have already run out of the money they secured from the $600 billion Paycheck Protection Program, according to a survey released this week from the National Federation of Independent Business, a leading trade group for small U.S. firms.
The federation also found in early July that 23% of respondents expected to be out of business within six months unless economic conditions change.. 
Bill Phelan - who tracks small business borrowing for credit reporting firm  Equifax Inc  (NYSE:EFX). - says defaults are up sharply to about 2.7% of small business debt. By next year, his models are predicting a rise to 5% or 6%. (For a graphic on business default trends, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2CVqyzZ )
Defaults peaked at 6.35% in 2009, during the Great Recession, Phelan's data shows. Then, U.S. government stimulus totaled less than $1 trillion - compared with $3 trillion so far since the pandemic hit.
""The forbearance and the PPP have helped out a ton, but they can’t go on forever,"" he said. 
Without a vaccine to fight new waves of infection, Phelan expects double-digit rates of default in hard-hit sectors including hospitality, food service, and retail. 
Business owners like Colt are hard-pressed to stay open without piling up more debt - with no guarantees of success.
""Is it worth taking on more debt, if your business can’t survive?"" she asked.
SURVIVAL STRUGGLE
Colt, whose mother and grandmother immigrated from the Dominican Republic, moved her kitchen in May to a cheaper space in industrial West Oakland. Her previous landlord initially had been understanding but soon started demanding payments she could no longer afford.
The new business she's cobbled together isn't enough. Sales are a third of her pre-pandemic projections. So now she's talking to accountants and lawyers about how to shut down her business - while praying it never comes to that.
Similar dramas are playing out nationwide, especially in states where surges of infection are forcing local officials to tighten restrictions on businesses. Worried consumers are also choosing to stay home and spend less, data from JP Morgan credit-card purchases show. 
That's making business owners take a hard look at shutting down for good, said Ari Takata-Vasquez, who leads the Oakland Indy Alliance, a group of about 500 small firms in Northern California, including Colt's.
""Three weeks ago I noticed a shift in energy,"" Takata-Vasquez said. ""A lot more people seem to have closure on the table."" 
Some 44% of members surveyed recently have only enough money to operate for three months or less, Takata-Vasquez says. To help forestall a rash of failures, the Oakland organization this week launched a campaign to raise $4 million from donors to finance grants to local firms, with priority given to businesses owned by immigrants and people of color.
Business owners who brave the economic conditions still face the ever-present threat of a health-related shutdown. Colt closed her catering operation for two weeks in May, when a worker called in with a fever, to allow her staff to get tested and wait for results. The tests did not find coronavirus.
Farley's East cafe, which used to sell lunches and lattes to Oakland's downtown office workers, has now burned through its PPP funds and gets by through a contract with a nonprofit organization that buys meals from restaurants and distributes them to those in need. Co-owner Chris Hillyard says the cafe's long-term viability depends on office buildings reopening - an outcome looking unlikely anytime soon as California leads U.S. states in COVID-19 infections and area schools won't reopen until the surge subsides.
""We're hanging on,"" Hillyard says. 
WHAT NEXT?
Thousands of miles away in Florida, toy importer Basic Fun Inc says sales are rising sharply as big retailers including Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT) return to more normal operation. But chief executive Jay Foreman doesn't have the $10 million he needs to buy the merchandise to meet that demand.
In Bentonville, Arkansas, Holly Thomas has lost money since February on her printing and shipping company, a family business started by her father three decades ago. She's been paying her five employees, including herself, thanks in large part to a PPP loan of about $55,000. She's trying not to dip into the additional $150,000 she's borrowed from the federal Economic Injury Disaster Loan program.
Revenue for this year through July 24 is down 35% compared from last year. She gave up some storage space to reduce her rent costs by a third, but her health insurance expenses increased by 8% in April. At the current pace, she expects to be out of funds by October or November.
And then what? She worked previously in the film and music industries, and worries it could be hard to find a job in any industry with millions of people unemployed.

""A lot of people are facing that same question - what do I do next?"" she said. ""I know I'm going to be competing with so many people for just a handful of available jobs.""

1552,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>",Fed buying spree could move to long end of yield curve: analysts,"By Karen Pierog
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve may shift more of its buying to the long end of the yield curve, analysts say, as the Treasury market braces for a surge in supply to finance relief efforts in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Such a move, which is not expected before the central bank's September meeting, would avert a potential mismatch in Treasury supply and demand and help stabilize long-end rates. The central bank will conclude its latest monetary policy meeting on Wednesday afternoon.
In March, the U.S. Congress passed the $2.3 trillion CARES Act and the Fed ramped up its Treasury buying. Its purchases have been concentrated on the shorter end of the yield curve, with maturities in the 10-year and longer range accounting for only 22% of the Fed's Treasury holdings as of last week. 
If the Fed does not change the current amount and composition of its purchases in the face of increased supply of Treasuries during the remainder of 2020, ""the supply-demand mismatch could pressure long-end rates,"" according to TD Securities analysts, who said they expect more Fed buying in the 20- to 30-year maturity range.
""Not only will more traditional (quantitative easing) help stabilize long-end rates, but it will help further compress real yields and widen break-evens,"" the analysts said in a recent report.
Graphic: The Fed's Treasury holdings by maturity - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmpjrnampr/Pasted%20image%201596035661817.png
The Democrat-led U.S. House passed a $3 trillion relief bill in May and Senate Republicans on Monday unveiled a $1 trillion aid package. 
Tiffany Wilding, PIMCO's North American economist, said a doubling of the weighted average duration of Fed purchases would bring more accommodation and more downward pressure on yields. 
""Overall, our expectation is that what the Fed takes out the Treasury will basically issue because we are seeing a dramatic increase in Federal government deficits as a result of the various coronavirus stimulus bills,"" she added.
Roberto Perli, partner and head of global policy research at Cornerstone Macro, said shifting purchases toward the long end would make sense given that short-term yields ""are well anchored by expectations that the funds rate will stay at zero for years."" 

""It would make sense to concentrate purchases at the longer end, where rates are less anchored – term premiums would be more responsive, and the Fed could get a greater bang for its buck,"" he said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Top American chief executives on average made 264 times as much as their typical employee in 2019, narrower than the year before, a union report found, but the ratio is expected to rise ""dramatically"" due to COVID-19.
The annual report by the AFL-CIO, the largest U.S. labor federation, is frequently cited as a measure of workforce inequality.
The latest ratio was based on the $14.8 million in total compensation the average S&P 500 chief executive received in 2019, and was less than ratio of 287 to 1 that the labor group found based on corporate proxy filings made for 2018.
The most recent pay data was reported before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down large swaths of the American economy and led companies to lay off or otherwise stop paying millions of workers.
Those lost earnings will raise pay ratios this year, said Brandon Rees, deputy director of the AFL-CIO's office of investment.
""I would expect pay ratios to escalate dramatically for 2020, given the depths of COVID-19 related furloughs,"" Rees said.
The unions' report was based on the ratio that most companies report of the earnings of their CEO to the median pay of all other workers. Across all U.S. companies, production and nonsupervisory employees earned $41,442 on average in 2019, up from $39,888 in 2018, according to U.S. Labor Department figures cited by Rees. 

He said another concern is that high levels of stock-based compensation mean executives are not sharing much pain when they take salary cuts as they lay off workers. [L1N2D91FP]

The National Association of Realtors’ index of contract signings to purchase previously owned homes increased 16.6% after a 44.3% jump in May, according to data released Wednesday. The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 15% month-over-month gain in June. Compared with a year ago, pending sales are up 12.7% on an unadjusted basis.
Along with soaring purchases of new homes, the NAR’s figures show housing is a key source of strength for the economy as it attempts to recover from the recession. At the same time, still-elevated unemployment and the ongoing struggle with Covid-19 threaten to temper the pace of improvement in residential real estate.
“It is quite surprising and remarkable that, in the midst of a global pandemic, contract activity for home purchases is higher compared to one year ago,” Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist, said in a statement. “Consumers are taking advantage of record-low mortgage rates resulting from the Federal Reserve’s maximum liquidity monetary policy.”
Pending home sales rose in all U.S. regions, including an 11.9% gain in the South that boosted the region’s index to the highest in records back to 2001. Purchases also increased 12.2% in the Midwest to the strongest since February 2017 and climbed 11.7% in the West. Contract signings jumped 54.4% in the Northeast to a four-month high.
Record-low mortgage rates and Americans leaving densely-populated cities are contributing to a housing boom as much of the country’s economic recovery stalls. The U.S. homeownership rate in the second quarter is at its highest point since 2008, according to a recent Census Bureau report.
The NAR raised its projection for existing home sales this year to 5.18 million units, up from a May forecast of 4.93 million units. The group also estimates new-home sales to increase 3%.

1555,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 09:51AM ET</span>",How the coronavirus is crushing credit ratings,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The crippling effects of the coronavirus crisis have crushed government and corporate finances and sent debt soaring. As the charts below show, it is also crunching their credit ratings and causing a spike in defaults.
1/BROKEN RECORDS
S&P Global has already made 1,190 downgrades so far this year. That is just 136 short of the record 1,326 set in 2009 during the global financial crisis, and more than four months are left in the year.
Almost 975 of those downgrades have been directly affected by COVID or the partly related collapse in oil prices. If cuts to rating outlooks are also added, that number rises to 1,939. 
Fitch isn't far behind. It has had nearly 1,500 negative rating actions altogether, although total downgrades is less than half S&P's at 441. 
(GRAPHIC - COVID causing record spike in rating downgrades COVID causing record spike in rating downgrades: https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/nmopalqwkva/chart.png)
2/ACROSS THE BOARD
Every sector has been affected by the coronavirus, but energy and oil companies, retailers, media and entertainment companies, airlines, travel and leisure, banks and capital goods firms have been hit the worst.
It has also been global. S&P has downgraded or cut the outlook on 1,015 firms in North America. Latin America's 180 negative actions work out at almost 60% of the region's ratings. That compares with 35% to 40% for the rest of the world. 
Governments have been hit hard, too. Fitch has made a record number of sovereign downgrades -- 32 rating actions affecting 26 sovereigns -- including pushing two of the biggest borrowers, Italy and Mexico, into the danger zone. More than a third of its 118 sovereign grades are also still on downgrade warnings.
S&P has made 19 sovereign downgrades and 31 outlook cuts, while Moody’s estimates the virus will push up debt in the world’s richest nations by close to 20 percentage points on average, almost double the damage done by the financial crash. 
(GRAPHIC - Breakdown of credit rating downgrades: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklvydnqypg/Pasted%20image%201595980556401.png)
3/FALLEN ANGELS
S&P's count of fallen angels, or issuers downgraded to junk (""BB+"" or lower) from investment grade (""BBB-"" or higher) has hit 34 issuers with over $320 billion in rated debt among them, including Ford, Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY), Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC),  Renault  (PA:RENA), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Lufthansa, British Airways and Macy’s. 
They have all been companies so far, although Moody's (NYSE:MCO) has cut South Africa to junk and Italy, India, Colombia, Morocco, Romania, Uruguay and Mexico are all near the brink with at least one of the main agencies. 
Fallen angels are significant because the prospect of losing investment-grade ratings can lead investors to sell the bonds in favour of more creditworthy companies, pushing up their borrowing costs.
S&P also has a record 126 potential fallen angels on a warning. They have another $576 billion of bonds, meaning the amount of debt affected is likely to rise.

4/FALLEN AAAngels
Canada has been the only country so far to be stripped of a prized ""triple A"" credit rating, by Fitch last month. Fitch now has the fewest ""AAAs"" since 1998, with a total of 10. That is less than 10% of the countries it rates, which is the smallest ever share of the sovereign portfolio.
Analysts at ING estimate that the collective share of triple-A rated government debt is now below 25%. S&P, which no longer grades the U.S. -the world’s biggest government borrower -- as triple A, calculated it to be around 7% last year. 
(GRAPHIC - Falling AAAngels: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgpdllympo/Pasted%20image%201593176045677.png)
5/DEFAULTS 
S&P has predicted nearly 290, or 15.5%, of U.S. junk-rated companies could default by next March in a pessimistic scenario, while in Europe it could reach 11.5%. Moody's meanwhile saw Germany's scandal-hit Wirecard became its first investment grade firm to collapse since Saudi Arabia's Saad Group in 2009. 
A record four sovereigns have already defaulted: Argentina, Ecuador, Lebanon and Suriname. All four were in trouble before the pandemic struck, but Fitch warns others are probable, with Gabon, Mozambique, Republic of Congo and Zambia all potential worries.

1556,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 09:51AM ET</span>",London expects only half of bankers back at their desks this year,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - London's normally buzzing financial districts will still be a pale shadow by the end of the year, as banks plan for no more than half their staff, who have mostly worked from home throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, to come to the office.
The leader of the City of London, Catherine McGuinness, said on Wednesday that banks were saying their office capacity was likely to be 40-50% at best, because of the need to space desks out and limit public transport use for coronavirus hygiene.
Many staff will feel able to return in September to both the City and its offshoot at Canary Wharf, despite possible anxiety about using public transport, because schools should reopen then.
But the reduced numbers will inevitably mean that some of those districts' cafes, barbers and other shops, by then deprived of government support payments, shut for good.
""We will see a 'new normal' gradually develop even after we have dealt with the virus,"" McGuinness told Reuters, ""but we are confident there is a place for the office for gathering people.""
The City must also handle the end of Britain's post-Brexit transition arrangements with the European Union in December.
Access to the UK financial sector's biggest customer, now unfettered, will depend in future on Brussels deeming UK rules to be ""equivalent"", a process still dragging on.
McGuinness said she was disappointed that the talks had been so slow and become politicised.
She urged the government to let EU financial firms access the UK, to help keep global financial trade flowing through London, without waiting to see what Brussels does:
""I urge our politicians to be pragmatic ... we have got to maintain our competitive edge for the future.""
LEGACY OF SLAVERY
McGuinness also promised that the City would tackle racism and reflect ""the fullness of history"", after a task force set up in June because of the Black Lives Matter movement reports back in the autumn.
The trading of slaves from Britain's colonies in West Africa to the Americas brought vast wealth to Britain and the City in the 17th and 18th centuries.
It was only in 2015 that the state finally paid off the huge debt, worth 40% of the then-national budget, taken out to compensate owners after slavery was abolished in 1835.
The Lloyd's of London insurance market has apologised for covering many slave ships, and the Bank of England has apologised for the ""inexcusable"" connections to the trade of some of its former governors and directors.
In June, Black Lives Matter protesters in Bristol toppled a statue of Edward Colston, a slave trader who was one of the city's leading benefactors.
McGuinness said it was too early to say if any statues would be removed from the City of London.
One that has been mentioned is a huge monument to William Beckford, twice Lord Mayor of London in the 1760s, who was the largest slave owner of his time and became rich thanks to the slaves who worked his plantations in Jamaica.

The stone statue and monument stand in the Guildhall, the ornate seat of the City of London Corporation, where McGuinness formally chairs the policy and resources committee.

Britain left the EU in January and financial firms continue to have unfettered access the bloc under transition arrangements that end on December 31.
Many big banks have already opened up hubs in the bloc to continue serving customers there. The European Banking Authority said that these banks must now finalise the ""full execution"" of their Brexit plans, as agreed in their new licences.
""In particular, financial institutions should ensure that associated management capacity, including appropriate technical risk management capabilities, is effectively placed ahead of time,"" EBA said.
This should be ""commensurate to the magnitude, scope and complexity of their activities"", it said.

The new EU hubs are expected to increase their footprint in the bloc proportionally to the amount of business carried out there.

1558,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>",Insurers walk tightrope of risky corporate credit,"By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Normally among the most conservative of investors, insurers facing shrinking returns and big future payouts are delving increasingly into riskier corporate debt, potentially exposing themselves to defaults and more regulatory scrutiny. 
Insurers globally invest more than $20 trillion (15.42 trillion pounds), but their investment positions, already perilous from years of falling bond yields, were left with large holes following this year's coronavirus-linked slide in asset prices.
Markets have since recovered, but insurers face another conundrum -- with interest rates close to 0% or less across the developed world, government bonds often no longer provide the returns needed to pay claims and pensions.
Taking more risk for higher returns seems to be the strategy; a recent survey by  State Street  (NYSE:STT) found 33% of insurers planned to expand private credit investment in the short term.
""We are seeing that the move into negative interest rates is leading to a push into higher-yielding assets,"" said Gerard Fitzpatrick, head of fixed income portfolio management at Russell Investments. ""Credit is an area gathering more interest from insurance clients."" 
Etienne Comon, EMEA head of insurance at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management, said several of the firm's large life insurance clients had upped allocations to corporate credit by as much as 10 percentage points in March and April.
European investment-grade corporate debt -- a category rated BBB-minus and above -- currently yield more than one percentage point over safe-as-houses German government bonds on average. Riskier junk bonds yield on average around five percentage points more.
Graphic: Corp bond yields vs Bunds - Corp bond yields vs Bunds
However, the move into credit comes as the pandemic fallout leaves companies vulnerable to rating downgrades and insolvency risk.
S&P Global predicts the ratings of $640 billion of European and U.S. bonds will fall into junk this year. 
And default rates among European companies already rated junk rose in June to 2.8%, versus 1.2% a year earlier, according to Moody's (NYSE:MCO). Default rates could hit 6.2% next June, it reckons.
RISING RISK
Low returns are prompting more investors to disregard the junk-rating barrier. But insurers, who need to make fixed payments to policyholders, have greater regulatory constraints on how much risk they can take.
A quarterly risk dashboard published in May by the European Union's insurance regulator, EIOPA, showed insurers' credit risk was high and rising. 
Large UK insurers' solvency levels are around 150%, according to the Bank of England. That's a healthy buffer; anything above 100% indicates insurers have enough capital to run their businesses under European solvency rules.
The Bank warned, however, ""if an asset (on the insurer's books) is too highly rated, a firm may be holding insufficient reserves to meet the risk of default or downgrade.""
Credit downgrades mean insurers must set aside more capital they could otherwise use for acquisitions or ploughing into the company. The riskier an asset, the more capital an insurer must hold against it.
So far, 4% of sterling investment-grade bonds have been downgraded, but 26% are on negative outlook, making them vulnerable to cuts, UBS notes. That could come after companies release first-half results. 
Holding a BBB-rated 10-year corporate bond would incur a 20% capital charge, rising to 35% for a junk BB-rated 10-year bond under European rules, according to data supplied by  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management (WFAM).
This year's declines in asset prices have already had an impact. European insurers' solvency ratios dropped around 20 percentage points in the first quarter and are likely to remain at those levels, Moody's analysts estimate.
A three-notch ratings downgrade across corporate debt portfolios, requiring more capital to be held against the assets, would strip a further 30 to 50 percentage points from solvency levels, they added. 
Insurers need to differentiate between corporates, said Henrietta Pacquement, head of investment grade, Credit Europe, at WFAM. ""Credit work is going to be more intensive than in recent years.""

Legal & General,  Aviva  (LON:AV) and Dutch insurer Aegon (NYSE:AEG) are among insurers whose portfolios and capital positions will be in focus when they release first-half results next month.

1560,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 06:32AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday, July 29th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve's regular policy meeting ends, with Jerome Powell likely to present a more gloomy outlook than before when he holds his press conference. The CEOs of four Big Tech companies travel to Washington to tell lawmakers that they're not monopolists. Stocks are set to open higher after some reassuringly strong earnings late on Tuesday (notably from chipmaker AMD), the dollar is still under pressure, and oil prices bounce back after the American Petroleum Institute indicates crude demand stayed buoyant last week. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, July 29th.
1. Powell to strike cautious note after Fed meeting
The Federal Reserve will conclude a two-day meeting of its policy-making Federal Open Markets Committee. The committee’s decisions are due at 2 PM ET (1400 GMT), and Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference will follow half an hour later.
No immediate changes to monetary policy are expected, although the Fed did announce on Tuesday that it will extend seven of its nine emergency lending facilities for another three months, creating a safety net that may be needed if the global wave of Covid-19 infections continues to rise.
Given the generally downbeat tone of comments from Fed officials before the blackout, there is a chance that the central bank’s guidance will take on a more ‘dovish’ note, with increasingly heavy hints of future easing if necessary. Expectations of as much have been a large factor behind the recent surge in gold and Treasury bond prices.
The dollar index hit a new 22-month low.
2. Monopolists? Us?
Representatives of four of the U.S.’s biggest tech companies will appear before the House of Representatives’ Antitrust Sub-Committee on Capitol Hill, in an effort to persuade lawmakers that they aren’t concentrating excessive wealth and power in the U.S.
The committee will hear evidence from Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai.  
In prepared remarks released ahead of the hearing, the four all stressed their ability to meet demands for new goods and services and strenuously downplayed suggestions that their success was due to monopoly power.
The four companies combined, along with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), now represent 22% of the S&P 500 market capitalization, a higher degree of concentration than anything seen in the last 20 years.
3. Stocks set to open higher; AMD's strong quarter supports; Industrial heavyweights to report
U.S. stock markets are set to open mostly higher ahead of what could be a bumpy session for megacap stocks, depending on how the Congressional hearing goes.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 25 points or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 0.5%
There’ll be earnings updates before the bell from Boeing, Shopify and automotive mid-cap General Motors, among others. Top billing after the close goes to PayPal and Qualcomm. The latter will have to live up a better-than-expected performance from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which is indicated to open 11% higher after a strong quarterly report late on Tuesday.
4. Euro banks ravaged by Covid-19 provisions
Europe's banks followed the pattern of U.S. ones in the second quarter. Those with relatively big investment banking arms, such as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC), were able to offset heavy provisions for credit losses with windfall gains in the stock and, especially, the bond and currency markets. 
Main street lenders fared worse. Spanish-based Santander (MC:SAN) took a $14 billion charge against the value of its assets, mostly against its struggling U.K. subsidiary. As with Dutch bank ING on Tuesday, it took the hit as a non-cash charge against goodwill, thus sparing its sensitive capital ratio. The European Central Bank had said on Tuesday it would give banks until at least the end of 2022 to get over the worst ravages of Covid-19 on their balance sheet but ""recommended"" that they pay no dividends this year.
Unicredit (MI:CRDI), which had big dividend plans at the start of the year, indicated on Wednesday it will comply with the recommendation.
5. Oil stabilizes after API data
Oil prices have stabilized after the American Petroleum Institute’s weekly estimate of U.S. crude inventories showed a much bigger draw than expected. The API estimated a draw of 6.83 million barrels, much bigger than the 1.2 million draw forecast.
However, stocks of both gasoline and distillates both posted unexpected increases. The official government data are due as usual at 10:30 AM ET (1430 GMT).
U.S. crude futures were up 1.0% at $41.45 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent was up 1.2% at $44.11 a barrel.
Jitters about the strength of both U.S. and global demand are being made worse by the awareness that OPEC and its allies are about to release 2 million barrels a day more crude into the world market from Aug. 1. Analysts at Rystad Energy say that may be enough to tip the market back into surplus."
1561,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 06:21AM ET</span>","Fed faces viral wave, mounting risks to recovery","By Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - In a fast-changing global pandemic, this was not the turn U.S. Federal Reserve officials hoped for in early June, when their forecasts showed guarded optimism for a sharpish early economic rebound and steady slow growth to follow.
In the ensuing seven weeks, much has gone downhill. 
The coronavirus pandemic has intensified and prompted new economic restrictions. Data has pointed to a possible slowdown in business and hiring. And so-far stalled talks in Washington about further government relief have pushed the country to the brink of a spending cliff.
(GRAPHIC - The Fed confronts a new wave The Fed confronts a new wave: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/FOMC/yzdvxnxxxvx/chart.png) 
The risks to the U.S. recovery, in short, have grown substantially, and the new Fed policy statement to be released Wednesday afternoon will show just how seriously U.S. central bankers assess them. On Tuesday the Fed already made one nod to the outlook, extending from Sept. 30 to Dec. 31 the availability of the emergency credit programs it set up early in the pandemic when hopes of a quick ""V"" shaped recovery were still strong.
(GRAPHIC - The screws retighten? The screws retighten?: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/SMALLBIZ/xlbpgbnkevq/chart.png) 
Fed officials ""always feared a rushed reopening would lead to a virus resurgence that would cap the recovery,"" said Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI. Now that the disease has raced back over the summer, the Fed ""is grappling with whether this is a short-term or longer-range setback and what the implications are for its policy."" 
The policy statement will be released at 2 pm EDT (1800 GMT) and Fed chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a press conference a half hour later. No new economic projections will be issued at this meeting.
Nor is the Fed expected to announce any major policy decisions on Wednesday. Officials may point to a pending shift this fall in how it views its inflation target, or begin setting explicit goals for the jobless rate or inflation to be met before it considers raising interest rates from the current near-zero level. 
That goal-based guidance seemed to be favored by policymakers according to minutes of the June Fed meeting, and several Fed analysts have said they expect it to be announced at the September Federal Open Market Committee session.
But with a dozen new programs rolled out since March to fight the economic fallout from the pandemic, the Fed is now watching to see how the economy and events evolve.
Those measures were meant largely as emergency support for an economy that likely registered a historic nosedive in the April through June quarter. First estimates of growth in gross domestic product for that period will be issued Thursday, and the median estimate of economists polled by Reuters is for an annualized decline of 34%.
In addition recent data suggest the hoped-for rebound, which started with an unexpected round of hiring in May and June, may have plateaued - a motivation for the Fed's extending its emergency programs at least through the end of the year.
The official jobless rate fell from 14.7% in April to 11.1% in June, for example, but a survey by the Dallas Federal Reserve since then, as well as a new employment forecast by the St. Louis Federal Reserve, both suggest employment dipped this month. Last week new claims for unemployment insurance rose for the first time since March.
(GRAPHIC - A July jobs dip?: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/SMALLBIZ/gjnpwxemkvw/chart.png)
""The spike in virus cases is indeed sucking the oxygen out of the robust economic recovery"" that seemed to be taking shape in May and June, wrote Bank of the West chief economist Scott Anderson in a July 24 analysis.
Also of concern, several of the key measures approved at the start of the pandemic to try to bolster families and businesses are coming to an end, perhaps most notably the $600 a week addition to unemployment insurance benefits. Members of Congress are debating a possible extension, but the benefit expires this week - a sign in general that the pandemic is on a different timetable than that envisioned by elected leaders when they approved the initial pandemic relief package.
The unemployment benefits are currently being received by around 30 million people, pumping $18 billion of disposable income into the economy each week. Along with the $520 billion loaned to small businesses under the Paycheck Protection Program, many firms and families were able to sustain spending, make rent and mortgage payments, and hold off what would have been a far worse economic shock
As the Fed meets the outcome of congressional negotiations over further relief remains uncertain - another risk, this one under human control - to the economic landscape.
""If these programs aren’t extended, layoffs could rise and job growth could weaken further. While the recession was abrupt, the labor market recovery is expected to be a long, uneven slog,"" Anderson said.
Consumers may already be poised to buckle. The Conference Board's index of consumer expectations dropped sharply in July. Major states like Florida, Texas and California saw large declines, which were ""no doubt a result of the resurgence of COVID-19,"" survey director Lynn Franco said on Tuesday.

""Looking ahead, consumers have grown less optimistic about the short-term outlook for the economy and labor market and remain subdued about their financial prospects. Such uncertainty about the short-term future does not bode well for the recovery, nor for consumer spending,” she said.

Haldane, who voted against expanding BoE stimulus last month, said estate agents had seen a rapid rebound in activity since reopening in May, probably reflecting pent-up demand.
""While the outlook is inevitably uncertain, given the possibility of further job losses, most felt relatively upbeat about the outlook. So far, then, so good,"" he wrote in an article for regional business publication North East Times Magazine.
Community groups offered a gloomier assessment, however.

""People previously 'just about managing' have suddenly found themselves struggling, increasingly reliant on food banks,"" Haldane said.

1563,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>",U.S. Is About to Unveil the Ugliest GDP Report Ever Recorded,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy ground to a halt for almost the entirety of April. Now the world is about to find out the depth of that contraction.
Data due Thursday are forecast to show U.S. gross domestic product plummeted an annualized 34.8% in the second quarter, the most in records dating back to the 1940s, after the spread of Covid-19 prompted Americans to stay home and states to order widespread lockdowns.
Even though economic activity picked up in May and June as stay-at-home orders lifted, the scale of the decline in April likely far outweighed any gains later in the quarter.
Here are some questions and answers about the report:
Did the U.S. economy actually shrink by one-third?
No. The Bureau of Economic Analysis, the government agency that compiles the GDP figures, has historically reported the headline numbers as an annualized rate. That shows what the quarterly change would be if it lasted a full year.
Before the crisis, the economy was usually growing by a few tenths of a percentage point each quarter, resulting in an annualized pace typically ranging from 2% to 3%.
This means the main number Thursday will look much worse than reality. A 35% contraction on an annual basis actually means the economy was about 10% smaller in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter.
Even so, that would still be far beyond the record quarterly decline on an annual basis -- 10% in the first quarter of 1958, which coincided with a global flu pandemic.
The latest figure, which is the first of three estimates, may be revised in the next two months and also in coming years like all GDP reports, and revisions could be bigger than usual.
What drove the second-quarter contraction?
Mostly a collapse in consumer spending, which typically accounts for about two-thirds of GDP, as Americans stayed home -- erasing spending on dining out, physical retail and travel. Personal consumption is projected to have plummeted an annualized 34.5% in the quarter, which would also be a record.
Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc, projects a 36% drop in second-quarter consumer spending. That translates to about 25 percentage points of the projected 35-point annualized decline in GDP.
What Our Economists Say
“Lockdowns enforced in March through April led to a plunge in consumer spending. As restrictions lifted, the initial recovery was rapid, but will remain partial amid a resurgence of virus cases and orders to pause or reverse reopening plans.”
-- Andrew Husby, Eliza Winger and Yelena Shulyatyeva
It’s not just personal consumption, though. A 40% decline in residential investment and a 50% drop in equipment spending, as well as drags from net exports and inventories, all likely contributed. The only major category Gapen expects will be positive is government consumption and investment, though it will add less than a percentage point to growth.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co., though, expects government outlays to be negative despite enormous federal stimulus. Why? Lower spending by state and local governments that have seen plunging tax revenues.
Won’t the economy come back strongly in the second half?
Yes, but activity may remain below pre-pandemic levels for several years, and the recovery is already showing signs of stalling.
The economy is expected to grow an annualized 18% in the third quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists in early July. That would be just ahead of the record 16.7% pace in the first quarter of 1950.
“The question is, how sustainable is that bounce?” said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
Amid a surge in new virus cases in the South and West, many states have paused or even reversed reopening plans, and measures of mobility and restaurant bookings have plateaued. Lawmakers are in the midst of debating another round of fiscal stimulus, with the supplemental $600 in weekly unemployment benefits about to expire.
If the economy starts to deteriorate, the fourth quarter could show a contraction, said Gapen.
What does it all mean for the election?
American voters will decide in three months whether to re-elect President Donald Trump to a second term against a backdrop of a virus-induced recession and his response to the health crisis.
Before the pandemic, Trump’s goal was for a sustained pace of 3% economic growth. Now, the coronavirus has left its own mark on Trump’s economic legacy -- with the declaration of a recession and likely the worst quarterly GDP decline on record.
The GDP figures for the third quarter -- the anticipated rebound -- are due Oct. 29, just five days before Election Day. Trump is well aware of the timing.
“We’re going to have a great third quarter,” he said in an interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity last week. “And the nice thing about the third quarter is the results are going to come out before the election.”
While the results may in theory sway some last-minute deciders, many of those who mail in ballots will have already made their choice -- - especially if mail-in ballots happen in greater numbers this year as a result of Covid-19 concerns.

1564,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>",Explainer: How the next WTO chief will be chosen and the task ahead,"GENEVA/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Eight candidates from Mexico to Moldova are bidding to become the next director-general of the World Trade Organization to replace Robert Azevedo, who steps down at the end of August.
CHALLENGES
The next chief would broker international trade talks in the face of widening U.S.-China conflict, protectionism increased by the COVID-19 pandemic and pressure to reform trade rules.
U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" policies have upended the global trading order and presented an existential threat to the WTO, which the president has described as ""broken"" and ""horrible"". Washington has blocked appointments to the WTO's Appellate Body that settles trade disputes, which now no longer has the minimum number of judges to convene.
HOW THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL IS CHOSEN
The candidates have been given two months to campaign until September 7. Normally this would involve trips to national capitals, but with the COVID-19 pandemic much of that is being done in a virtual format.
The next phase involves whittling down the field, most likely first to five, then two before a final decision is taken.
The WTO is a members-driven organisation with decisions reached by consensus among 164 countries. Three WTO ambassadors who chair leading committees will lead the process, seeking to establish which candidates have the widest support.
In so-called ""confessionals"", members will tell this ""troika"" their preferences, without ranking them and without vetoes in a process expected to last two months. Voting on the next director-general is seen only as a last resort if consensus cannot be reached.
The process does not always work smoothly. In 1999, former New Zealand prime minister Mike Moore and Thailand's Supachai Panitchpakdi divided WTO members, with a compromise finally found to give each a term, shortened to three years from four.
Because Azevedo's term will finish before his replacement takes office, members must also agree on a temporary caretaker director-general from among four of his deputies.
MORE SOFT THAN HARD POWER
The Marrakesh Agreement that established the WTO in 1995 does not give a detailed description of the director-general role. The responsibilities should be ""exclusively international in character"".
The incoming chief would be expected to appoint four new deputies, present budget proposals, and chair the trade negotiations committee which oversees multilateral accords such as on fishing subsidies.
The director-general can also intervene in trade disputes, in very rare cases offering mediation, more often by appointing people to adjudicating panels when parties cannot agree.

Otherwise, the director-general does not forge global trade policy, but is meant to act as a neutral broker: part administrator, part peacemaker.

Starting in the fourth quarter, euro-area banks will be grouped together according to business model rather than by size. The ECB will establish dedicated units for conducting on-site investigations and setting supervisory strategy and governance.
ECB President Christine Lagarde has promised more transparency at the central bank since taking over in November, as has Andrea Enria, who has led the oversight arm since the start of 2019. While some European bankers have faulted the watchdog for not giving them sufficient disclosure, former officials at the supervisor argued that banks could exploit a surplus of information.
The overhaul will be “headcount-neutral and cost-neutral,” the ECB said in a statement on Wednesday. It named the following five people as heads of business areas:
The managers for the on-site and internal models inspections as well as supervisory strategy and risk business areas will be appointed and announced later, the ECB said.

Furlough programs have kept millions on payrolls, allowing countries like Germany, France or Spain to avoid a massive jump in unemployment that the U.S. experienced since the start of the pandemic. But a sluggish recovery means some companies won’t be able to afford to bring back all workers.
The issue -- covered in two articles in the ECB’s latest Economic Bulletin -- is key to the outlook for the economy, where a rise in joblessness could mean even weaker demand, feeding further job cuts in a vicious cycle. It’s why central banks keep highlighting the labor market as a major risk, and why many governments have tried to extend programs that protect jobs as long as possible.
“It is to be expected that not all workers in short-time work schemes and on temporary lay-offs will be able to return to their previous jobs,” the economists said in the bulletin. “As a consequence, a further increase in unemployment in the euro area is expected in the short term.”
They also used hiring information from the LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) networking site to estimate the jobless rate reached 9.5% at the beginning of May, far higher than the 7.4% in official statistics for that month.
The ECB analysis, using data from the region’s five largest economies, shows that consumer goods, manufacturing, recreation and travel sectors have been hit hardest since the crisis erupted earlier this year.
Crucially, it also said that postings on job website Indeed continue to signal that labor demand remains weak.
“If recalls from temporary unemployment do not occur in full, a jump in the job separation rate may lead to a further deterioration in labor market conditions,” the ECB researchers said.

BOGOR, Indonesia (Reuters) - As Indonesian Muslims prepare to celebrate the Eid al-Adha festival, farms are seeing a boom in online sales that limit the need for people to visit farms during the pandemic to buy the goats, sheep and cows traditionally sacrificed at this time.
Health experts have been concerned about the risks of the coronavirus being spread during religious festivals in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country when people typically gather in mosques and homes, or travel to their home towns.
Mahir Farm launched online sales of livestock in 2018 and this year the farm near Bogor, south of the capital Jakarta, has seen sales surge 50% compared to 2019.    
""We know that people rarely go out or they are worried about interacting with others during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Azmi Abdul Gaffar, 22, who is one of the farm's owners.
Indonesia has reported more than 100,000 coronavirus cases and over 4,800 fatalities, the highest toll in East Asia.
""That's why this (selling online) is an answer to the problem,"" said Gaffar.
During Eid al-Adha, Muslims around the world traditionally purchase livestock and after slaughter the meat is distributed to poorer members of the community.
Mahir farm has sold 15,000 goats, sheep and cows via social media platforms ahead of the festival that starts on Friday, accounting for at least 80% of the season's profit, Gaffar said.
The animals at the farm are also certified as COVID-19 free and undergo daily health checks by a veterinarian, he said. 
Another farm owner in the area, Ahmad Risyad, said having online sales meant buyers did not have to visit his premises.
And for one of his customers, buying livestock this way has clear advantages.

""It's safer to do the transaction online, and it is much cheaper,"" said Reza Wibisono, 24, who received a delivery of sheep purchased online for 3.1 million rupiah ($214).

TOKYO (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Masayoshi Amamiya said the central bank will not rule out deepening negative interest rates as part of efforts to cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus pandemic.
But he said the BOJ must be vigilant to the cost of any such steps, warning that excessively low rates could hurt financial institutions' profits and discourage them from lending.
""When considering additional easing steps, we must be mindful than ever before of their potential side-effects,"" Amamiya told a news conference on Wednesday.
""Having said that, we have various options available including deeper negative rates,"" he added. ""We won't rule out the chance of taking rates deeper into minus territory.""
Despite years of heavy money printing, central banks in Japan, the United States and Europe have failed to pull their economies out of a low-growth, low-inflation environment.
As the pandemic pushes Japan deeper into recession, the BOJ eased policy twice this year mainly by ramping up asset buying and creating a scheme to pump money to cash-strapped firms.
Amamiya said Japan's economy was ""shifting toward a recovery phase"" as a raft of monetary and fiscal stimulus measures help curb corporate bankruptcies and job losses.
But he warned a protracted health crisis could destabilise Japan's banking system and keep inflation distant from the BOJ's 2% target through the year ending in March 2023.
While brushing aside the chance of ditching the 2% price goal, Amamiya said central banks must be open to debating how structural changes in the economy could reshape monetary policy and the appropriate time-frame for achieving their price targets.

""It's important for us to always study what the appropriate monetary policy and the time-frame (for hitting the price goal) could be, given potential changes in the way the economy and prices interact with each other,"" he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government expects the economy will contract this year as activity slowly recovers from the coronavirus crisis, with a return to growth seen next year, four government sources told Reuters.
Reflecting uncertainty over how long the pandemic will last, the government will take the unusual step of announcing several growth scenarios for 2020 and 2021 this week, based on whether the pandemic will end quickly or be prolonged, the sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.
Real gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to shrink in the current fiscal year through March 2021 under either scenario, but it would be smaller than a 5% contraction, one of the sources said.
The government had previously forecast 1.4% growth this fiscal year based on a boost to domestic demand from stronger corporate investment and a fiscal package it approved last December. 
Analysts in a recent Reuters poll expected the economy to shrink 5.3% for the year as a whole, the fastest pace in decades, but believe it has begun rebounding in the current quarter and would grow 3.3% in 2021. [ECILT/JP]
The world's third-largest economy is expected to have contracted 23.9% in the second quarter as the pandemic slammed global demand and Japan's state of emergency prompted people to stay at home and businesses to close. Preliminary GDP data will be released on Aug 17.
Under its most pessimistic scenario for the fiscal year through March 2022, the government expects to see nearly flat, but still positive GDP growth, another source said.
The Nikkei business daily reported earlier on Wednesday that the government will forecast GDP to contract by around 4.5% for fiscal 2020, followed by a 3.5% expansion for fiscal 2021.
The government has set a target to raise nominal GDP to 600 trillion yen ($5.71 trillion) by around 2020 but it will be delayed to around 2023, the Nikkei report said.
The government's economic outlook is more optimistic, especially of the current year, than projections made by others as stimulus steps to respond to the coronavirus crisis were accounted for, it said.
Rating agency Fitch on Wednesday lowered its outlook on the country's long-term foreign currency debt rating to negative from stable, citing the impact from the pandemic and rising public debt as policymakers try to get the economy back on track. It affirmed Japan's rating at 'A'.

Japan has so far pledged to spend a combined $2.2 trillion in two stimulus packages to combat the heavy blow from the pandemic.

Chinese state lenders have been revamping contingency plans in anticipation of U.S. legislation that could penalise banks for serving officials who implement the new national security for Hong Kong, Reuters reported earlier this month.
Greater use of the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) instead of the Belgium based SWIFT system would also reduce exposure of China's global payments data to the United States, BOC International (BOCI) said in the report, which was co-authored by a former foreign exchange regulator.
The bank's chief economist Guan Tao was previously a director of the international payments department of State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).
The report looked at potential measures the United States could take against Chinese banks, including cutting off their access to the SWIFT financial messaging service, a primary network used by banks globally to make financial transactions.
""A good punch to the enemy will save yourself from hundreds of punches from your enemies,"" the report wrote, amid deteriorating relating between the world's two largest economies. ""We need to get prepared in advance, mentally and practically.""
China launched the CIPS clearing and settlement services system in 2015 to help internationalise use of the yuan. Supervised by the central bank, CIPS said it processed 135.7 billion yuan ($19.4 billion) a day in 2019, with participation from 96 countries and regions. 
The report said that if the United States were to take the extreme action of cutting off some Chinese banks' access to dollar settlements, China should also consider stopping using the U.S. dollar as the anchor currency for its foreign exchange controls.
It also recommended that China develop legislation similar to the European Union's Blocking Statute, which allowed the EU to sustain trade and economic relations with Iran, a country targeted by U.S. sanctions. 

The chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], the world’s biggest producer of telecoms equipment, is currently fighting against extradition from Canada to the United States, where she is accused of bank fraud for misleading  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA) about Huawei's relationship with a company operating in Iran, putting HSBC at risk of fines and penalties for breaking U.S. sanctions.

The new chief, with a five-year term, will face the tough task of steering Southeast Asia's second-largest economy through the coronavirus pandemic, and with near-zero interest rates and high household debt.
""The cabinet has approved Sethaput as a new central bank governor to replace Veerathai (Santiprabhob), whose term ends on Sept. 30,"" the source told Reuters.
Sethaput had been widely tipped to get the job. He sits on the Bank of Thailand (BOT)'s Monetary Policy Committee and holds a doctorate in economics from Yale University.
The BOT predicts the economy will shrink by a record 8.1% this year as the coronavirus outbreak has decimated tourism and slowed domestic activity.
Last week, acting Finance Minister Santi Promphat said the 24th central bank governor must be ""good, competent and honest"".
The finance minister was responsible for selecting the central bank governor from two shortlisted candidates before proposing his selection to the cabinet for approval. There were initially six candidates. 
The appointment also needs royal endorsement.

Government officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the appointment.

The programme will offer guarantee for working capital loans of between 10 billion rupiah to 1 trillion rupiah for a period of up to a year to help businesses with their cashflow.
""We hope the risk appetite from banks as well as companies can be restored and thus result in optimism to conduct activities,"" Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told a streamed press conference on Wednesday, noting banks had been cautious giving out loans despite having ample liquidity.
The government is offering a guarantee for up to 80% of loans for companies in priority sectors such as tourism, automotive, textile and garment, and electronics.
The loan guarantee scheme is an expansion of a previously announced initiative to help small businesses recover from the impact of the pandemic.
Businesses eligible for the latest programme are those affected by the pandemic employing at least 300 people and seen as having potential to support the country's economic growth.
Businesses in the priority sectors needed as much as 303.76 trillion in working capital over the next six month to meet operational costs after cash flows had dried up due to social restrictions to curb the virus, Rosan Roeslani, chairman of Indonesia’s chamber of commerce and industry (Kadin), said on Tuesday.
Southeast Asia's largest economy has been trying to boost loan disbursement by channelling liquidity to state-owned banks and regional banks.
The financial regulator has also relaxed restructuring rules to help banks manage their capital.

Indonesia's loan growth in May expanded just 3.04% on-year, the weakest pace since at least December, 2002, as the pandemic took its toll on the economy.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The outlook for India's reeling economy has worsened again as business activity slows and COVID-19 infections soar, and will probably prompt the Reserve Bank of India to cut interest rates again soon, a Reuters poll of economists suggests.
The latest findings echo recent criticism of New Delhi's $266 billion economic rescue package, which does not include new spending, tax breaks or cash support, suggesting more will be needed to turn the economy around.
With India now the third-worst-hit country by number of infections after the United States and Brazil, the risk of renewed lockdowns after a nationwide shutdown in March-May has risen.
The Indian economy is now likely to contract this quarter and next and in this fiscal year as a whole, according to the July 20-28 poll of nearly 60 economists. Growth had been expected for all of those periods except the second quarter in the previous poll, taken in April.
""India's failure to contain the spread of the coronavirus, and the government's underwhelming support package for firms and households, means the economy will suffer its largest drop in output on record this year,"" said Darren Aw, Asia economist at Capital Economics in Singapore.
In the quarter just gone by, the Indian economy is forecast to have shrunk 20.0% - the first double-digit contraction since official quarterly data started being released in the mid-1990s. It will then contract 6.0% and 0.3% in the current and following quarters, respectively, according to the poll.
That compared to a -5.2% forecast for the last quarter in the April 23 poll, followed by 0.8% and 4.2% growth in the current and next quarters, respectively.
(GRAPHIC - Reuters Poll: India economic outlook: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/rlgvdnnrdvo/Reuters%20Poll%20-%20India%20economy%20DS.PNG) 
For the current fiscal year, Asia's third-largest economy is forecast to shrink 5.1%, a complete turnaround from the 1.5% growth predicted in the previous poll. It would be the weakest performance since 1979.
Under a worst-case scenario, the economy is forecast to have contracted 30.0% in the April-June quarter, and to shrink 10.0%, 4.0% and 9.1% in the current and next quarters and this fiscal year, respectively.
""The health crisis is yet to be addressed and is spreading geographically, which has led to re-initiation of lockdowns and restrictions in many parts of the country,"" said Prithviraj Srinivas, chief economist at  Axis Capital  (NYSE:AXS) in Mumbai.
""With the health crisis yet to be contained, we cannot hope for a smooth recovery.""
When asked how long would it take for India's gross domestic product to reach pre-COVID-19 levels, a slight majority of economists, 23 of 44, said within two years.
Only seven respondents predicted it would happen within a year, while the remaining 14 said it would take two years or more.

Inflation is expected to average 4.5% this fiscal year, and the RBI is forecast to cut the repo rate by another 25 basis points at its Aug. 4-6 meeting, and once more next quarter, to a record low of 3.50%.
The RBI has already reduced the repo rate by a total of 115 basis points since February, and 135 basis points in an easing cycle last year, from 6.50%, responding to an economy that was already slowing. 
In response to an additional question, over three-quarters of 45 economists said the strength of the recovery had worsened or at best stayed the same over the last month.
""The government is the only catalyst at this moment to be able to spur growth and mitigate the COVID-19 crisis,"" said Hugo Erken, head of international economics at Rabobank.

""Fiscal policy is there to fill in the gap left by an absence of domestic demand from the private sector, which we saw over Q2. Basically the private sector was locked up for two months, but the government hasn't stepped up in any way that could have helped cover this gap.""

1575,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 11:45PM ET</span>","U.S. lawmakers, Bank of America press small business agency to fix PPP lending data","By Michelle Price, Chris Prentice and Koh Gui Qing
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bank of America Inc (N:BAC), the second-largest U.S. lender, has asked the Trump administration to correct data meant to offer public accountability on the recipients of $520 billion in pandemic aid designed to preserve jobs, and a group of U.S. Democratic lawmakers has written to demand action before more funds are distributed. The 30 lawmakers outlined a series of ""grave concerns"" about errors in the data for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) in a letter on Monday to the Small Business Administration, asking that the agency ""rectify these issues promptly,"" according to a copy of the letter viewed by Reuters.
Bank of America, which processed 334,761 PPP loans as of June 30, which the SBA said made it the largest PPP lender by volume, has asked the SBA to pull the data, clean it up and re-issue it, according to the person with direct knowledge of the discussions. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment.
The requests, not previously reported, will likely increase pressure on the SBA and the Treasury to explain how they put together lending data on the Paycheck Protection Program, which was designed to help businesses keep workers on their payrolls by issuing forgivable loans.
President Donald Trump's re-election campaign has pointed to the data as showing that his administration protected 51 million American jobs after COVID-19 ruptured the economy.
Released on July 6 after some initial resistance by the Trump administration, the data was meant to let American taxpayers see exactly who got cash -- boosting transparency and allowing policymakers to assess the program's success.
""We have found much of the released data to be grossly incorrect,"" the lawmakers, who included the chair of the House of Representatives Committee on Small Business, wrote in a letter sent to SBA administrator Jovita Carranza on Monday.
""Data covering the number of jobs retained per loan and the borrower’s congressional district has proved to be largely erroneous, casting shadows on the veracity, quality, and reliability of other loan data,"" they wrote.
The lawmakers asked the SBA to address a series of items -- including how it arrived at the ""jobs retained"" figure and whether the SBA made efforts to independently verify data.
Democratic Representative Jason Crow, a member of the committee who led the drafting of the letter, told Reuters in an interview that he was also seeking a meeting with SBA staff to discuss their process and timeframe for cleaning up the data.
“Time is of the essence,” he added, noting that Congress was aiming to authorize a new tranche of PPP funds in coming weeks.
A spokesman for the SBA did not immediately provide comment on Tuesday, but Carranza said during a hearing this month that she was willing to address errors.
Reuters and other news outlets have reported numerous red flags throughout the massive data set that suggest the number of jobs salvaged by PPP aid has been overstated.

Errors identified by Reuters included loans which lenders and borrowers say were neither sought nor approved; loans which were canceled prior to July; and dramatically inflated loan amounts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The internal watchdog at the U.S. government agency responsible for managing COVID-19 emergency loans and grants to small business owners and nonprofits said it has found ""strong indicators of widespread potential fraud"" in the disaster loan program.
The Office of the Inspector General at the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) said it has been ""inundated"" with contacts to investigative field offices, receiving complaints of more than 5,000 instances of suspected fraud from financial institutions receiving economic injury loan deposits through the Economic Injury Disaster Loan and Advance grant programs, according to a public memo on Tuesday.
The emergency loan program, which is separate from the Paycheck Protection Program also administered by the SBA, is designed to provide economic relief to businesses experiencing a hit to revenues. The larger and more high-profile $660-billion PPP has struggled with technology and paperwork issues that led some businesses to miss out while some affluent firms got funds
SBA inspectors have launched numerous investigations into reports of suspected fraud in the disaster loan program, the memo from SBA Inspector General Hannibal ""Mike"" Ware to SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza said.
Nine financial institutions have reported a total of $187.3 million in suspected fraudulent transactions. The suspicious activity included use of stolen identities, attempts to transfer funds into foreign accounts or investment accounts, and deposits into personal accounts with no evidence of business activity, the memo said.
OIG's review also found indications of internal control deficiencies. SBA approved more than $250 million in COVID-19 economic injury loans and grants to potentially ineligible businesses as of June 19 and had made duplicate loans to nearly 300 business, the memo said.
SBA management has taken steps to address the concerns, the memo said.
An agency spokesperson said in an emailed statement the SBA initiated safeguards that prevented processing thousands of invalid applications, ""balancing the Agency’s fiduciary responsibilities against the urgent need to provide the small business sector with more than $184 billion it needed to weather the precipitous challenges created by this pandemic.""

Patrick Wilson started his new role as vice president of government affairs on Monday, amid growing scrutiny of the chip sector in Washington, the person said.
Until Friday, he served as director of the Office of Business Liaison for the Commerce Department, as it led the charge against Chinese tech companies such as telecoms equipment giant Huawei and video surveillance company Hikvision amid rising tensions between Beijing and Washington.
Wilson ""will help advise MediaTek and add our voice to the dialogue about important issues that will guide and grow the semiconductor industry globally,” said MediaTek general counsel David Su, according to a draft press release seen by Reuters.
Neither Commerce nor MediaTek responded to requests for comment.
MediaTek could benefit from a measure imposed by Commerce in May that expands U.S. authority to block global shipments of semiconductor chips to Huawei by requiring companies that manufacture chips designed by it to obtain U.S. licenses. Many industry insiders speculate that Huawei will respond to the rule by outsourcing the design of its chips to companies such as MediaTek.
Wilson previously worked as director of government affairs at the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Euro zone economic growth next year will be slightly stronger than previously thought, according to a Reuters poll of forecasters taken after European Union leaders agreed on 750 billion euros to support economies ravaged by the coronavirus.
But economists surveyed July 22-28 also concluded it would take two or more years for euro zone gross domestic product to reach pre-COVID-19 levels, despite trillions of euros of stimulus from the European Central Bank and governments.
The deal, which was not unexpected but was decided earlier than many analysts had anticipated, will bring the EU to the capital markets as a borrower for the first time. But that economic stimulus won't be felt until 2021.
About three-quarters of economists, or 29 of 38, said their confidence around the prospects for euro zone economies from next year onward had improved, including three who said it had significantly improved. But for now, they only marginally upgraded their growth forecasts.
""While the size of the fund is not large enough to be a game changer from a macroeconomic perspective, common issuance of this magnitude of debt is a historic step for Europe and represents a pivotal change in the way the EU tackles crises,"" said Angel Talavera, head of European economics at Oxford Economics.

Despite a surge of new infections in Spain, an early epicentre of the pandemic that has prompted fears of a second wave of infections, the region has emerged from stringent lockdowns after having handled the pandemic better than the United States.
However, nearly 70% of respondents to an extra question, or 26 of 38 economists, said it would take at least two years for euro zone GDP to reach pre-COVID-19 levels. Not one said it would take less than a year.
The wider Reuters poll of around nearly 60 forecasters predicted the economy would shrink 8.0% in 2020, the worst year since the single currency was launched. That will be followed by a 5.5% expansion in 2021, unchanged from the previous poll.
The latest poll showed GDP shrinking 11.8% this quarter compared with the first three months of the year, better than the 12.2% contraction forecast a week ago. It is then forecast to grow at 8.1% in the current quarter and 2.8% in the next compared with 8.3% and 3.1% earlier.
In 2021, the economy is predicted to expand 1.4% in the first quarter, unchanged from the previous poll, followed by 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.6% in the second, third and fourth quarters, slightly better than median predictions for growth at 1.0%, 0.6% and 0.6% made just before the deal was agreed.
""Given the size and extent of the shock, it (the EU stimulus) can only smooth things out, not completely cancel any of the negative factors,"" said Yvan Mamalet, senior euro area economist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
""We will probably see some second-round effects like an increasing unemployment rate and corporate defaults when it becomes clear that some of the demand will never be recovered.""

The outlook for Italy, among the hardest-hit by the pandemic, was substantially brighter than in April, and is expected to grow 6.2% in 2021, up from previous predictions for an expansion of 5.0%.

As with most developed economies, the outlook for inflation has barely moved in recent months, expected to remain low. ECB rates are forecast to remain unchanged for several years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans' $1 trillion coronavirus relief proposal proposes billions of dollars for the military, including hundreds of millions to restore funding shifted from the Defense Department to pay for President Donald Trump's Mexican border wall.
Trump has made strict controls on immigration a signature issue of his presidency, and fight for re-election in November. To fund the wall he has promised to build on the border with Mexico, the Republican declared a national emergency to redirect funds from the Pentagon to the project.
Republicans and Democrats both objected, but were unable to gather enough votes to override Trump's veto of a bill to stop it.
The $1 trillion plan Republicans announced on Monday provided $30 billion for the Department of Defense, including hundreds of millions of dollars that Democrats rejected as a bid to ""backfill"" accounts the Trump administration had emptied to help pay for the border wall.
For example, the Republican proposal includes $260 million for the Expeditionary Fast Transport ship program, from which the Trump administration shifted $261 million as it reprogrammed funds to pay for the wall.
""It is ... no secret that earlier this year the Trump Administration abused the reprogramming authority to divert funding from military equipment and modernization accounts to pay for the President’s vanity wall,"" Democratic Representative Adam Smith, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said in a statement.
""Now, Republican Senators are trying to capitalize on the urgency of the moment to backfill these accounts while in the same breath arguing that unemployment benefits should be cut in the name of fiscal responsibility."" 

Republicans defended the funding as necessary to support major employers like  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, as the country struggles to recover from the pandemic.

Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, said the bill ""dramatically missed the mark"" for cities, which are dealing with big budget holes and sinking economies while being on the frontline of the virus battle. Whaley, who was among mayors who spoke with reporters on a conference call sponsored by the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities, called for ""a real national strategy"" that would give cities direct and flexible funding.
""Whether Democratic, Republican or independent, coastal or inland, everyone is struggling to meet the needs of residents and fight this pandemic with drastically dwindling resources,"" Whaley said.
The bill unveiled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday does not include any new money for fiscally ailing states and local governments, whose revenues have been hit by plunging sales tax and income tax collection. 
The bill, which Democrats have criticized as inadequate, would allow the governments to replace lost revenue with a slice of the $150 billion earmarked for their coronavirus expenses under the CARES Act, which was enacted in March. Only 25% of the money would be eligible and could not be used to fund pension or other retirement benefits or to replenish rainy day funds.
The mayors said CARES Act money went directly to states and has not for the most part trickled down to cities. 
Van Johnson, the mayor of Savannah, Georgia, said new, ""robust funding"" was needed to stave off economic ruin. 
""Flexibility for previously allocated CARES Act funding is just a drop in the bucket. We are looking for a full pail of water,"" he said.

1584,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>",UK pension scams under scrutiny after 2015 relaxation in rules,"LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers said on Tuesday they were launching an inquiry into pension scams following a relaxation in pension rules five years ago that has increased the scope for fraud, a problem likely to get worse during the coronavirus pandemic.
Under so-called pension freedoms introduced in 2015, over-55s have been able to choose how they spend their pension pots, rather than being forced to buy an annuity, which gives a fixed income for life.
Industry sources say the changes have encouraged investment in other financial products that offer higher returns than annuities, but have also increased the scope for scams.
""More flexibility means more potential for the unscrupulous to take advantage and scam savers out of what will very often be their largest financial asset, crippling their dreams of a comfortable retirement,"" said Stephen Timms, chair of the work and pensions committee of lawmakers.
Some 180 people reported they had been the victim of a pension scam in 2018, losing on average 82,000 pounds ($106,000) each. Regulators believe only a minority of pension scams are reported, the committee said in a statement.
The coronavirus pandemic is likely to lead to a further increase in scams, said Andy Agathangelou, founder of Transparency Task Force, which lobbies for reform of financial services.
""People are suffering from lack of money, there's an increasing lack of confidence in the pensions industry and scammers are getting ever more sophisticated.""
The work and pensions committee is seeking written submissions on pension scams by Sept. 9.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia posted a deficit of 109.2 billion riyals ($29.12 billion) in the second quarter this year as low oil prices hurt revenues, a finance ministry report published on Tuesday showed.
The coronavirus crisis has hurt the non-oil sectors of the world's largest oil exporter this year, adding to the impact of historic price lows on the economy.
Second quarter oil revenues fell by 45% year-on-year to $25.5 billion. Total revenues dropped 49% to nearly $36 billion.
Total second-quarter expenditures dropped annually by 17% to around $65 billion, the report on quarterly budget performance showed, although spending increased when compared to Q1 by 7.5%.
""A pullback in spending is essential for containing the deficit,"" said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. ""The proactive stance of the government was already reflected in the austerity measures announced in April. However, these will dampen the recovery outlook,"" she said.
Facing deep recession this year, Riyadh has introduced steps such as removing a cost-of-living allowance for state employees and tripling value-added tax to 15% to bolster state revenues.
Economists have said this could restrict recovery as curbs aimed at reducing the spread of the cornavirus are lifted.
RESERVES
The IMF has estimated the economy could shrink by 6.8% this year, a figure Saudi officials have said was ""pessimistic"".
Saudi Arabia, which in the first three months of 2020 posted a $9 billion deficit, has raised $12 billion in international markets so far this year and has borrowed 41.1 billion riyals ($10.96 billion) in the domestic market, the document showed.
Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said this month the kingdom plans to tap international debt investors at least once more this year.
In addition to borrowing, the government has used around $13 billion in government reserves in the second quarter to finance its deficit, budget data showed. That is largely within a $32 billion drawdown limit targeted by the government this year.

Between March and April, however, the kingdom used $40 billion in foreign reserves to back overseas investments of its sovereign fund, the Public Investment Fund.

1586,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>","Extend UK furlough scheme or risk wave of joblessness, think tank warns","By Andy Bruce and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Rishi Sunak should extend the government's job retention scheme until the middle of next year to stop a surge in unemployment to levels not seen since the early 1990s, a top think tank said on Tuesday.
The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said the furlough programme for workers at companies hit by the coronavirus outbreak should run until June 2021. It is due to wind down at the end of October. 
""The planned closure of the furlough seems to be a mistake, motivated by an understandable desire to limit spending,"" NIESR deputy director Garry Young said. 
""The scheme was intended by the Chancellor to be a bridge through the crisis and there is a risk that it is coming to an end prematurely and this increases the probability of economic scarring.""
Earlier this month Sunak said calls for an endless extension to the furlough programme were ""irresponsible"" and brought in a scheme to pay employers 1,000 pounds for each worker they retain following furlough.
Sunak's deputy, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay, said on Tuesday that extra ""targeted measures"" to help workers in especially hard-hit sectors were possible but a further wholescale extension was not. 
Spending on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which has supported 9.5 million jobs and is the costliest single government COVID relief measure, has reached 31.7 billion pounds ($41 billion) so far. 
NIESR said unemployment looks set to rise to almost 10% of the workforce by the end of this year if the furlough scheme shuts as planned - similar to forecasts from the Bank of England and the government's own budget watchdog.
By contrast, extending the scheme into 2021 would be ""relatively inexpensive"", preventing a rise in joblessness and might pay for itself if it prevented people becoming unemployed long-term, NIESR said.
But Barclay said at an event hosted by a centre-right think tank, Onward, that workers were likely to lose their skills and fail to develop new ones if they spent more than eight months on leave, waiting for jobs that might never come back. 
""The rationale behind the furlough scheme was about maintaining the link with the job. And actually if you stretch the elastic of that too long... it is not good for them, never mind the debate on the financial side of it.""

1589,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 10:36AM ET</span>",U.S. Consumer Confidence Fell in July as Expectations Slumped,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer confidence declined in July by more than forecast as a pickup in Covid-19 cases rattled Americans’ sentiment about prospects for the economy and the job market.
The Conference Board’s index decreased to 92.6 from a revised 98.3, according to a report issued Tuesday. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a reading of 95 in July. The group’s gauge of expectations fell by the most since March, while household sentiment about current conditions climbed.
The latest reading of sentiment adds to evidence that the pace of economic recovery from the pandemic is cooling as the virus interrupts reopenings in several states. Less than a third of respondents in the survey said they expected better business conditions and more jobs in the next six months, evidenced by an elevated number of Americans collecting jobless benefits.
“Looking ahead, consumers have grown less optimistic about the short-term outlook for the economy and labor market and remain subdued about their financial prospects,” Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement. “Such uncertainty about the short-term future does not bode well for the recovery, nor for consumer spending.”
Confidence deteriorated in California, Texas, Florida and Michigan, the report showed, as the virus spread. Households may also be growing anxious about whether lawmakers will extend benefits such as the extra $600 in weekly unemployment payments that are set to expire in coming days.
Stocks remained lower as traders assessed the latest quarterly earnings.
The subindex of expectations, an indication of short-term outlook on the economy, dropped 14.6 points to 91.5, while attitudes about current conditions climbed to a four-month high of 94.2.
Almost 32% of consumers said they expect better economic conditions six months from now, down from 42.4% a month earlier. Less than 31% see more job availability, compared with 38.4% in June. Income expectations, however, remained relatively stable.
Consumers’ plans to purchases autos and appliances decreased in July, while the share expecting to buy a house rose to a one-year high.
The Conference Board’s figures mirror the University of Michigan’s gauge of sentiment, issued July 17, that also showed households anticipate more economic harm to come from the pandemic.

The extensions apply to those facilities that were due to expire on or around Sept. 30, the Fed said in a statement.
""The three-month extension will facilitate planning by potential facility participants and provide certainty that the facilities will continue to be available to help the economy recover,"" the Fed said.
Hopes for a quick recovery have been dashed as the United States continues to struggle to contain the virus. A resurgence in new cases has forced some authorities in the hard-hit South and West regions to close businesses again or halt reopenings.
The U.S. central bank said the extensions apply to the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility, and Main Street Lending Program.
All are designed to keep credit flowing to businesses and households and stave off long-term harm to the economy. Tens of millions are still out of work and fears are growing that the situation could worsen again as relief programs reach their initially scheduled end.
Expanded unemployment benefits for millions of workers are set to expire this week. Republicans and Democrats in Congress are still negotiating a new aid package to extend them, with another round of direct payments to Americans and more loans to help small businesses also being considered. 

Two other Fed programs have a longer timeline. The Municipal Liquidity Facility is set to expire on Dec. 31, and the Commercial Paper Funding Facility on March 17, 2021.

PARIS (Reuters) - Global airlines cut their coronavirus recovery forecast on Tuesday, saying it would take until 2024 - a year longer than previously expected - for passenger traffic to return to pre-crisis levels.
In an update on the pandemic's crippling impact on air travel, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) cited slow virus containment in the United States and developing countries, and a weaker outlook for corporate travel.
Lingering travel barriers and new restrictions in some markets are also weighing on nearer-term prospects, IATA said, cutting its 2020 passenger numbers forecast to a 55% decline - sharper than the 46% drop predicted in April.
""The second half of this year will see a slower recovery than we'd hoped,"" IATA Chief Economist Brian Pearce said. June passenger numbers were down 86.5% year-on-year, the organisation said, after a 91% contraction in May.
A surprise move by Britain to quarantine arrivals from Spain has created lot of uncertainty, Pearce said. ""That is clearly going to be an issue with the recovery.""
Recovery prospects are weakened by the spread of COVID-19 in the United States and developing countries together representing 40% of global air travel, IATA said.
Business travel may also face a sustained slump, threatening the profitability of long-haul airlines and routes as corporate clients rein in spending and make greater use of video-conferences that have become the norm during lockdowns.
""It will remain to be seen whether we see a recovery to pre-crisis business travel patterns,"" Pearce said. ""Our concern is that we won't.""
Long-haul carriers may need to rely more heavily on cargo to maintain the viability of some routes because of lower business demand, he said.

""For many network airlines, the premium-paying passengers were essentially the ones who drove the profitability.""

DETROIT (Reuters) - Americans are hanging on to their cars and trucks longer, pushing the average age of vehicles on the road to the highest level in nearly 20 years even before the coronavirus hit, according to new data from IHS  Markit Ltd  (N:INFO). 
That is not good for emissions or safety, but it could give a lift to companies that manufacture and sell repair parts.
IHS Markit, which gathers and analyzes data on a wide range of industries, said the average age of cars, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks rose to 11.9 years as of January 2020 from 11.8 years for the prior year.
Graphic: Average age of light vehicles in the U.S. - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-AUTO/AGE/qmyvmkkbbvr/
Data for the period since the coronavirus pandemic hit the global economy are not final, but the sharp slowdown in vehicle sales is likely to push the average age of vehicles on U.S. roads over 12 years, said Todd Campau, associate director of aftermarket solutions for IHS Markit.
""We definitely expect to eclipse the 12-year barrier,"" he said. People working from home could put fewer miles on vehicles, allowing them to last longer, he said.
The average age of cars and light trucks has been increasing steadily for nearly 20 years, reflecting rising prices for new vehicles and improved durability that allows older vehicles to travel more miles with more owners before they are scrapped, Campau said.
The aging U.S. vehicle fleet has been an issue as U.S. lawmakers have debated economic stimulus plans. Proposals to provide government-funded incentives to retire older, more polluting vehicles, or encourage drivers to get new vehicles with more advanced safety technology have so far not gained much traction.

Manufacturers of repair parts and vehicle repair shops should benefit from America's aging and expanding vehicle fleet, IHS Markit forecast. The United States has more than 280 million vehicles on the road.

1595,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 06:39AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Tuesday, July 28th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Senate Republicans propose a $1 trillion package of support measures that will cut the level of unemployment benefit support by two-thirds from October. It's raining earnings, with big updates due from the pharma and consumer sector, as well as from chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). There are U.S. data due on house prices and consumer sentiment. And the European Central Bank told eurozone banks not to pay dividends for the rest of the year, warning them that they need to strengthen their balance sheets against a looming wave of bankruptcies and non-performing loans. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, July 28th.
1. Republicans present stimulus plans
Senate Republicans unveiled a package of economic support bills worth an estimated $1 trillion that would cut the federal subsidy for unemployment benefits by two-thirds from the end of September. Thereafter, the payments would be combined with state benefits to replace 70% of lost wages.
The package reflects Republican concerns that the current weekly checks of $600 per week disincentivize Americans returning to work (and costs a lot of money too – an estimated $15 billion a week).
Democratic Party politicians, who control the House of Representatives, criticised the move as removing a vital support for over 16 million people currently claiming unemployment benefits.
The two parties have until the end of the week to thrash out a compromise. A bill passed in the House approved a much larger $3.5 trillion package of measures, including $900 billion of support for state and municipal governments that is lacking from the Republican package.
2. Fed meeting starts; consumer sentiment data due
The Federal Reserve’s two-day Federal Open Markets Committee meeting starts, but the results will not be known until Wednesday. Rhetoric ahead of the meeting has raised expectations that the Fed could offer clearer guidance of an intention to ease monetary policy further in the future, although no fresh actions are expected at this week’s meeting.
In the meantime, there are house price data from S&P/Case Shiller at 7 AM ET, the Conference Board’s consumer sentiment index at 8 AM and the Richmond Fed’s regional business survey also at 8 AM.
Data out of Europe earlier were marginally better than expected, with Spain’s jobless numbers rising less than feared and a sharper-than-expected rebound in the U.K.’s distributive trades survey.
The euro held on to most of its recent gains to trade at $1.1729.
3. Stocks set to open lower as earnings rain in
Don’t blink or you’ll miss them. It’s raining earnings Tuesday, with updates from (deep breath) Visa (NYSE:V), McDonald’s,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Amgen, Raytheon, Starbucks, Mondelez, Altria, (NYSE:MO), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Advanced Micro Devices  - to name but a few.
Most of those are due after the closing bell but McDonald’s, 3M  and Pfizer will be out early.
The updates will be hitting a stock market struggling for direction, with many CEOs having cast doubt on the sustainability of the recovery in their conference calls.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 87 points or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 futures contract and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract were both down in parallel.
4.  Moderna 's and Pfizer's stage 3 drug trials start
Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) announced the start of the third and final stage of trials for its experimental drug for treating the Covid-19 virus.
Pfizer and its German partner, Nasdaq-listed  Biontech Se  (NASDAQ:BNTX), also said they would start a hybrid stage 2/stage 3 trial for their candidate vaccine.
The rapid progress in vaccine development  - albeit progress that has no guarantee of ultimate success – comes at a time when the number of new infections globally is running at a record high. The rate of new infections in the U.S. appears to have slowed somewhat in response to a tightening of regulations across the south and west of the country, the number of new cases dropping to 56,336 on Monday, after running well over 60,000 last week.
Germany’s top public health official also sounded the alarm over a rise in cases in Europe’s largest economy, which he linked to a loss of discipline in observing social distancing rules.
5. ECB warns banks against dividends 
The European Central Bank told eurozone banks not to pay dividends for the rest of the year, but rather to hoard their cash to strengthen defenses against an expected wave of bankruptcies.
At the same time, the ECB cut the banks further slack on recognizing loan losses, saying it wouldn’t tighten supervisory standards on liquidity and capital until  the end of 2022 at the earliest. The ECB is  determined not to turn an expected economic crisis into a financial one so soon after the last wave of eurozone banking.problems
Eurozone bank stocks rose an average of 0.6%, with the biggest rises seen in Spain, whose banks may need capital relief more than most given the risk to its large tourist sector from the recent rise in Covid-19 cases."

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2020 04:15AM ET</span>","ECB extends dividend ban, capital relief for euro zone banks","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank extended on Tuesday a recommendation to euro zone banks not to pay dividends until the end of the year and allowed them to eat into their capital and liquidity buffers for even longer, to help them cope with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.
The ECB said banks could withstand a second wave of infections, but it called on authorities to be ready to intervene and prevent a credit crunch, possibly including recapitalisations. 
The euro zone's top supervisor extended a ban on dividends and share buybacks by two months until Jan. 1 and recommended that banks ""exercise extreme moderation"" with bonuses. It will review the decisions in the fourth quarter of the year.
It also allowed them to breach their required liquidity buffer until the end of next year and their total capital requirement for another year. 
""All our supervisory measures and actions are and will continue to be aimed at ensuring that the banking sector can remain resilient and support the economic recovery with an adequate supply of credit,"" the ECB's chief supervisor, Andrea Enria, said in a blog post accompanying the decisions.
The ECB's announcement came the same day the Bank of England said it would assess whether to extend a suspension on payouts such as dividends and share buybacks by banks beyond the end of the year. Banks agreed in March to suspend payouts this year.
In a ""vulnerability analysis"", the ECB found that in its central economic scenario, which assumes containment measures until mid-2021, banks would see their aggregate Core Equity Tier 1 capital ratio depleted by approximately 1.9 percentage points to 12.6% by the end of 2022.
The severe scenario, which foresees a strong resurgence of infections, would wipe 5.7 percentage points off their capital to 8.8% over the same period.
""There is clearly no room for complacency, but we can take some comfort,"" Enria said. ""This being said, the outcome of the exercise also indicates that authorities must be ready to take additional action if the economic situation further deteriorates.""
In a conference call after the decision, Enria added that government could, if the severe scenario came to pass, extend existing measures to support borrowers but also introduce ""asset relief schemes"" or even recapitalise banks directly. 

Undoing a decision taken at the height of the first wave of the outbreak in the spring, the ECB decided to resume inspections at banks, starting in October, and to follow up on remedial action that has already been agreed.

Under pressure from the central bank, Britain's lenders agreed in March to suspend payouts this year in order to preserve capital to help companies and households hit by COVID-19 lockdowns. Bonuses to senior staff were also scrapped.
The Bank of England (BoE) said on Tuesday its Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulation Authority (PRA) would undertake in the fourth quarter an assessment of distribution plans at banks beyond the end of 2020.
""The assessment will be based on the current and projected capital positions of the banks and will take into account the level of uncertainty about the future path of the economy, market conditions and capital trajectories prevailing at that time,"" the BoE said in a statement.
Britain's lenders are due to publish second quarter earnings that are expected to show more hefty provisions for loans hit by fallout from the pandemic.
The BoE said payouts were an important and necessary part of the functioning of the banking system, but that suspending them was a ""sensible precautionary step given the unique role of banks in supporting the wider economy through the period of economic disruption"".
Separately on Tuesday, the European Central Bank said it had extended until January 2021 its recommendation to euro zone lenders not to pay dividends.

The former ruling Social Democrats, parliament's biggest party, spearheaded a bill that doubles state subsidies for schoolchildren, piling pressure on a cabinet already grappling with the economic fallout from the novel coronavirus epidemic.
""It is a bill without a funding source,"" Citu told private television station Realitatea Plus late on Monday. 
""The prime minister will announce (by how much child benefits will rise). It is around 15%, but we will not stop here, we will have another hike in January.""
Citu said the smaller hike could be approved through a government decree later this week.
Even before the pandemic, Romania was struggling with a rising budget deficit, and a 40% pension hike effective Sept. 1, also approved last year by the previous government, has prompted warnings of credit rating downgrades.
The government also plans to raise pensions by a smaller percentage through a decree in mid-August.

The government has estimated the budget deficit will jump to 6.7% of gross domestic product this year while the economy will contract by 1.9%. All three major credit agencies have Romania on their lowest investment grade with negative outlooks.

The National Green Development Fund will mainly be used to invest in national strategic programmes such as the green development of the Yangtze river region, said Zou Shoumin, a director responsible for finance at China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE).
The fund was formally launched on July 15 by the MEE, the Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai city government. 
It is designed to support the ""green transformation"" of the Chinese economy and strengthen the role of the market in fighting pollution, environment minister Huang Runqiu said at the fund's launch ceremony. 
China has been trying to diversify its funding sources for its environmental programme, but it has struggled to devise new financing mechanisms to help pay the massive costs of cleaning up polluted soil and water.
Over the 2016-2020 period, the central government allocated 78.3 billion yuan to combat water pollution, 97.4 billion yuan on air pollution and 28.5 billion yuan on soil pollution, as well as another 20.6 billion yuan to tackle environmental problems in rural regions, Zou said.

""We hope the central government could continue to invest in these areas during the fourteenth five-year plan (2021-2025), especially anti-air pollution, as we will coordinate the treatment of ozone pollution and PM2.5 at the same time,"" he said.

The ten advanced countries -- covered in its Global Economic Outlook -- showed an average decline in annual potential gross domestic product growth of about 0.6 percentage point compared with Fitch’s previous five-year outlook. U.S. productive potential growth is revised down to 1.4% from 1.9%, the U.K. to 0.9% from 1.6% and the euro zone -- the weighted average of Germany, France, Italy and Spain -- to 0.7% from 1.2%, it said.
“There will be lasting damage to supply-side productive potential from the coronavirus shock as long-term unemployment rises, working hours fall and investment and capital accumulation slow,” Maxime Darmet, a director in Fitch’s economics team, said in a statement.
The world economy entered the second half of 2020 still deeply weighed down by the pandemic. The coronavirus recession is expected to still see GDP levels in the largest advanced economies remain around 3% to 4% below their pre-virus trend path by the middle of this decade, Fitch said.
A weaker outlook for capital accumulation accounts for about half of the revision to potential growth, the ratings agency said. The remainder is explained by the anticipated reduction in labor as unemployment rises and average hours worked fall, according to Fitch.
Cuts to estimated potential GDP imply “catch-up” growth over the next five years will be far more subdued. Fitch projects U.S. growth to average just over 2% from 2023 to 2025, compared with more than 3% if no adjustments were made to estimated potential growth.
The credit ratings agency acknowledged that risks around its projections are “very large.” These include the path of the health crisis, as well as the potential for fiscal consolidation following the stimulus. Conversely, job-subsidy programs in Europe might prove effective in limiting the rise in unemployment on the continent in the next six to 12 months.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's main creditors said on Monday their latest debt restructuring proposal has support from investors holding more than half the country's foreign debt, bolstering their base for countering the government's most recent offer.
Financial institutions representing 60% of outstanding exchange bonds and 51% of outstanding global bonds have pledged support for a joint proposal submitted to the government by three main creditor groups on July 20, according to a letter by the creditors to Economy Minister Martin Guzman seen by Reuters.
The letter was signed by about 30 investment funds, including those part of the Ad Hoc Bondholder group, the Exchange Bondholder group and the Argentina Creditor Committee.
BlueBay Asset Management LLP, Fidelity Management & Research Co. and Amundi Asset Management were among the other funds who signed.
Argentina is facing a standoff with bondholders over the restructuring of about $65 billion in foreign debt after its creditor groups joined forces to reject the government's proposal earlier in July.
""We are confident that a consensual resolution will provide a path towards even greater and more sustained investment in Argentina's growth sectors,"" the letter said.
A spokesman for Argentina's ministry of economy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The South American country has insisted it will not budge from its ""final offer"" but signaled it would be willing to negotiate on the fine print around the deal.
The two sides have wrangled over collective action clauses (CACs) that determine the requirements for any future changes made to the bond agreements.
Argentina is pushing for enhanced CACs, which allow borrowers to bundle together multiple bonds, making it even harder for minority hold-outs pushing for a better deal to disrupt the process. Enhanced CACs require a single threshold for approval, generally set at 75%.

1608,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 10:30PM ET</span>","Republicans unveil coronavirus plan, slash emergency unemployment benefit","By Susan Cornwell and David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Republicans on Monday proposed a $1 trillion coronavirus aid package hammered out with the White House, paving the way for talks with Democrats on how to help Americans as expanded unemployment benefits for millions of workers expire this week.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the proposal a ""tailored and targeted"" plan focused on getting children back to school and employees back to work and protecting corporations from lawsuits, while slashing the expiring supplemental unemployment benefits of $600 a week by two-thirds.
The plan sparked immediate opposition from both Democrats and Republicans. Democrats decried it as too limited compared to their $3 trillion proposal that passed the House of Representatives in May, while some Republicans called it too expensive.
McConnell said the package would include direct $1,200 payments to Americans, as well as incentives for the manufacture of personal protective equipment in the United States, rather than China. 
It also includes $190 billion for loans to help small businesses, and $100 billion for loans to businesses that operate seasonally or in low-income areas.
Republicans want to reduce the expanded unemployment benefit from the current $600 per week, which is in addition to state unemployment payments and expires on Friday, to $200 in addition to state unemployment.
After two months, states would implement a new formula that replaces about 70% of lost wages. 
The supplemental unemployment has been a financial lifeline for laid-off workers and a key support for consumer spending. The extra funds - exceeding the former wages of some workers - have been a sticking point for many Republicans, who say they encourage Americans to stay home rather than go back to work.
Democrats, in turn, have criticized the Republican delay in writing more legislation as confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases passed the 4 million mark. The pandemic has killed nearly 150,000 people in the United States.
Negotiations started immediately after the Republican package was introduced. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer met for nearly two hours with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. 
Meadows said afterwards that it was a ""good meeting"" and that he and Mnuchin would return to Capitol Hill on Tuesday. But Pelosi and Schumer, speaking to reporters, expressed frustration that items like rental and food assistance had been left out.
""We hope that we would be able to reach an agreement. We clearly do not have shared values. Having said that, we just want to see if we can find some common ground to go forward. But we’re not at that place yet,” Pelosi said.
LIABILITY PROTECTIONS AND DEFENSE SPENDING
The Republican-led Senate refused to consider the House coronavirus relief bill, known as the ""HEROES Act,"" that was passed in May. 
McConnell on Monday called the House bill a ""socialist manifesto"" and urged Democrats to work with Republicans on their plan, the ""HEALS Act."" 
""We have one foot in the pandemic and one foot in the recovery,"" McConnell said. ""The American people need more help. They need it to be comprehensive, and they need it to be carefully tailored to this crossroads."" 
The proposal included ""strong legal liability protection"" for corporations, a top Republican priority.
It includes nearly $30 billion for the military and defense industry, in addition to nearly $760 billion already enacted for defense this year - including more than $10 billion in previous coronavirus relief bills.
Opposition from some of McConnell's fellow Republicans, as well as from Democrats, signaled a tough road ahead.
""The answer to these challenges will not simply be shoveling cash out of Washington. The answer to these challenges will be getting people back to work,"" Republican Senator Ted Cruz told reporters.
Some Republicans had complained about the high price tag. The federal government has already spent $3.7 trillion to cushion the economic blow from pandemic-forced shutdowns. 
Schumer said the Republican plan did too little, too slowly, to help Americans facing joblessness and eviction. ""The Republican plan is weak tea, when our problems need a much stronger brew,"" Schumer said.
He said many states had warned they would have a hard time implementing unemployment changes. Many Americans waited weeks for previous coronavirus benefits, as outmoded state computer systems adjusted.

The Republican proposal also includes measures not directly related to the COVID-19 outbreak, including $1.8 billion for construction of a new FBI headquarters in Washington, something championed by President Donald Trump, who owns a hotel across the street from the current building.

People with outstanding student loans will not have to make payments while they are out of work, Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander said Monday as he introduced the plan. When they return to work, their payments will be capped at 10% of their income after living expenses, such as housing and food, are deducted, he said.
“If you have no income, you have no monthly payment,” Alexander said.
The legislation also would provide need-based grants to centers that have had to close or curtail operations due to the virus. Many childcare facilities have closed their doors permanently because of the pandemic and others may follow. Most of those that remain open are operating at reduced capacity, according to a July 13 survey of 5,000 child care providers by the National Association for the Education of Young Children.
“Child care providers are critical to the recovery of the United States economy by allowing parents to return to work, and by providing safe environments for young children,” according to a summary of the legislation.
The provisions were part of an education-focused bill that is one of several that make up the plan Republicans will be taking into negotiations with Democrats.
The legislation would provide scholarships that can be used by parents who send their children to private schools or by parents who decide they want to send their children to private schools while public schools are closed.
Alexander said the measure would provide about $70 billion for kindergarten through the 12th grade and $30 billion for colleges and universities. That results in about $1,200 per student for public and private schools, according to the plan.
Some of the money is earmarked for schools that reopen classrooms for in-person instruction, which has been a priority of President Donald Trump.

1611,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 06:56PM ET</span>",Japan stirs controversy with huge COVID aid contract for ad giant Dentsu,"By Mari Saito and Ju-min Park
TOKYO (Reuters) - Off a narrow corridor above a store selling Persian rugs in central Tokyo, a small office houses a private operation which won a tender in April to distribute more than $20 billion in government aid to businesses hit by the new coronavirus.
The agency, the Service Design Engineering Council, actually carried out only a fraction of that work, local media reported last month. Service Design was co-founded by Dentsu Group Inc., one of Japan's most influential companies. It passed hundreds of millions of dollars to administer the project back to Dentsu, an advertising and PR company with close ties to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), government documents show. 
Under the arrangement, Service Design won the contract to distribute the $20 billion, but actually took less than 1% of the total $718 million for managing the project and passed on most of the rest to Dentsu, which set up vetting procedures, websites and call centres, the companies and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said.
Dentsu, in turn, subcontracted the work again through its subsidiaries. The ministry has said that there were five tiers of subcontractors and at least 63 companies involved. Officials have disclosed the names of only 14 of those; the government has not fully accounted for contracts worth at least $247 million, about one-third of the total. 
The arrangement led to confusion and delays for small business owners. Members of parliament have questioned how taxpayers' money was spent during a national emergency.
Controversy over the contract - one of the largest that Japan has outsourced from its pandemic budget - is widening for Abe's government, already facing a fall in public support over its handling of the pandemic. Questions are mounting from opposition politicians about the government's links to Dentsu, a publicly listed company. At issue is whether Service Design helped shield Dentsu's leading role from scrutiny. The government and Dentsu have come under fire in the past for their close ties. 
Nearly three million firms have applied for payouts of up to $18,600 each, according to METI, which awarded the contract. Thousands are still waiting to be approved or paid. Some small business owners told Reuters the wait was so long and the payout so small, they had no choice but to fold. 
Service Design is a private, not-for-profit group which does not disclose ownership details and has a staff of 22. Dentsu founded it with Pasona Group Inc, a temporary staffing agency, and Transcosmos Inc, an IT services firm; three of its nine directors and several of its employees are from Dentsu group companies.
The ministry declined to disclose the full list of companies involved because of a clause in Japan's disclosure law. If revealing information about a company could harm the firm's competitive position, it said, it is not obliged to disclose it. 
There are no allegations of illegality in the process.
Opposition politicians blame the subcontracting for administrative costs rising to what one of them, Masayuki Aoyama, said was roughly 30 times more than a similar programme for private individuals that was handled by local governments. They and some frustrated small business owners want to know why the government picked Service Design, and why and to whom the work to distribute the money was then farmed out.
""The whole thing is extremely grey,"" said Kaname Tajima, one of dozens of opposition members of parliament who are campaigning for the ministry to release full details of how the contracts have been handed out.
""What is strange is the government is protecting Dentsu from scrutiny about lack of information and accountability,"" Tajima said.
A poll in June by TV Asahi, a broadcaster, found 73% of respondents thought the government had handled the programme inappropriately.
The economy ministry said that as of July 20, it had received 2.9 million applications from small businesses and distributed funds to 2.67 million; Service Design said that for the most part, funds are being paid out roughly two weeks after an application is received. 
Yusuke Tanaka, the official at the ministry in charge of the payouts programme, said METI conducted a competitive tender and awarded the contract based on a comprehensive rating system. He said the ministry had not given preferential treatment to Service Design and Dentsu. Asked if involving private companies added costs to the project, Tanaka said that applicant vetting, and the cost of providing face-to-face support for the applicants, had lifted administrative costs compared with the scheme for private individuals. 
Service Design, which told Reuters by email it tendered for the project because it had experience with an IT subsidy programme, hired extra staff and found venues to help businesses with their applications, and retained a bank to help process the payments. It said Dentsu was best placed to carry out the ambitious and wide-ranging project. 
Dentsu said the contracting structure was not opaque and that payouts were timely. Administering the project requires various companies and more than 10,000 workers, it said. 
""To begin with, we did not think that it was possible for one company to handle a public project of this level,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters on July 21.
The next day, Dentsu announced on its website that in response to public reaction over its dealings with the government in the small business programme, it was conducting a review of its involvement in such projects. The company said it would not bid on any new contracts from METI until the review was complete.
Transcosmos and Pasona declined to comment. 
TRACK RECORD
Abe told parliament in June the outsourcing had been carried out appropriately. But support for his administration's response to the pandemic fell to 36% on July 20, a Kyodo News poll showed, down from 49% a month ago. 
""There's no question the unclear scheme around the small business relief programme has ... damaged public support over (the government's) handling of the pandemic,"" said Atsuo Ito, an independent political analyst. 
Abe's party, in power in Japan almost continuously since the 1950s, is an important client for Dentsu. Dentsu has done work for the party since the 1950s and 60s, when it was hired to help it campaign in elections, and smooth the passage of an unpopular security treaty with the United States. It was also involved in the 1964 Olympics.
More recently Dentsu, which started as a news agency, has made sports marketing a centrepiece of its business. It served as a marketing agent for Tokyo's bid to host the 2020 Olympics, for which it helped Japan raise a record $3.1 billion in domestic sponsorship. The tournament has been postponed for a year due to the pandemic.
The world's sixth-largest advertising agency, Dentsu also works in public relations, market research and polling. 
The coronavirus aid was meant to help businesses like Takenobu Tonegawa's video production firm, which specialised in corporate events. When cases of COVID-19 surged in spring, most of his clients canceled. The Tokyo-based entrepreneur waited four weeks for his $10,000 cheque from the government, he said.
While he waited, the 41-year old found work delivering food on his bicycle for Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats. Tonegawa said he had rung a call centre operated by one of the companies under Service Design more than 100 times over three days to chase his application. Each time he was referred to a different part-time employee who was not aware of it. It was one of the most stressful periods of his life, Tonegawa said. 
""I don't blame the outsourcing itself, but if they run this system with taxpayers' money, they should've operated it better,"" he said.
PASS THE BUCK
Pictured on national TV as a sparsely furnished office where a handful of employees type at laptops under fluorescent lights, Service Design oversees the entirety of the small business aid project. It coordinates with companies and liaises with the ministry, METI's Tanaka said. 
Service Design competed for the relief contract with Deloitte Tohmatsu Financial Advisory, the ministry said. Deloitte had two meetings with government officials, one of them over the phone. 
Service Design met with ministry officials in person three times and was joined at the meetings by Dentsu officials, the ministry has said, adding that it followed proper procedures. A spokeswoman at Deloitte declined to comment on the process. 
As a non-profit, Service Design is not required to release detailed earnings information. When it tendered for the contract it had not filed the required public records of its assets and liabilities for three years, Japanese media reported. It posted them on its website after the reports, and told Reuters it had not done so before because of an internal communication error. 
The non-profit passed most of the contract to Dentsu, which in turn handed down the work. The largest portion of the subsequent contract went to Dentsu Live, an event production company that is wholly owned by Dentsu, according to the ministry. Dentsu Live further outsourced the work, Service Design said.
Japanese ministries are free to award contracts to bidders who intend to subcontract some of the work, but subcontracting more than 50% of a taxpayer-funded project is not normally advisable, governance experts say, citing standards issued by the finance ministry in 2006 to ensure transparency in public projects.
METI officials have told Reuters that even though Service Design subcontracted a large portion of the awarded funds, it still managed the ""core"" of the project.
Last month, after politicians asked the ministry to explain why Service Design was allowed to outsource so much of its work, it provided heavily redacted bidding documents, which some lawmakers said obfuscated crucial information. The ministry said it could not disclose further details due to competitive concerns.
Dentsu told journalists in June it didn't become the primary contractor for the aid project because it believed Service Design had the necessary track record, and felt recipients of the payouts may be confused if they saw Dentsu was involved in the payments.
Added to this, Dentsu told Reuters in July it had decided not to lead the work itself after its accounting department advised that doing so would ""impact the balance sheet and possibly hinder normal operations."" It did not elaborate. 
The ministry has set up a third-party panel to review how it awards public contracts and make recommendations on increasing transparency, it said.
RUBBLE
By the time hotel owner Yoshiteru Yonezawa's $18,600 stimulus arrived, he had decided to sell out. Going bust would make it hard for him to run another hotel, he said. 
He used the cash to pay severance to around 90 employees of the hotel that his family has run for nearly seven decades in Hokkaido, a region popular for winter sports. 
""What small business owners really want is for any kind of support programme to start as soon as possible,"" said Yonezawa in a tired voice.
The government has said it expects hundreds of thousands more firms to apply for its next round of relief funds. 
It would be too late for Fumiaki Ichiyama. He ran Yonosuke, an old-school bar in Tokyo, for more than 40 years. Decorated with red lanterns and the day's specials written by hand on paper on the walls, the bar was popular with media types.
Before the pandemic, it brought in $4,000 a day in sales, he said. In early April that slumped to $400. He could not afford the rent; the bar manager had had enough. 
A few weeks after the bar closed, workers demolished the building. All that remains is a mound of rubble.

1612,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 05:45PM ET</span>","Mnuchin, Meadows Draw GOP Lawmakers’ Ire in Virus Relief Talks","(Bloomberg) -- Congressional Republicans are growing frustrated with the two Trump administration officials leading stimulus negotiations, saying Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has made too many concessions to Democrats in earlier stimulus talks and that White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is indecisive.
The lawmakers are concerned that Mnuchin gave away too much to Democrats in previous stimulus packages, particularly a blanket $600 a week in unemployment insurance, according to people familiar with the matter. The Republicans say Meadows’s indecision has delayed the process, the people said.
A broader rift between President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers has already delayed introduction of a plan for another $1 trillion in pandemic relief. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had initially said he would release a collection of proposals last week, but that deadline slipped after the GOP failed to reach a consensus.
McConnell unveiled the proposal when the Senate convened Monday. Mnuchin and Meadows are slated to return to the Capitol Monday evening to meet with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to help jump-start talks.
The expanded unemployment benefits that were part of the March economic rescue began running out Saturday, adding urgency to negotiations on the next round of relief. There are signs, including filings for unemployment benefits, that a nascent rebound from pandemic shutdowns is stalling.
McConnell’s legislative package will mark the starting point for negotiations with congressional Democrats, who say McConnell delayed introducing a GOP plan until jobless aid and eviction protections are expiring. Congress has only two weeks before lawmakers are scheduled to leave Washington for an August break.
Republican Disunity
But at the same time, even some Republicans say they can’t back McConnell’s $1 trillion plan, saying the country can’t afford the spending.
The Republican disunity and finger-pointing over the handling of the GOP proposal comes as the party faces the possibility of losing both the White House and the Senate in the November election.
Trump’s approval rating has plummeted as coronavirus cases surge in some states, prompting some to pause or reverse plans to reopen their economies. Americans filed another 1.4 million applications for unemployment insurance under regular state programs in the week ended July 18, more than double the worst week in the 2007-2009 recession.
GOP lawmakers grew unhappy with Mnuchin in April. They said the unemployment insurance measure created a disincentive for Americans to return to work because many were able to collect more from the government program than from their jobs. They also say he gave in too much to Democrats’ demands on paid leave.
McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told White House officials they were displeased with the number of concessions that the Treasury chief made in earlier stimulus negotiations, three of the people said.
“Since Congressman Meadows became White House Chief of Staff, he and Secretary Mnuchin have worked in close coordination as a team, and they review everything with the President daily,” Treasury Department spokeswoman Monica Crowley said.
The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did McConnell or McCarthy’s office.
Pelosi Friction
Republican leaders also don’t want Mnuchin to meet with Pelosi without other White House officials or GOP lawmakers or staff present, the people said. Mnuchin negotiated earlier stimulus deals with Pelosi, maintaining a relationship with her even as she and Trump traded criticism.
But the GOP lawmakers also have grown frustrated with Meadows, saying he strikes deals and then reverses his position, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Though Meadows was a congressman from North Carolina before joining the Trump administration, he was less known for his work on legislation than as leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.
Despite the complaints, both Mnuchin and Meadows have continued to play central roles in negotiating with lawmakers.

1613,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 05:36PM ET</span>",GOP Rolls Out $1 Trillion Stimulus to Start Talks With Democrats,"(Bloomberg) -- Senate Republicans presented their $1 trillion plan to bolster the pandemic-ravaged U.S. economy in a series of bills that would trim extra unemployment benefits, send $1,200 payments to most Americans and shield businesses, schools and other organizations from lawsuits stemming from coronavirus infections.
The $1 trillion package was pulled together after days of negotiations between Senate Republicans and President Donald Trump’s emissaries that didn’t completely settle differences within the GOP over the size and scope of additional federal spending in response to the pandemic.
“We have one foot in the pandemic and one foot in the recovery,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday on the Senate floor, noting the rising death toll and a fragile economic recovery. “The American people need more help, they need it to be comprehensive, and they need it to be carefully tailored to this crossroads.”
The bill introductions are just the first step toward negotiating a compromise plan with Democrats, who’ve offered their own $3.5 trillion stimulus plan. Congress has little time to act: supplemental unemployment insurance is expiring and other elements of the last stimulus legislation are beginning to dry up.
Lawmakers are set to leave for an August break in two weeks and will be facing a timetable compressed by the looming November election when they return in September.
Kicking off negotiations, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer are scheduled to meet in her office with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows Monday evening.
Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said Congress is “chasing a moving target” with stimulus bills.
“I fear Covid will cast a long shadow on the economy and the aid Congress is offering up is too little too late,” Swonk said. “The bankruptcies and failures that will mount could leave us a much smaller and fractured base from which to rebuild.”
Continuing dissent among Republicans makes McConnell’s negotiating position more difficult.
“There is significant resistance to yet another trillion dollars,” Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas told reporters. “As it stands now I think it’s likely that you’ll see a number of Republicans in opposition to this bill and expressing serious concerns.”
There also was a split between the White House and Senate Republicans. Meadows had suggested that Congress pass a much smaller package of school and unemployment benefits and continue negotiating a larger plan through August. McConnell’s statement that the bill had to be comprehensive was a rejection of that position.
Schumer called the GOP effort to put together a package a “slow-motion train wreck” that has delayed getting legislation through Congress.
“They can’t even put one bill together, they are so divided,” he said.
There are some areas of common ground between Democrats and Republicans. Both agree on sending another round of stimulus payments to individuals, though Democrats want to increase the amount paid to dependents and expand eligibility. The Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses is another measure that both parties support and is all but assured will be in the final bill.
Republicans have agreed to extend supplemental unemployment benefits, but they propose cutting supplemental unemployment benefits to $200 weekly from $600 until states are able to create a system that would provide 70% of a laid-off worker’s previous pay up to a state-set cap, according to two people familiar with the plan.
Schumer said tying the payments to actual wages will be “unworkable” for most state unemployment systems, which had trouble distributing the flat $600 payment that was part of the March stimulus bill.
The GOP plan also includes money for virus testing and to help with distribution of an eventual vaccine, as well as aid for schools.
Two of the biggest fights ahead are likely to be over two issues that are key for both sides: Democratic demands for aid to states and a GOP measure that provides protection against lawsuits stemming from coronavirus infections when businesses and schools reopen.

A total of 15% of flights leaving Britain in August last year were destined for the islands, carrying just under 2.4 million people, the Airport Operators Association (AOA) said on Monday.

U.S. Senator Mitt Romney, of Utah, said last week he would also oppose the nomination of Shelton, a former Trump campaign adviser.
Shelton, who in the past has supported a return to the gold standard and advocated the Fed be more in line with Trump's White House regarding monetary policy, was approved last Tuesday by the Senate Banking Committee on a narrow 13-12 party line vote.
For confirmation, she requires approval in the wider Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority. 
At least two more Republicans would need to join Romney and Collins to block Shelton joining the top ranks of economic policymaking at the U.S. central bank.

North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer, who had joined Romney in sinking Trump's proposed nomination last year of former presidential candidate Herman Cain, said last week that he would support Shelton.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Bans on international travel cannot stay in place indefinitely, and countries are going to have to do more to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus within their borders, the World Health Organization said on Monday.
A surge of infections has prompted countries to reimpose some travel restrictions in recent days, with Britain throwing the reopening of Europe's tourism industry into disarray by ordering a quarantine on travellers returning from Spain.
Only with strict adherence to health measures, from wearing masks to avoiding crowds, would the world manage to beat the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said at a virtual news briefing.
""Where these measures are followed, cases go down. Where they are not, cases go up,"" he said, praising Canada, China, Germany and South Korea for controlling outbreaks.
WHO emergencies programme head Mike Ryan said it was impossible for countries to keep borders shut for the foreseeable future.
""...It is going to be almost impossible for individual countries to keep their borders shut for the foreseeable future. Economies have to open up, people have to work, trade has to resume,"" he said.
""What is clear is pressure on the virus pushes the numbers down. Release that pressure and cases creep back up.""
Ryan praised Japan and Australia for having had ""good success in containing the disease"" but said that it was to be expected that the virus would resurge in areas with active transmission if restrictions are lifted and mobility increased.
""And that is what has essentially occurred in many countries is that in nightclubs, other situations, dormitories, other environments in which people are close together can act as amplification points for the disease and then it can spread back into the community. We need to be hyper-alert on those.""
Measures must be consistent and kept in place long enough to ensure their effectiveness and public acceptance, Ryan said, adding that governments investigating clusters should be praised not criticised. 
""What we need to worry about is situations where the problems aren't being surfaced, where the problems are being glossed over, where everything looks good.""
Ryan said Spain's current situation was nowhere near as bad as it had been at the pandemic's peak there, and he expected clusters to be brought under control, though it would take days or weeks to discern the disease's future pattern.

""The more we understand the disease, the more we have a microscope on the virus, the more precise we can be in surgically removing it from our communities,"" he added.

1618,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>",Factbox: What progress is Britain making on post-Brexit trade deals?,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is negotiating several bilateral trade deals to come into effect once its exit from the European Union is complete at the end of the year. 
The Department for International Trade has prioritised deals with the EU, the United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Here's where things stand:
UNITED STATES
Total trade value: 232.7 billion pounds (1)
Both sides have said they want a quick deal, but there are clear hurdles. The United States elects a new president in November, and the UK says there is no set timetable because it does not want time pressure to be used against it.
Two rounds of talks have taken place so far, with the third expected to begin on Monday. Both sides have described the talks as constructive and positive, but there are underlying tensions.
The United States imposed retaliatory tariffs on EU exports, including some from Britain, after a row over aircraft subsidies. Britain has demanded that those tariffs, which apply to a wide range of goods including Scotch whisky and tailored suits, be removed to show goodwill.
Other high-profile issues include whether a deal will give U.S. firms access to Britain's state-funded healthcare system, and whether Britain will accept U.S. food hygiene standards. The British government says the National Health Service is not on the table, and food standards will not be lowered.
EUROPEAN UNION
Total trade value: 673 billion pounds (1)
Britain and the European Union have held six formal rounds of talks on a trade agreement to form part of a deal on their future relationship when a status quo transition period expires at the end of this year.
Both sides agreed last month to speed up their talks but their positions are far apart, particularly on the ""level playing field"" guarantees of fair competition and on fisheries.
Britain said after the last round that an agreement could be reached in September; EU officials say the earliest any breakthrough could come is towards the end of August.
AUSTRALIA
Total trade value: 18.6 billion pounds (1)
Britain said in its negotiating mandate, published on June 17, that it wanted an ambitious and comprehensive deal including a focus on technology, innovation and research and development.
The first round of talks was held remotely between June 29 and July 10. Trade minister Liz Truss said: ""Discussions between negotiators were productive and reflected our shared ambition to secure a comprehensive deal to boost trade and investment between our like-minded economies.""
The next round of talks is planned for September.
JAPAN
Total trade value: 31.6 billion pounds (1)
Negotiations began in June. Both sides have said they want a deal to come into force by the end of 2020.
Tokyo wanted to conclude talks by the end of July, but Truss has since said she will not be bounced into signing a deal because of time pressure.
Britain says any deal with Japan should be at least as good as the one signed with the EU, and that that deal can be used as a template to speed the process up. 
British analysis estimated that, in the long run, the trade deal could  increase annual trade flows between  both countries by 15.2 billion pounds and increase the size of the UK economy by  1.5 billion pounds.
NEW ZEALAND
Total trade value: 2.9 billion pounds (1)
Britain said in its negotiating mandate, published on June 17, that it wanted an ambitious and comprehensive deal supporting both governments' 'Net Zero' commitments on climate change.
The first round of trade talks began via videoconference on July 13 and concluded on July 24. Further rounds are expected in due course, Britain said.

1619,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 10:15AM ET</span>","RV shipments surge as Americans opt to carry home with them to avoid airports, hotels","By Timothy Aeppel
(Reuters) - Call it the turtle solution to wanderlust in the age of COVID-19.
Eager to travel - but wary of hotels, airplanes and restaurants - more Americans are taking their homes with them everywhere they go, reviving a recreational vehicle business that had been devastated by shutdowns earlier this year.
Wholesale shipments of RVs posted their highest monthly total in June since October 2018, according to the RV Industry Association, the industry's main trade group, marking a sharp reversal after months of deeply depressed business. In data provided to Reuters, the group tallied 40,462 units shipped last month, a 10.8% increase over a year ago.
By contrast, shipments in April were down more than 82% from a year ago and down nearly 30% in May.
""We didn’t anticipate this turn being as strong as it has been,"" said Craig Kirby (NYSE:KEX), the group's president. ""People don't want to fly, they don't want to stay in a hotel. In an RV, you can cook your own meals and sleep in your own bed.""
Kirby said his group expects more people to start using RVs as mobile offices as well. Some manufacturers are developing RVs ""with dedicated workspaces that allow for the desks and other systems to be stowed away once work is over,"" he said.
One indication that the upturn is a response to the pandemic is the large number of first-time buyers, Kirby said. Surveys of RV dealers indicate most buyers, between 50% to 80%, depending on location, are first-time purchasers. A year ago, that share ranged between 25% and 35%. RVs are also attracting more younger buyers.
While shipments are strong, the mix of RVs is heavier on towable and smaller motorhome models, rather than often much-pricier big motorhomes. Shipments of towable RVs was up nearly 13% last month.
Major players in the industry also have flagged the turnaround.
""We have seen an incredible rebound in retail demand and dealer demand since early May across all our businesses,"" Winnebago Industries (NYSE:WGO) Inc Chief Executive Michael Happe said on a conference call last month.

Investors have cottoned onto the trend, too. Winnebago shares are up nearly 11% this year versus a 2.4% decline for the S&P 500. Shares of rival  Thor Industries  (NYSE:THO) Inc. are doing even better, gaining 38% this year.

1620,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 08:09AM ET</span>",World’s Rising Stock of Sub-Zero Debt Has Investors Adding Risk,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s pile of debt with a negative yield -- bonds that cost investors money simply by holding them -- has climbed to near the $15 trillion mark, prompting investors to take on more risk.
Potential returns across the bond market have become increasingly scarce, following the coronavirus crisis and asset purchases by central banks. While still short of a $17 trillion peak last year, the mountain of negative-yielding debt is set to climb for a fourth month, matching 2019’s record streak, according to Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) indices.
“Investors are desperately trying to find yield somewhere,” said Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Nordea Bank Abp (OTC:NRDBY). “At times there are reminders of the risks involved, but it seems in the current environment such news is merely a temporary setback in the bigger picture of contracting risk premia.”
Europe is at the heart of the phenomenon, with the rate on all of Germany’s bonds below 0%, and now even some of Italy’s, considered among the region’s riskiest. Those on U.S. Treasuries are still positive, though short-term yields aren’t far off after hitting record lows Friday.
Central banks are pumping in record amounts of money into the bond market to help ease the economic damage caused by the coronavirus. The European Central Bank’s pandemic program totals 1.35 trillion euros ($1.58 trillion), while the Federal Reserve is buying about $80 billion a month.
And the move to lower rates may not have finished. Traders in money markets are pricing the Bank of England will cut interest rates from 0.1% to 0% by March next year. Fed officials are meeting this week, though probably won’t adopt a shift in strategy after Chair Jerome Powell said rates will stay near zero for a long while.
German 10-year yields are currently hovering around minus 0.48%, while U.K. and Japanese bonds out to seven years have yields below 0%. Japan’s 10-year is just two basis points above the threshold. Those on Treasuries are at 0.57%, having touched a record low of 0.31% in March.
Corporate Debt
The trend has also been mirrored in the corporate bond world. Negative-yielding euro corporate bonds now amount to 267 billion euros, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. It would take a 25-basis-point drop in average yields to boost this number by another half a trillion euros.
It was a different story back in March, when investors were dumping corporate bonds, fearing that the effective shutdown of large parts of advanced economies would impact companies’ ability to pay back their debt. That led the amount of corporate bonds quoted at a negative yield to fall to zero.
With yields evaporating in the government bond market, more investors are expected to jump to credit, pushing more corporate bonds into negative yields. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). analysts expect the stock of sub-zero euro corporate bonds to jump to 500 billion euros.
“With central bank accommodation likely to continue even as peak pandemic fears fade, it means that this negative-yielding environment is one that investors will have to get used to and adapt for,” said Mohammed Kazmi, a portfolio manager at Union Bancaire Privee. He favors U.S. dollar corporate bonds, which remain far away from the 0% threshold.

1623,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 06:37AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday, July 27th","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Gold prices hit an all-time high as market participants bet on more stimulus from the Fed against an uncertain U.S. economic backdrop. The Republicans' stimulus plans should be published today but are expected to be far away from the Democrat-led House of Representatives' ideas. Durable goods orders are expected to continue recovering, but the U.K. casts doubt on Europe's recovery from the pandemic with a quarantine on travelers from Spain. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, July 27th.
1 Gold hits record high; silver surges
The price of gold hit a new all-time high, as concern over the health of the U.S. recovery and increasing signs of second waves of coronavirus around the world strengthened demand for the asset that is no-one’s liability.
Gold futures rose as high as $1,939.35 a troy ounce before retracing to trade at $1.938.35 an ounce by 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT).
Silver futures also surged again in sympathy, rising 6.1% to $24.24 an ounce, the highest since 2013. The Dollar Index, meanwhile, hit its lowest since September 2018.
The prospect of negative real interest rates for the foreseeable future has bolstered the case for non-interest-bearing haven assets, with both gold and silver ETFs registering heavy inflows in recent weeks.
2. U.K. quarantines visitors from Spain
One of the factors underpinning demand for havens is the increasing suspicion that the world isn’t bringing the coronavirus pandemic under control.
China has registered its highest number of new infections since March owing to outbreaks from Xinjian in its far west to Liaoning in the north-east. It’s also tightened lockdowns in Hong Kong, restricting public gatherings to no more than two people (an action that will raise eyebrows in Washington, given the political backdrop).
Of most concern to developed markets, however, is arguably the U.K. decision to impose a two-week quarantine on travelers returning from Spain, a focal point for European summer vacations. Spanish regions including Catalonia have been forced to tighten restrictions on the hospitality sector against a backdrop of evidence showing the impossibility of enforcing social distancing rules.
3. Stocks set to open higher; NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI)'s earnings eyed
However, the idea that ‘bad news is good news’ is again in the ascendant as risk assets get support from speculation that the Federal Reserve will resort to more stimulus at its policy meeting this week.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 125 points, or 0.5%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was up 0.6% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 1.2%.
Earnings season is taking a bit of a breather, with the only updates of note coming from NXP, Oaktree Capital, Albertsons and Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS). In Europe. Software giant SAP beat expectations and Ryanair warned of a tough nine months ahead. Luxury giant LVMH reports after the close.
4. Mnuchin promises stimulus proposals
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said he expects the Republican Party to present its new stimulus proposals in the Senate later today, according to various reports, after losing last week to internal arguments. The Wall Street Journal reported that the GOP-led Senate is likely to propose a bill that extends the $600 weekly unemployment benefit checks to households, but which contains no funds expressly for city and state administrations.
There’s a big gap between that position and the much more expensive proposals drafted by the Democrat majority in the House of Representatives.
Alongside doubts over the stimulus package, sentiment in the U.S. is also at risk from the spread of violent unrest in major cities as the wave of protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd by police morphs into a broader expression of the cultural divide across the country.
5. Durable Goods numbers due; German business confidence rises
Did Americans carry on spending their ‘enforced savings’ in June as they emerged from lockdown? Durable goods data, due at 8:30 AM ET, will give at least a partial answer. Consensus forecasts are for a 7.2% increase, following on from May’s 15.7% rise.
Data from elsewhere in the world continued to point to a moderate recovery. The German Ifo business confidence index increased by slightly more than expected, buttressing the impression made by IHSMarkit’s European PMIs on Friday.
Chinese industrial profits also rose 11.5% on the year in June, although they were still down by more than 12% over the first half as a whole.

1624,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>","Trump team, Senate Republicans agree on coronavirus aid offer to Democrats","By David Lawder and Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top aides to U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday they agreed in principle with Senate Republicans on a $1 trillion coronavirus relief package -- the party's opening offer in negotiations with Democrats less than a week before enhanced unemployment benefits expire.
White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters in the Capitol that he expects the package to be unveiled on Monday afternoon after some final details are clarified.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the package will contain extended unemployment benefits that aim to replace 70% of a laid-off worker's previous wages.
""We're done,"" Mnuchin told reporters as he left the Capitol on Sunday. He said some language was being checked, but there were ""no outstanding issues.""
Mnuchin and Meadows would not discuss details, but the $1 trillion Republican offer was expected to include another round of direct payments to individuals, a reduced federal supplement to unemployment benefits and liability protections against coronavirus-related lawsuits.
An extra $600 per week in federal unemployment benefits, which economists say has propped up consumer spending and has allowed laid off workers to pay rent and mortgages, is due to expire on Friday.
The benefits were part of $3.7 trillion in coronavirus aid approved in March as the U.S. economy shut down. But widespread business reopenings have been thwarted as the virus surges in states such as California and Florida, which overtook New York, an early hotspot, in total cases on Sunday.
More than 146,000 Americans have died of COVID-19 - nearly a quarter of the global total -- and there are nearly 4.2 million confirmed cases in the country, a rate of 1 infection in 79 people
Before going to Capitol Hill on Sunday, Mnuchin and Meadows floated the idea of a piecemeal approach to the next round of coronavirus relief, addressing expiring items while leaving other issues to be tackled later. Mnuchin told Fox News Sunday that the two most pressing issues were the expiring unemployment benefits and shielding businesses, schools and universities from lawsuits.
House Democrats passed their own $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill in May, which would keep the $600-a-week supplement in place through the end of 2020. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, criticized Republicans for not being able to agree on a plan when Americans are ""on the brink"" and going hungry.
""They're in disarray and that delay is causing suffering for America's families,"" Pelosi told CBS's ""Face the Nation.""
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Americans will receive a $1,200 check as part of the new package, along with tax credits for small businesses and restaurants. Kudlow told CNN's ""State of the Union"" the package would also extend a federal moratorium of evictions contained in previous relief legislation.
Democrats prefer a flat amount of enhanced benefits rather than having to figure out 70% of a worker's wages, a problem for some antiquated state computer systems. 
""The reason we had $600 was its simplicity,"" Pelosi said.
On liability protections, Pelosi said Democrats will not support a scenario in which workers can be told they are essential but the employer has no responsibility to make the workplace safe for them.
Mnuchin told Fox News Sunday that he was optimistic about a deal with Democrats. 

""We can move very quickly with the Democrats on these issues. We've moved quickly before, and I see no reason why we can't move quickly again,"" Mnuchin said.

1625,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>","Tokyo, Sydney aim to lure edgy HK financial firms, but Singapore a top draw","By Alun John, Scott Murdoch and Anshuman Daga
HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Japan, Australia and some other nations are readying incentives to attract banks and asset managers in Hong Kong that are worried about the new security law imposed by China, but finance sector experts said even if they move, it will be to Singapore.
High taxes and costs, bloated bureaucracies and cultural differences in some of these Asia-Pacific nations present formidable challenges for the Hong Kong financial institutions to relocate even partially, while Singapore's similarities to Hong Kong give it an advantage, they said, though the Southeast Asian city-state has not actively been seeking such business.
Beijing imposed a tough national security law from July 1 on Hong Kong, regional home to many global financial groups, prompting companies to reassess their operations there. 
Hong Kong's financial regulators said last week they had been approached by institutions concerned about the law, but they said it would not affect operations. 
Nonetheless, rivals hope to benefit from the concerns. 
""The political upheaval in Hong Kong has created an opportunity for Australia and Sydney to become a stronger regional financial centre,"" Senator Andrew Bragg wrote to Australia's Treasurer this month, proposing policy changes. 
Japan included attracting “excellent human resources” to form a global financial centre in an economic policy roadmap earlier this month, following official remarks they could win business from Hong Kong. 
Ruling party draft proposals include visa support and streamlining approvals for investment management licences. 
Smaller financial centres are also trying their luck.
Busan in South Korea is offering tax breaks and rent free offices to financial firms, while Taiwan's top regulator told Reuters he hoped the island's rule of law and democratic values would attract business. 
UPHILL STRUGGLE
However, the mooted reforms do not move the dial enough, say some sector professionals. 
""Tokyo will, frankly, struggle to steal significant market share from, let alone replace, Hong Kong,"" said Steven Tran, a partner at law firm Mayer Brown in Hong Kong, who was previously based in Tokyo for four years. 
Tran said Japanese taxes, together with a perceived greater level of bureaucracy, higher labour costs and less English language fluency, would make it harder for financial institutions to operate regional hubs from Tokyo.
Hong Kong’s corporate tax rate of 16.5% is a little over half that of Japan's and Australia's, and among the lowest in the region. 
Convincing senior staff to give up an international lifestyle in Hong Kong is another challenge.
""Typically, when expatriates move to Japan they need much more hand-holding than when moving to Hong Kong,"" said Jeremy Laughlin, a Tokyo-based business development manager at Santa Fe Relocation.
Language and cultural difficulties as well as the absence of adequate financial infrastructure could scupper South Korea and Taiwan's efforts too. 
Cultural issues are less difficult for Australia, but Financial Services Council CEO Sally Loane said Australia needed to implement greater tax reform and make regulatory changes to align its fund management industry with other Asian jurisdictions to attract Hong Kong business. 
SINGAPORE, OR STAY?
Institutions have not made any major moves from Hong Kong as yet, but they are being circumspect even about discussing contingency plans as the topic is sensitive and many hope to expand in mainland China.
Lawyers and advisers say Singapore is the most likely beneficiary of any relocation, thanks to its corporate tax rate of 17%, a business friendly environment, and its standing as a financial centre.
""Everyone is competing for talent but in terms of population, economic profile, and ease of doing business, Singapore is the most similar to Hong Kong,"" said Jason Salim, a Singapore-based analyst at risk consultancy Control Risks.

""In the second half of the year, the economic recovery could continue,"" the German central bank said in its monthly report. ""The recent stimulus package will also contribute to that.""
The German central bank also said it expected the pandemic-related global slowdown in trade to bring down the country's oversized current account surplus.
This has been the target of criticism both within the European Union and by Donald Trump's U.S. administration for causing macro-economic imbalances.

The Bundesbank now sees Germany's current account surplus at less than 5% of the country's gross domestic product each year until 2022, down from more than 7% last year.

The European Union let its member countries suspend import duties on medical equipment needed to fight the coronavirus for three more months.
The European Commission allowed EU governments to waive the bloc’s tariffs on goods such as masks, testing kits and ventilators until Oct. 31 amid a resurgence in Covid-19 cases worldwide. The move also maintains a suspension of value-added tax on the products.
“Since the number of Covid-19 infections in member states still poses public health risks and as shortages for goods needed to combat the Covid-19 pandemic are still reported in the member states, it is necessary to extend the period,” the commission, the 27-nation EU’s executive arm in Brussels, said on Monday in the Official Journal.
The EU import-duty and VAT relief was introduced in early April when Europe had become the epicenter of the pandemic and was struggling to contain it. The suspension of levies has applied retroactively from Jan. 30 and was due to lapse on July 31.

1629,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 03:50AM ET</span>",Economic pitfalls risk cooling Egypt's hot money inflows,"By Ulf Laessing, Tom Arnold and Davide Barbuscia
CAIRO/LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - The threat of conflict in Libya, water security worries and a flatlining tourist sector risk upending a nascent rally in Egyptian bonds, bankers and economists say.
The North African country has attracted a wave of foreign investor interest in the past three months, emboldened by fresh financing from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and short-term local debt offering yields of around 13%, among the highest in emerging markets.
Bankers and economists warn, however, that the yield bonanza masks an economy with weak prospects and heightened political risk, with the Cairo bourse <.EGX.30> falling on several days this month on fears of a Libya intervention. Parliament gave President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi last week the green light for possible military intervention in Libya.
A deployment of armed forces into Libya could lead to higher military spending at a time when COVID-19 is already hitting the budget deficit.
""Obviously the IMF support package has reassured foreign investors and that is why there has been an improvement in flows, but the fundamentals are still weak,"" said Zeina Rizk, executive fixed income director at Arqaam Capital.
""The virus is raging, tourism is down, and government spending – needed to boost the economy – will add further leverage,"" she added.
Adding further uncertainty, Egypt has failed so far to reach a deal with Ethiopia to regulate flows from its Grand Renaissance Dam (GERD) which threatens its main water source.
""The political risk has deteriorated,"" said Hasnain Malik, head of equity research at Tellimer Research. 
The tourism industry, meanwhile, which makes up as much as 15% of GDP, is unlikely to recover soon, analysts said. Egypt, unlike Tunisia and Morocco, has not been added to the European Union's list of safe COVID-19 countries.
Egypt's reported COVID-19 cases have been falling in the past weeks but the number of new infections remains too high for now to lift the travel warning, diplomats said.
Tourist flights to Red Sea resorts have been rising since airports reopened on July 1, but normal occupancy rates would be only back by March or April next year, said Alaa Akel, head of the Egyptian Hotels Association Red Sea.
More than half of the hotels are back in business after two months of lockdown and those still closed will probably re-open by November, he added. 
The central bank and state press centre did not respond to questions sent by Reuters.
The government expected growth of 3.5% in the fiscal year 2020/21, which began in July, but growth could slow to 2% if the coronavirus crisis continues until year-end, Planning Minister Hala al-Saeed said in May.
ECONOMIC FALLOUT 
Sisi in March approved a 100 billion pound ($6 billion) plan to stem the economic fallout, including support for the tourism sector, payments of salaries for staff sent home by their employers and cash for informal workers.
With foreign reserves standing at $38 billion, Egypt's finances are in much better shape than in 2011 after the toppling of Hosni Mubarak. 
This is down from $45 billion from before the pandemic, but the central bank has been able to support the currency, which strengthened in July after a dip the month before, a gain that helped buyers of short-term debt make a profit, bankers say.
""We have been seeing significant flows back into Egypt,"" said Farouk Soussa, senior Middle East and North Africa economist at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). ""The inflows have indeed been at the short end of the curve, reflecting higher short term yields and the potential for near-term strengthening in the pound, which make the carry trade the most lucrative in Egypt at the moment,"" said Soussa.
He was referring to a strategy which involves investors borrowing in currencies where interest rates are low to invest in countries where yields are high.
Egypt's international bonds have performed better than some other similarly rated emerging market sovereigns, such as El Salvador and Sri Lanka, since the March sell-off.
Egypt's 2025 , 2027  and 2040  issues are trading around 12% or less from pre-pandemic highs, Refinitiv data shows.
But analysts say the inflow of ""hot money"" -- or investments made for short periods -- does not translate into new jobs in the real economy and might disappear if the currency slips.
Barring its energy sector, Egypt had been struggling to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), a predicament blamed by analysts on bureaucracy and an expansion of army-owned firms in sectors from food production to cement.

""Increasing long term foreign direct investment further will require improvement in Doing Business indicators, maintaining a sound, predictable macroeconomic framework and political stability,"" Raza Agha, head of emerging markets credit strategy, Legal & General Investment Management.

Tackling the biggest economic collapse in living memory, the ECB is buying debt through a 1.35 trillion euro ($1.58 trillion) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) and paying banks to lend out its cash as it tries to protect the bloc's economy from the coronavirus fallout.
""It's too soon to declare victory,"" Panetta said in the interview circulated by the ECB on Monday, adding that the euro zone economy was likely to see a bigger contraction in the second quarter than in the first three months of the year.
While recent data has shown an improvement in industrial production, retail sales and the purchasing managers' index, he said this had been expected given the earlier catastrophic drop in economic activity and government measures to boost the economy.
""They don't give us sufficient grounds for satisfaction,"" Panetta said.
""The programme is working well, and I don't see any economic reasons to change our decisions or actions,"" he said referring to the PEPP.
Economic activity is lingering well below its pre-coronavirus levels and is unlikely to return to those levels before the end of 2022, he said.
""Until we're sure that the effects of the crisis have been reabsorbed we will need to go on providing a strong monetary stimulus to consolidate the recovery, thus bringing the inflation level back up,"" he said.

The purchase programmes and refinancing operations that the ECB has announced since March will likely cause a cumulative rise of 0.8 percentage points in inflation and 1.3 percentage points in gross domestic product, Panetta said.

Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said the programme is a follow-up to the 30 trillion rupiah allocated to state lenders which carries similar requirements and targets.
The funds will be placed with regional development banks in the capital Jakarta and the provinces of West Java, Central Java, East Java, and North Sulawesi. The government is also considering fund placements at regional development banks in Bali and Yogyakarta provinces.
Indrawati also announced during an online briefing a 15 trillion rupiah loan scheme for the provincial governments of Jakarta and West Java, the countries top economic and industrial hubs, to revive economic activity. 
The funds were raised by the central bank buying government bonds, which will allow for low interest costs for the provincial governments to build roads, markets and health infrastructure, Indrawati said. 
""The aim is to restart projects that were postponed due to (budget) refocusing efforts and support economic growth while upholding COVID-19 health protocols,"" Indrawati said.

Indonesia's economy is expected to contract or at best barely grow this year, according to the finance ministry, as the pandemic slashes economic activity.

1632,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2020 10:25PM ET</span>",Australian inflation likely fell by record in second-quarter amid virus fight,"By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian inflation likely took its largest decline on record in the second quarter as the government made child care free to help families through the COVD-19 lock down and petrol prices tumbled, though much of that will reverse this quarter.
Analysts polled by Reuters forecast the consumer price index (CPI) dived 2% in the June quarter, from the first, causing annual prices to drop 0.4% in the first negative reading since 1998. The data are due on Wednesday.
That would be a major setback for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which had spent years trying to get inflation back up into its 2-3% target band and had been making progress with a reading of 2.2% in the first quarter.
Neither is the outlook favourable given the economy is almost certainly in its first recession since the early 1990s.
""Inflation is likely to remain very subdued given elevated unemployment, weak housing rents and new dwellings costs which make up around 15% of the CPI basket, along with the disinflationary impetus from China's factories,"" said Tapas Strickland, at economist at NAB.
A negative reading will not, however, mean Australia is in deflation which is a general and sustained fall in the level of prices across the economy.
Rather this is a one-off caused in part by the government making child care free from early April to late June, which alone will take around 1.1 percentage points from CPI.
With that relief now ended, child care costs will rebound sharply this quarter. 
Likewise, petrol dived in line with a slide in oil to less than zero, though again that has since rebounded.
As a result core measures of inflation that strip out the largest price moves should stay positive, with analysts predicting the trimmed mean will rose 0.1% in the quarter and 1.4% for the year.
Still, the RBA is concerned that a low reading could become baked in to future inflation expectations, lowering wage growth and making it harder to get prices back up.

It has already cut rates to a record low of 0.25% and took the exceptional step of pledging to keep rates down for years to come in the hope of avoiding a drift toward damaging deflation.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Bank of Japan policymakers debated how the COVID-19 pandemic could reshape monetary policy and its impact on the economy, a summary of their opinions at a July rate review showed, a sign they were bracing for a prolonged battle against the health crisis.
Many in the nine-member board warned any domestic recovery from the devastating economic impact of the pandemic would be modest and could be delayed depending on how long it takes to contain the outbreak, according to the summary released on Monday.
""The BOJ must deepen its understanding on how COVID-19 could reshape monetary policy. It must scrutinise the transmission channel and effect of its policies, given the risk of further declines in prices and growth expectations,"" one member was quoted as saying.
""We must take further action promptly as needed, with an eye on whether the existing policy framework is sufficient,"" according to another opinion shown in the summary.
Several board members cautioned that any further economic stress would require policymakers to pay close attention on Japan's banking system and long-term inflation expectations, the summary showed.
The remarks highlight the dilemma the BOJ faces as it struggles to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic with a dwindling policy tool-kit. Years of ultra-low interest rates have also strained commercial banks, stoking fears that further rate cuts could backfire by eroding their ability to lend.
At the July rate review, the BOJ kept monetary policy steady and maintained its view that the economy would gradually recover from the crisis.
The global spread of the coronavirus has forced the BOJ to put off efforts to achieve its elusive 2% inflation target for the time being, and focus on pumping money to cash-strapped firms hit by the outbreak.

The BOJ releases a summary of opinions voiced by its board members about 10 market days after each rate review. It does not disclose the identity of the member who made the comments.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's thousands of state-owned enterprises, local governments, and public institutions are expanding hiring as a record number of students graduate into a job market left reeling by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Around 8.7 million Chinese students are graduating this year, almost half a million more than last year, heading into an uncertain future as private firms rein in recruitment.
Job stability for the young is a longstanding political concern in China. President Xi Jinping, who has previously warned that struggling graduates could ""turn into negative energy,"" is urging more hiring.
Graduates, who generally enter the workforce in June or July, face a ""severe"" situation, officials have said. Available positions for them in the recent pre-graduation spring recruiting season fell by 22% on year, according to BOSS Zhipin Research.
While China's GDP bounced back into growth in the second quarter, surveyed unemployment of graduates aged 20-24 was more than three times the rate for the broader population, rising to 19.3% in June, 2.1 percentage points higher than May.
State-owned enterprises, local governments, and public institutions, known collectively as ""the system"", are responding to Xi's call.
Oil giant Sinopec (NYSE:SHI) Corp is more than doubling its 2020 recruitment numbers, with an additional 3,500 positions for new graduates.
In Henan province, provincial SOEs have been told to expand hiring and reserve at least half the new positions for graduates.
""Clearly, initiatives such as this run counter to the idea that China's SOEs are run on a purely commercial basis,"" said Louis Kuijs, of Oxford Economics. SOEs, which enjoy privileged access to certain sectors, have a ""special responsibility"" at times, he said.
Government schemes sending young people to work in less developed areas of China have also been bulked up: one, where graduates help with poverty alleviation and other community support, has 5,000 more places than last year.
Thousands more graduates than in 2019 will be granted passing grades in the highly competitive civil service exams, mainly held in the summer. Central Hubei province has increased its quota by more than 40%, while the northern region of Inner Mongolia has more than quadrupled its quota.
Efforts to directly soak up labour are limited as China's private sector accounts for 80% of urban jobs. But SOEs have also been told to help employment indirectly by promptly paying and reducing costs for smaller companies, said Andrew Polk, a partner at Trivium China, a research advisory.
SOEs have been pivotal in driving China's supply-led economic recovery amid the pandemic, although demand has not kept up, Polk said.
PROS AND CONS
In a letter dated July 7 to graduates embarking on grassroots work in the far western region of Xinjiang, Xi said he wanted degree holders to ""contribute more to the (Chinese Communist) Party, the motherland and the people.""
Coveted jobs in ""the system"" can provide security, status and help getting a more desirable ""hukou,"" a residential permit linked to access to local public services.
""Nothing is more important than stability,"" said Joanna Yu, an applicant for the civil service examination in Shandong province.
Jiang Zhenxin, who graduated this year, will spend two years working in county-level government in southern Guangdong province.
""As a Party member, working in the municipal committee is a way to serve the people,"" said Jiang.
But the bureaucratic life is not as comfortable as it used to be. Previous perks like gifts from local businesses have been cracked down on amid a years-long anti-corruption campaign.
And advancement for ambitious cadres has also slowed, likely to better protect the middle-aged officials who are key supporters of Xi, said Jerome Doyon, a lecturer at Oxford University.

""Now is not an ideal time to be a young official in China,"" he said.

1639,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 26, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>",Economic Calendar - Top 5 Things to Watch This Week,"By Noreen Burke
Investing.com -- As Congress continues to debate more fiscal aid the Federal Reserve will likely hold fire at the conclusion of its policy meeting Wednesday but stick to a cautious tone on the economic outlook. With market participants weighing escalating coronavirus cases in southern and western U.S. states and rising tensions between the U.S. and China some of the biggest names in big tech will report earnings. The highlight on the data calendar will be Thursday’s first estimate of U.S. second quarter GDP which will show the full scale of what is expected to have been the largest quarterly contraction ever. Meanwhile, German and euro zone second-quarter GDP figures are also expected to show steep contractions. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.
Approximately 32 million Americans on unemployment benefits are currently receiving $600 per week in expanded jobless benefits, but this is due to expire on July 31st.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Saturday said that the Trump administration supports extending enhanced unemployment benefits until the end of the year in the next round of coronavirus aid, albeit at a reduced level.
The administration and the U.S. Congress have been trying to hammer out a deal on the next round of pandemic relief and Republicans are expected to unveil their proposed measures early in the week which will then be debated. However, it is unclear whether an agreement can be reached before the current package of expanded jobless benefits expires, which means there could be harder times ahead.
The Fed will probably sit on its hands at its July 28-29 meeting after already slashing interest rates to near zero and pledging unlimited financial asset purchases. Officials are likely to reiterate guidance that rates will remain near zero until the economy gets back to normal.
Fed policymakers have become more downbeat on the economic outlook in recent weeks, with some cautioning that recent improvements in economic data such as job gains may be fleeting amid a resurgence in the coronavirus pandemic.
“The pandemic remains the key driver of the economy’s course. A thick fog of uncertainty still surrounds us, and downside risks predominate,” Fed governor Lael Brainard said earlier this month.
The rally on Wall Street that has brought the S&P 500 to nearly 5% below its record high reached in February and seen the Nasdaq gain more than 15% year-to-date will be tested this week, with dozens of major companies reporting earnings.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is due to report on Wednesday, while tech bellwether Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), along with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are due on Thursday. Other companies scheduled to report include pharmaceuticals Merck (NYSE:MRK),  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), as well as McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Results from energy giants  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) are due out Friday.
Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google, the five largest U.S. stocks, now account for 22% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Goldman Sach said in a recent report.
The U.S. Commerce Department is due to give its first take on second-quarter GDP on Thursday, with analysts forecasting a bruising 34% annualized decline during the three-month period.
The recovery now looks at risk as cases of the virus have exploded across the country, prompting some authorities in the hard-hit South and West regions to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings.
“Even as the Fed maintains its ultra-loose policy stance and Congress provides further fiscal support, ongoing social distancing requirements are likely to keep GDP well below its pre-virus trend and the unemployment rate elevated over the coming years,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
While data on Monday is expected to show another increase in durable goods orders, Thursday’s figures on initial jobless claims are expected to remain elevated.
Figures from Germany on Thursday and the wider euro zone on Friday will show the extent of the economic contraction caused by lockdowns during the second quarter. Germany’s economy, the euro area’s largest is expected to contract by 9% while the euro zone is set to slump 11.2%.
The euro hit 21-month highs above $1.16 on Friday after the European Union set aside differences and agreed a COVID-19 recovery fund. This signal of solidarity, combined with monetary and budget stimulus, could propel the currency to $1.20, some predict.
The optimism could take the sting out of the dismal GDP data.

European Union leaders on Tuesday clinched an historic deal on a massive stimulus plan for their coronavirus-throttled economies following a fractious summit lasting almost five days.
The agreement paves the way for the European Commission, the EU's executive, to raise up to 750 billions euros on capital markets on behalf of all 27 states, an unprecedented act of solidarity in almost seven decades of integration.
""It's important that the EU has proven its capability to act in the crisis,"" Weidmann told Funke media group in an interview, adding that showing solidarity also in financial terms was the right thing to do in the current crisis.
But Weidmann added the agreed debt mechanism should remain an exemption and that strict conditions had to be attached to the financial aid.
""Control mechanisms are needed to ensure that funds are used sensibly and efficiently,"" Weidmann said.
""Generally, I think joint debt for extensive transfers is questionable. At the very least, the package should not serve as a springboard for large-scale EU debt for regular household financing,"" he said.
The central bank chief also pointed to the current developments in the United States, an important trading partner for Germany.
""The U.S. loosened some of its measures early on and is now tightening them up again in some places. This stop-and-go is certainly difficult for the economy,"" Weidmann said.
""In any case, this shows how important it is to stay vigilant, to closely monitor the infection process and to prevent a flare-up.""
Turning to Germany, Weidmann said Europe's largest economy had passed the peak of the pandemic as well as the low point of the economic crisis. Retail sales were picking up again and production was also increasing.

""Overall, the data shows that the economy bottomed out in spring and is now gradually recovering,"" Weidman said.

The administration and the U.S. Congress have been trying to strike a deal on the next aid package as enhanced unemployment benefits of $600 a week that Congress approved earlier in the pandemic expire on July 31. 
Mnuchin said he had spoken on Friday with top Democrat in Congress, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has said she does not want a short-term extension of unemployment insurance. 
""We don't want a short-term extension either, we want something till the end of the year,"" said Mnuchin, who was in the Capitol on Saturday with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to meet with staff of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on finishing up details of the package. 
Mnuchin said last week Republicans were looking at an extension of unemployment benefits that replace 70% of wages, an idea he repeated on Saturday. ""We want to make sure that there's a technical correction, so that people don't get paid more money to stay home than to work,"" he said. 
Mnuchin said he expected initial language of the legislation to emerge on Monday. 

Meadows suggested that a deal on a standalone bill on unemployment benefits could be reached before the July 31 deadline, leaving time on other issues to help Americans deal with the economic slowdown from the pandemic.

1643,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2020 03:55PM ET</span>","Argentina says it will not raise 'last' debt offer, willing to tweak legal terms","BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's government reaffirmed on Saturday that it would not budge from its latest proposal to restructure around the $65 billion in debt, but signaled it would be willing to negotiate on the fine print around the deal. 
The South American country is facing a standoff with bondholders after creditor groups joined forces to reject the government's proposal earlier in July and put forward one of their own. 
The government has repeatedly said it cannot offer more, though sources told Reuters this week it would be willing to negotiate key contractual terms.
""Argentina wishes to and will contribute to the development of contractual instruments that enhance the success of sovereign restructuring initiatives when they enjoy meaningful creditor support,"" the Economy Ministry said in a statement.  
The ministry said the bondholder group's counterproposal called for ""yet more generous financial terms for the creditors compared to Argentina's current offer,"" while requesting that Argentina cover fees and expenses of the creditors' advisors.
""Those aspects of the counterproposal that seek to impose additional burdens on an economy that is choking in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis ... cannot be accommodated,"" the ministry said in the statement. 
Analysts say a gap of about 3 cents on the dollar between the sides at the negotiating table should be bridged in last-ditch talks ahead of a current Aug. 4 deadline for a deal to avoid a messy legal standoff.
Creditors' legal demands include that amendments be made to the 2016 indenture for new debt issued in exchange for 'Macri' bonds, to prevent the government from using 'Pac-Man' style measures to make future changes to any agreement.

Argentina has been in default since May, the country's ninth, and is headed for 10-12% economic contraction this year due to the impact of COVID-19, deepening a recession that began in 2018.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Members of Singapore's Lim family have asked a court to stop law firm Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP (R&T) from working for court-appointed supervisors to two companies in the Lim's embattled oil trading empire, Evan Lim Chee Meng told Reuters.
Lim and his sister, Lim Huey Ching, filed an application to restrain R&T from acting for the judicial managers of fleet manager Ocean Tankers Pte Ltd, Lim said in an email on Friday. A similar application had been made in regard to oil trader Hin Leong Trading Pte Ltd, he said.
They filed application on behalf of Ocean Tankers and Hin Leong Trading. Lim and his sister are directors of both companies.
The actions are the latest in a series stemming from the collapse earlier this year of Hin Leong and Ocean Tankers, both of which were placed under court-appointed supervisors.
Hin Leong is seeking to restructure billions of dollars of debt after a crash in oil prices revealed a massive, years long fraud at the once fabled trading house.
""R&T sees no legal or factual basis for the position now taken by the members of the Lim family purportedly acting as directors of the two companies,"" the law firm said in a statement to Reuters.
EY, the court-appointed interim judicial manager (IJM) for Ocean Tankers, and PwC, the IJM for Hin Leong, did not respond to requests for comment.
The Lims said in a court affidavit reviewed by Reuters that they were told by R&T on May 12 that the law firm would act for Ocean Tankers' IJM, EY. They said from the early 1990s, R&T had advised and acted for their family and their group of companies.
R&T possessed confidential information and documents that were at risk of being misused by the firm in its new role to benefit the supervisors, against the family's interests, they said in the affidavit.
These included financial statements and management accounts, shareholders' agreements, loan agreements and charter agreements related to vessels owned by companies owned by the Lims, they said.
In the affidavit, the Lims said R&T had ""to date refused to step down despite repeated requests to do so, which has necessitated this application.""
The case will be heard on Aug. 11, Lim said.
R&T told Reuters by email it had never advised or acted for the Lim family in connection with the financial distress of their companies. It said it acted for Ocean Tankers and Hin Leong to file for judicial management and the appointment of IJMs.
After the IJMs were appointed, R&T said, it agreed to continue acting for the two companies and for the IJMs of both firms, ""subject to certain conditions which ensured that there would not be a conflict of interest or abuse of confidential information.""

Expressing ""grave concern"" for a sweeping national security law imposed by China on the former British colony, the 27 EU states agreed on Friday to a series of sanctions, including trade curbs and a review of visa agreements with the territory.
The document, backed by EU ambassadors, says the bloc will be ""further scrutinising and limiting exports of specific sensitive equipment and technologies for end-use in Hong Kong, in particular where there are grounds to suspect undesirable use relating to internal repression, the interception of internal communications or cybersurveillance"".
The document is expected to enter into force on Tuesday.
The Beijing-drafted national security law punishes what China broadly defines as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
Critics of the law fear it will crush the wide-ranging freedoms promised to the territory when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, including the right to protest and an independent legal system.
Supporters of the law say it will bring stability after last year's often-violent anti-government and anti-China unrest.
The European Union also committed to ""considering the implications of the national security legislation for asylum, migration, visa and residence policy"", the document said.
The bloc will not launch any new negotiation with Hong Kong for the time being and will review the implications of the security law on existing agreements it has with Hong Kong.
The agreed measures could be applied by the European Union or its member states ""as deemed appropriate"", the document says.
The European Union reiterated its support for Hong Kong's autonomy and its citizens, pledging to further engaging with the civil society there.
The impact of the adopted measures will be reviewed before the end of the year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. bank regulator approved a new rule on Friday that will make it easier for banks to hire individuals with minor criminal records, expanding the pool of potential candidates and leveling the playing field for aspiring bank workers.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's new rule aims to reduce the hurdles for candidates with records of minor criminal offenses, typically those that carry a sentence of less than one year, agency officials told Reuters.
Some banks have lobbied to reduce hiring restrictions with respect to minor criminal records to allow them to tap a more diverse pool of candidates.
Federal law prohibits banks from hiring a person found guilty of certain crimes unless they secure a written waiver from the regulator. Friday's rule expands the crimes for which banks do not need to seek that waiver, such as small dollar theft of under $1000 and possession of fake identification.
The rule, approved unanimously, cements an informal internal policy under which the FDIC had already been issuing waivers for such minor crimes, the officials said. But they hope that formalizing the rule could clear the way for more potential candidates who were either scared off by the requirement or lost out to similar candidates who did not face the same hurdle.
The FDIC receives roughly 100 waiver applications annually, but the rule change could cut that number by around 30%, according to officials.
The FDIC also on Friday scrapped a five-year waiting period between a conviction and working at a bank for minor crimes, and will allow hires with a second minor offense subject to a three-year waiting period.

The IHS Markit preliminary composite index of purchasing managers at manufacturers and service providers improved 2.1 points to a six-month high of 50, the dividing line between expansion and contraction, the group reported Friday.
The data show the world’s largest economy is a step behind Europe, where PMIs improved markedly and showed expansion during the month. The composite index for the euro area climbed to the highest level since June 2018.
The U.S. composite index reflected ongoing contraction in service industries, albeit at a slower pace, as a resurgence in the virus outbreak prompted several states to restrict some activities such as dining out. At the same time, manufacturing expanded in July at the fastest pace since January, according to IHS Markit.
“While the stabilization of business activity in July is welcome news, the lack of growth is a disappointment,’’ Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement. “Moreover, a renewed acceleration in the rate of loss of new business raises concerns that demand is faltering. Many companies, notably in consumer-facing areas of the service sector, linked falling sales to re-imposed lockdowns.’’
At the same time, the group’s composite measure of future activity advanced to the highest level since April 2019, indicating service providers and manufacturers were more upbeat about activity in the coming year.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Sub-Saharan Africa's economy will contract this year after shutdowns disrupted activity and as daily cases of coronavirus are still rising in the region but a recovery is expected next year, a Reuters poll found on Friday.
Following months of lockdowns which have muted economic activity a Reuters poll taken in the past week suggested the region will contract 3.1% this year but bounce back to around 3.5% growth in 2021.
Some countries have begun relaxing restrictions but virus cases are still increasing, unlike in many developed countries that have started to show signs of recovery, so the uncertainty meant the range of forecasts for next year was wide - between flatlining and 4.8% growth.
South Africa has reported the most cases in Africa, partly reflecting more widespread testing, and it is harder to gauge the full extent of outbreaks elsewhere although there are no signs numbers are falling.
""Growth downgrades dominate in a region where external and fiscal buffers were already substantially eroded. The impact of COVID-19 will reduce growth even further,"" Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) wrote in a note.
Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy, was expected to contract 3.7% this year but bounce back to 2.0% growth next year.
Continental peer South Africa was expected to grow 3.5% next year following an 8.0% contraction this year, a Reuters poll showed last week.
However, Ghana, one of the continents oil exporters, was still expected to grow, expanding 1.9% this year and 4.2% in 2021.
""Despite the obvious downside risks from lower oil prices and headwinds from COVID-19, we believe Ghana has a decent growth outlook and reasonably comfortable external sector metrics relative to other African oil exporters,"" said Michael Kafe, economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""The fallout from COVID-19 and associated lockdown means GDP growth is likely to be weak this year. However, unlike other African oil exporters such as Angola, Gabon and Nigeria, where GDP growth is likely to contract this year, we expect Ghana to post positive GDP growth.""
Kenya - east Africa's biggest economy - was expected to have a lacklustre performance this year with no growth, a poor outcome having averaged around 6% annual growth in the past decade.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia is considering returning tax paid by companies to support them during the coronavirus pandemic, the country's deputy finance minister said on Friday, as the government seeks to retune parts of its economic stimulus.
Southeast Asia's largest economy has budgeted 695.2 trillion rupiah ($47.81 billion) for its pandemic response, but some existing tax incentives had not been widely taken up, Suahasil Nazara said in an online interview.
""We're thinking of giving a tax cashback. So if a business player has been compliant with its taxes all this time, we will return their 2019 taxes,"" Nazara said, declining to comment on whether this could be all or part of a company's tax payments.
The government may also scrap a minimum electricity payment for businesses in the pandemic, allowing firms to pay only for power consumed, he said, adding that power company Perusahaan Listrik Negara would get state compensation.
Government spending and a projected fall in revenue is pressuring Indonesia's budget, with the 2020 deficit set to be the widest in more than a decade at 6.34% of gross domestic product.
The government has faced criticism for being slow to spend after only using 39% of the 2020 budget in the first semester.
Nazara said the finance ministry had been meeting other government agencies to accelerate the execution of programmes to try to prevent GDP from contracting this year after growing 5% in 2019.
DEBT MONETISATION
Indonesia has issued an emergency decree to waive a fiscal deficit ceiling of 3% for three years, while Bank Indonesia (BI) has agreed to buy 397.6 trillion rupiah of bonds this year and relinquish interest payments.
Nazara said this would help manage the proportion of interest expenses in the budget at 14%-15% annually, up from 12% pre-pandemic. Without the BI arrangement, the proportion would hit 17% in coming years, he said.
The question of whether to continue BI's debt monetisation next year ""is on the table right now, the answer of which we are formulating by moving forward little by little"", he said.
Fiscal policy would remain expansive for as long as needed, Nazara said, noting that a target to return the budget deficit to below 3% in 2023 could still be relaxed if there was political agreement.
For next year, government officials and lawmakers have been discussing a 4.7% deficit.

The euro suddenly looks unstoppable, hitting 21-month highs above $1.16 after the European Union set aside differences and agreed a COVID-19 recovery fund. This signal of solidarity, combined with monetary and budget stimulus, could propel the currency to $1.20, some predict. 
The optimism should take the sting out of upcoming German and euro zone second-quarter gross domestic product data, expected to show steep contractions amid the coronavirus hit.
Euro gains stem partly from dollar woes; coronavirus outbreaks across the United States and tensions with China have set the greenback on track for its worst month since Jan. 2018.
One hitch: In nominal trade-weighted terms, the euro is now above 2018 peaks. If exports take a hit, euro strength won't sit well with policymakers.

Microsoft's disappointing second-quarter earnings shifted the focus to Amazon and Apple, which both report on Thursday and have seen shares soar this year, thanks to strong demand for products and services from people staying at home during the pandemic.
Apple's 32% surge in 2020 increased its market capitalization to $1.65 trillion, Microsoft is snapping at its heels at $1.56 trillion, while Amazon is at $1.51 trillion.
Two others in the FAANG quintet, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), also have results coming up. But they are out of the race: the latter just barely squeezes into the trillion-dollar club.

3/LONG GAME?
After slashing interest rates to near zero and engaging in huge asset buying, the U.S. Federal Reserve will probably sit on its hands at the July 28-29 meeting.
Markets are seeking clues on its next move. The Fed doesn't seem keen on yield curve control or negative interest rates. But if it wants to rely on asset purchases and forward guidance only, it might eventually need to expand QE, Fedwatchers reckon.
Also, this QE programme has spread purchases of Treasuries pretty evenly across the curve, while the last two rounds focused on the long end. Many predict the Fed will opt to up purchases in the 20- to 30-year bracket; that will keep in check the term premium - the extra return earned from holding long-term bonds.
Yet Fed Governor Lael Brainard recently mentioned the ""thick fog of uncertainty"" surrounding the U.S. economy. So for now, the Fed might just wait for that fog to dissipate.

5/BANKING ON PROVISIONS
In the first quarter, Europe's top 40 banks set aside 22 billion euros in provisions against loans going sour in the wake of COVID-19. As the second-quarter earnings season kicks off, focus is again on provisioning.
British banks set aside more in the first quarter than any other European country. Four of them --  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), Lloyds (LON:LLOY) and newly rebranded NatWest Group -- will disclose more in the coming days. 
Following the U.S. pattern, European investment banks should be cushioned by bumper earnings for their trading arms;  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) has already signalled better-than-expected profits. 
There are fewer bright spots for retail and corporate-focused names. Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) and BBVA (MC:BBVA), with large Latin American arms, also face the double whammy of loan loss provisions and exchange rate impact.

1654,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",Fed hoped to skirt a second virus wave. Small businesses may sink in it,"By Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - The number of outright failures of U.S. small businesses in the first months of the coronavirus pandemic was comparatively modest, but the months ahead look far grimmer as cash balances dwindle, federal help expires, and the disease surges back.
That outlook, taking shape from a range of research in recent weeks by business organizations and think tanks, suggests a reckoning awaits Federal Reserve officials and other policymakers who rolled out support quickly in March and April, and by June seemed hopeful an economic rebound was taking root.
After the Fed's June 10 meeting, Chair Jerome Powell said ""assuming that the disease remains or becomes pretty much under control, I think what you see is...an expansion that builds momentum over time."" The 7-day moving average of daily deaths that day was showing a steady decline and the number of new coronavirus cases was under 20,000.
Both have turned higher, with daily new cases nearing 70,000. When the central bank meets next week it will have to recalibrate its outlook around a new wave of infections policymakers had initially excluded from their baseline view of a steady rebound in the second half of the year. 
""The tone of next week's ... meeting is likely to be on the dour side,"" said Karim Basta, chief economist at III Capital Management.
Recent surveys indicate programs rolled out in March, including the Paycheck Protection Program's forgivable business loans, did prevent the worst in the pandemic's first phase. 
A recent survey covering more than 13,000 members of small business networking group Alignable found that among firms with at least one employee only an estimated 1.6% had closed permanently. That would translate nationally to about 96,000 of the roughly 6 million firms with between one and 500 workers.
The figure is consistent with estimates from Web site  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP) concluding around 77,000 firms listed on its review platform were shuttered for good. 
Both are below an earlier study coordinated by the Harvard Business School putting more than 100,000 small firms at risk of failure in the initial weeks of the pandemic.
A study by the JP Morgan Institute using data through May showed cash balances among many of the smallest businesses, notably restaurants and personal service firms, skyrocketed in May as federal relief funds bought them time. 
Sean Salas, chief executive of Camino Financial, an online lender focused on Latino-owned small businesses, said it was also borne out in a recent survey of loan recipients and applicants. Nearly 70% had reopened and almost all others were confident they would, as entrepreneurs pivoted to new business models, drew on family resources, or took other steps to stay afloat. So far. 
As government funds were deployed early on, ""I was very confident the failure rates would be low,"" Salas said. ""But as we think about the reemergence and the recovery, I do worry a bit more. The confidence level dipped at the end of June.""
ADJUST TO THE REALITY 
Some measures of recovery and reopening have indeed stalled.
Several states have placed fresh restrictions on commerce likely to hit small businesses disproportionately - this time without offers of loans or expanded unemployment benefits for workers and consumers unless Congress acts.
After a spate of optimism in June, a National Federation of Independent Business monthly survey found 23% of respondents in early July said they'd be out of business within six months ""under current economic conditions."" 
Other recent surveys have found increasing numbers of small entrepreneurs expect the recession to outlast their resources.
""The small business sector stalled in late June, and with public funding running dry the situation could deteriorate more in the coming weeks,"" said Oxford Economics analyst Gregory Daco. ""The Fed will have to adjust their discourse to the reality.""
While no updated economic projections are due at the Fed's July 28-29 meeting, its policy statement and Powell's press conference could describe the turn the economy seems to be approaching, with no clear sense that a robust reopening can proceed without risking faster coronavirus spread. 
(Graphic: A July jobs dip? link: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/SMALLBIZ/gjnpwxemkvw/chart.png)
May and June saw unexpected gains in employment as states lifted the virus-related restrictions that brought the economy to a halt in March and April.
Data released by Yelp this week showed the possible underside of that - a close correlation between user postings about bars and restaurants in May and the turn in infections that took root in June. 
(Graphic: Yelp ""interest"" surged; virus followed Yelp ""interest"" surged; virus followed link: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/YELP/rlgvdnwllvo/chart.png)
States that have been more successful in controlling the virus, like New York, also have higher percentages of businesses reporting as closed in surveys by groups like Alignable.
Bars are considered a particular hot spot for transmission, and states like Florida and Texas have reinstated restrictions on them. Overall, a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) ""lockdown index"" combining information on official restrictions and social distancing data, turned higher in early July after falling steadily from April's peak. 
(Graphic: The screws retighten? link: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/SMALLBIZ/xlbpgbnkevq/chart.png)

""We do expect closures to continue,"" said Yelp vice president for data science Justin Norman. ""We anticipate states will roll back or delay reopening plans ... possibly turning even more temporary closures into permanent ones.""

1655,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 24, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",The U.S.-China Trade Deal Risks Falling Victim to Spiraling Ties,"(Bloomberg) -- As U.S.-China ties have deteriorated since the Covid-19 pandemic devastated the globe, the trade deal they signed in January has served as sort of a linchpin in the relationship. Now that also could be coming undone.
President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly blamed China for the virus’s spread ahead of the U.S. election in November, said Thursday the phase-one trade deal “means less to me now than when I made it.” He spoke shortly after the U.S. shut down China’s consulate in Houston for spying and theft of intellectual property, which prompted Beijing to retaliate Friday by ordering American diplomats to abandon their Chengdu outpost.
“The phase-one trade deal between the U.S. and China hangs by a thread,” said Eswar Prasad, who once led the International Monetary Fund’s China team, and is now at Cornell University. “China has an incentive to keep the trade deal with the U.S. from crumbling, even as the bilateral relationship becomes more toxic, in order to try and limit damage to its economic recovery.”
The Trump administration has repeatedly upped the ante in its effort to pressure China, from imposing punitive tariffs to moving to kneecap Huawei Technologies Co. to shutting down the consulate -- one of the worst blows to diplomatic relations in four decades of relations. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has cast the fight in ideological terms, saying Thursday that “securing our freedoms from the Chinese Communist Party is the mission of our time.”
The heated rhetoric sparked panic buying in China on Friday, with the CSI 300 Index falling 4.4% at the close while the ChiNext Index dropped 6.1%, the most since Feb. 3. China’s yuan fell to the weakest since July 8.
Deal ‘Intact’
For China, the trade deal serves as important cushion for its own economic recovery. The truce agreed in January lifted the threat of higher tariffs on Chinese exports, which has been all the more critical given the collapse in shipments triggered by the pandemic. Both exports and imports improved in June, helping to solidify a broader recovery in the world’s second-biggest economy.
“China is working very hard to honor its promises,” said Jiang Yuechun, a senior research fellow with the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, a research institute connected with the Foreign Ministry. “We always say that economic relations are actually the ballast for China-U.S. relations. Now the ballast is becoming weaker and weaker, and that is why now the ship of China-U.S. relations is going up and down.”
U.S. Move on Houston Consulate Risks American Footprint in China
At the January signing of the trade deal, in which China pledged to spend $200 billion to close the trade imbalance, Trump said the nations were “righting the wrongs of the past.” Even as the pandemic put China way behind on planned purchases, the U.S. president has still backed the deal. Last month, after one of his advisers made comments indicating the agreement was in jeopardy, Trump tweeted that the deal was “fully intact.”
One reason the deal has held up is because economic officials in both Washington and Beijing are more pragmatic in their approach given the economic consequences at play, according to Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong.
“Compared to diplomacy and international relations, the economic portfolio is in the hands of less hawkish people on both sides,” Kuijs said. “The more that overall relations deteriorate, the more important the trade deal is as the one area where the two sides interact and discuss things relatively constructively, thereby providing a narrow pathway to maintaining dialogue between the world’s two largest economies.”
Global banks and asset managers are ramping up investments in China even amid the political tensions. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. was approved last month to take full ownership of its China futures unit, while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). in March won clearance to take majority control of their onshore securities ventures.
Xi Reassures Global CEOs as Trump Steps Up Push to Isolate China
President Xi Jinping has made personal appeals to foreign companies to stay in China, telling global CEOs in a letter this month that his government would look to “provide a more sound business environment for Chinese and overseas investors.” His administration has also resisted slapping sanctions on a wide range of U.S. companies despite threatening more than a year ago to release an “unreliable entities” list.
‘Hot Tempers’
In shuttering the U.S.’s Chengdu consulate Friday, the Foreign Ministry said the downturn in ties “is not what China desires to see.” Those sentiments were echoed by Hu Xijin, editor of the Communist Party’s Global Times newspaper, who wrote that China had to take reciprocal action but “obviously does not want China-U.S. relations to fall in a free fall.”
China Orders U.S. to Close Chengdu Consulate in Retaliation Move
Scuppering the trade deal could lead to another round of tit-for-tat tariffs, sanctions and visa restrictions that will damage both economies even more as they look to recover from the pandemic, according to Kelsey Broderick, an analyst at Eurasia Group. Moreover, she said, “the risk of an accidental military clash goes up with hot tempers on both sides.”
Still, for now it looks like both Trump and Xi want to avoid that. Officials from both China and the U.S. have repeatedly reaffirmed the commitment to the trade deal, and neither side sees much advantage at the moment in giving it up, said James Green, a former U.S. trade official in Beijing who is now a senior adviser for geopolitical consulting firm McLarty Associates.
“For the U.S., there is little expectation at the cabinet secretary level that ending the agreement will lead to any additional advances, so best to stick with it,” he said. “On the Chinese side they will hunker down until November, moving tit-for-tat on non-trade areas and avoiding strategic choices until after the election.”"

Investing.com -- Fears for the U.S. economic recovery send a chill through markets. The dollar hits a two-year low against the euro and other currencies after weak labor market data, signs of a delay to the next stimulus package and hawkish words on China from Donald Trump. China's stock market falls heavily. The euro hits a 22-month high as the eurozone economy returns to growth. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock slumps after announcing another delay to a key project, and  Disney  is also struggling to deliver on its pipeline of money-spinning movies. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, July 24th.
1. Fears for U.S. rebound as labor market, stimulus talks stall
Concerns that the U.S. economic recovery may be faltering sent a chill through global markets, hitting risk assets and supporting havens.
 The yield on the U.S. 10-Year Treasury note fell to 0.56%. It has only ever closed below that level once, back in April. Gold futures, however, failed to break through the $1,900 level for the second day in a row.
The move was triggered on Thursday by a combination of a rise in weekly initial jobless claims and a fresh delay to the announcement of Republican plans for the next package of stimulus measures. These will now only be published next week, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
2. Chinese markets fall as Trump threatens trade deal
Another factor weighing on risk assets is the latest diplomatic spat between China and the U.S.  Beijing ordered the U.S. to close its consulate in Chengdu in a tit-for-tat response to Washington’s closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston at the start of the week.
At his press briefing on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to prepare the ground for further trade measures against China, saying that the phased trade deal that the two countries signed at the start of the year “means less to me now than when I made it,” due to China’s role in the spread of the coronavirus.
Chinese stocks reacted badly to the threat, the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 falling 4.4% to its lowest in three weeks. The dollar, meanwhile, rose to a three-week high of 7.0236 yuan before retracing slightly.
3. Euro hits 22-month high as eurozone returns to growth
The dollar lost ground against many other currencies, however, strengthening suspicions that it is in for an extended decline against developed-world currencies after giving up its interest rate premium and now also appearing to be on the brink of another economic relapse.
The dollar index which tracks the greenback against a basket of six developed currencies, took out its April low to hit its lowest level since September 2018. The euro, in particular, gained across the board, breaking through $1.16 for the first time in nearly two years.
The single currency was also underpinned by the release of stronger-than-expected purchasing manager indices across the continent. IHS Markit’s composite Eurozone PMI rose to 54.8 in July from 48.1 in June, a reading that suggests the economy stopped shrinking at the start of the third quarter.
In the U.K., meanwhile, the bounce in retail sales finally arrived: they rose 13.9% in June, although the Office for National Statistics warned that consumption is still running well below pre-Covid-19 levels.
4. Stocks set to open lower; Earnings bandwagon rolls on
U.S. stock markets are set to open lower and appear likely to stay under pressure until either the U.S.-China newsflow improves or Congress can make more substantial progress on the next stimulus package.
The rise in jobless claims last week has focused market attention on the risk to domestic consumption if the current support for the millions of newly-unemployed is allowed to expire at the end of the month.
By 6:35 AM ET (1035 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 61 points or 0.2%, while the S&P 500 Futures contract was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was down 0.9%
Today’s earnings highlights include updates from Verizon (NYSE:VZ), NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE),  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). Honeywell (NYSE:HON) has already published, with earnings some 4% ahead of expectations
5. Intel, Disney disappoint with delays
Investors will be hoping that those companies can serve up better news than Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) did after the close on Thursday.  Intel stock was down 11.8% in premarket trade after announcing another delay to production of its new generation of 7-nanometer chips.
The company said it may not be able to start making the chips until early 2023.
The shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose 5.8% in premarket trade.
Elsewhere in the corporate space, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock was down 1.8% after the entertainment giant said it would delay the release of its new Mulan movie, as well as the next instalments of the Star Wars and Avatar franchises.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's government has launched a plan aimed at boosting its export sector to alleviate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, with a goal of increasing exports to 53% of gross domestic product by 2030 from 44% last year.
Announced late on Thursday, the ambitious plan is set to include various measures to help firms access more foreign markets, diversify exports and hire internationally oriented specialists.
It would also include a financing line to increase foreign demand for Portuguese products, as well as a range of tax incentives such as exemption from stamp duty for export credit insurance backed by the government.
""We're experiencing a particularly difficult situation and we want to increase the height of the export sector,"" Eurico Brilhante Dias, Secretary of State for Internationalisation, told reporters.
""We want a 20% to 25% increase in the number of companies that export goods,"" he said.
The pandemic is set to leave long-lasting scars on Portugal's economy, which was propelled back to growth by exports and booming tourism after a 2010-14 economic and debt crisis.
Last year, exports of goods and services rose 4.3% to a record of 93.5 billion euros ($108.5 billion), representing 44% of GDP.
However, the coronavirus pandemic has already led to an abrupt drop in exports, with the country's central bank predicting they will fall around 25% in 2020, mainly because tourism collapsed due to lockdowns and the absence of holidaymakers.
The central bank sees Portuguese GDP contracting 9.5% in 2020, after growing 2.2% in 2019.
Portugal has more than 35,000 exporting companies, of which more than 22,000 are exporters of goods.

Before the pandemic struck, London's transport operator TfL relied mostly on income from fares to run tubes, buses and trains, and invest in new projects, and unlike most other capital cities, did not receive any grant from central government.
But the government stepped in to help it after the coronavirus outbreak pushed its income down by 90% due to official advice for people to avoid public transport at the height of the pandemic between March and July. 
That advice has now been changed, but TfL said passenger numbers remained low and it expected public transport usage to remain down for the foreseeable future.
TfL said it would need funding of 2 billion pounds for the second half of the year, up to 300 million pounds more than it outlined in an earlier emergency budget. 
""There remains a large degree of uncertainty around future social distancing assumptions and the threat of a further pandemic-related suppression of demand,"" it said in a statement on Friday. 
TfL also said it needed longer-term certainty from government on future funding to allow it to continue to invest in projects to help reduce car usage. 
""TfL’s revised budget, should sufficient funding be provided by the government in the months ahead, will keep services running safely and support London’s recovery from the pandemic,” said London's mayor Sadiq Khan.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan urban farmer Francis Wachira credits a soil recycling company with keeping him afloat financially during the coronavirus crisis: it helped him to start producing herbs and vegetables on his tiny Nairobi plot.
The locally-owned company, Sprout Organic, mixes animal bone meal, seeds, foliage, dry leaves, twigs and kitchen waste like banana peels, to concoct a composite that is then sold to urban farmers like Wachira to grow food in small spaces.
Wachira, 71, used to make a living by renting out tiny tin shacks he built, but the coronavirus pandemic meant his tenants could no longer pay him. 
Now he sells the produce from his plot, such as kale, spinach and herbs, and says he earns around 1,000 shillings ($9.23).
""We are making good money out of this,"" he said.
Ted Gachanga, an agronomist who co-owns Sprout, says their product resembles black cotton soil. Worms are usually added to the mixture to help it mature, a process that takes about four weeks.
A 20 kg bag sells at 3,500 shillings. Gachanga said demand had risen by 10% during the pandemic, which has cut incomes and impinged food supply chains.
""People are seeing the need to grow their own produce,"" Gachanga said.
Close to 15,000 people in Kenya have been infected by the COVID-19 disease since the first case was reported in mid-March, official data showed. Economic growth has slowed down sharply, with many job losses in sectors like tourism.
Sprout employs three staff, and its owners say that although their technology is not new, they have patented the formula for the composite. They hope to expand production beyond Nairobi to cover other towns. 

""Anybody can be an urban farmer,"" said Michael Kanywiria, a co-owner of Sprout.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's economy is expected to contract this year for the first time in more than a decade as the coronavirus pandemic and related restrictions hit demand, but will bounce back next year, according to a Reuters poll published on Friday.
The median forecast in a July 21-23 survey of 42 economists in and outside the country was for a contraction of 4.3% in 2020, with drops in the second and third quarters of 12.2% and 3.1% respectively.
But the Turkish economy is expected to grow next year by 4.5%, according to the median forecast. 
""We are seeing a U-shaped recovery in the Turkish economy right now ... However, the uncertainties about a possible second wave of the outbreak necessitates a cautious approach to these economic recovery scenarios,"" said Enver Erkan, economist at Tera Yatirim.
There are downside risks to growth next year, Erkan said, adding that tensions between the United States and China will have an impact too.
""I am not saying everything will be alright in 2021, we will be in a process of changing back,"" he said.
The government had forecast 5% economic growth this year before the coronavirus outbreak and has since maintained the economy could still grow this year, following a robust 4.5% expansion in the first quarter.
But economic activity declined sharply in the second quarter as Ankara shut schools and some businesses, closed borders and adopted weekend lockdowns to slow the spread of the coronavirus. It has started taking steps to re-open the economy since June.
POLICY RATE
Turkey's economy last contracted on an annual basis in 2009, by 4.7%. From 2010 to 2018, its average growth rate was more than 5% thanks mainly to a construction boom driven by cheap capital following the global financial crisis.
A currency crisis in 2018 was set off by concerns over central bank independence and tensions between Ankara and Washington. That led to three straight quarters of economic contraction and a modest annual growth rate of 0.9% last year.
Since last year, the central bank has cut rates to 8.25% from 24%, at first to pull the economy out a recession and later to counter the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
In the poll, economists predicted the central bank would cut its policy rate to 8.00% by the end of this year.
It has bought up government debt at record levels since the end of March in the face of the outbreak. Economists have said the bond buying scheme and use of reserves to boost the Turkish lira have left the central bank with less room to manoeuvre.
""(The central bank moves) bears the risk of raising inflation, further deteriorating investor confidence and triggering another balance-of-payments crisis,"" Allianz (DE:ALVG) said in a note.
Allianz predicts Turkey will return to its pre-crisis level of GDP in mid-2022.
Inflation, which has hovered around 12% the last few months, was expected to decline to 10.2% by the end of the year and to 9.9% by the end of 2021.
The current account balance, which recorded a rare surplus last year as the economy slowed, has since returned to a deficit. The deficit is expected to stand at 2.3% of GDP this year and next, according to the poll.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Denmark, Norway and Sweden face among their worst economic downturns on record this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but will largely recover the lost ground in 2021, according to a Reuters poll of economists.
The economic hit looks slightly worse than was expected in an April poll, with much of the region on course to see the biggest contraction in a single year since World War Two.
The region's export-orientated economies are built on trade, and major exporters like truckmaker AB Volvo (ST:VOLVb), shipping giant Maersk (CO:MAERSKb) and oil company Equinor (OL:EQNR) have been hamstrung by the pandemic, which closed businesses and disrupted global supply chains.
Sweden and Norway's gross domestic product is likely to contract by 5.0% and 4.5% respectively in 2020, according to median predictions in the July 21-23 poll, the biggest drop since World War Two. Denmark's economy is expected to shrink by 4.3%, its worst contraction since the financial crisis in 2009.
Governments and central banks have pumped money into their economies in a bid to fight the crippling effect of the pandemic. Norway cut its key interest rate to a record low in May, while Sweden's Riksbank has vastly expanded bond-buying schemes and kept its key rate at zero.
Yet a rapid turnaround is forecast for 2021, better so than expected in an April poll, with percentage growth rates almost matching this year's losses as restrictions are lifted and the effects of fiscal stimulus kick in.
Sweden is predicted to grow 3.9% next year, Norway 4.0% and Denmark 3.8%, although job growth looks slow, with the forecasts showing only minor falls in unemployment between 2020 and 2021. 
Although the region has suffered economically from the pandemic, it is doing better than many other countries in Europe and beyond, said Robert Bergqvist, chief economist at SEB bank.
However he warned predictions for 2021 were ""surrounded by great uncertainty"", with variables including how other parts of the world fared and whether there was a second wave of coronavirus infections in the coming winter. 
""How Europe, the U.S and Asia recover is very important for the Nordics, as the region is dependent on the global economy,"" he said, adding that the Swedish government was likely to announce further stimulus packages in September.
""Sweden is hoping that it would be less impacted by a second wave,"" Bergqvist said, referring to the country's decision to forego a national lockdown, in contrast to the rest of the region. 
Access to a vaccine is what will be most crucial, he added, as that would help recovery in other countries that the region exports to and trades with. 

The poll was of 29 economists for Sweden, 26 for Norway and 15 for Denmark.

1664,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>","Twenty years on, Japan government's digital ambitions still stuck in piles of paper","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Two decades after Japan rolled out an ambitious plan to go digital, the COVID-19 crisis has exposed the government's deeply rooted technological shortcomings as ministries remain stuck in a paper-driven culture that experts say is hurting productivity. 
While Tokyo has made ""digital transformation"" its main policy plank this year, the switch may not prove so easy as bureaucrats from different ministries still aren't able to hold teleconferences together and little of their administrative work can be done online.
Analysts say the lack of government digitalisation could reduce the incentive for the private sector to go digital in a blow to Japan's efforts to boost productivity.
""Lack of digital investment by the government has hampered productivity and efficiency at the private sector,"" said Takuya Hoshino, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
In its mid-year policy strategy, the government vowed to accelerate digitalisation of its outdated administration, which has delayed delivery of cash payouts to help citizens weather the pandemic.
Much of the problem stems from Japan's preference for paper documents and seal for approval at government offices.
""Paper documents and seal are still prevalent. Politicians whom I deal with also prefer face-to-face meetings,"" a government official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Adding to its digital woes is Japan's vertically structured bureaucracy: each ministry as well as local governments, for instance, have developed their own computer systems that aren't compatible with each other.
Currently, each ministry has developed its own LAN network with various vendors, making it difficult to hold teleconference with each other because of differences in their on-line security policy, a Cabinet Office official in charge of IT strategy, who declined to be named, told Reuters. 
In Japan, less than 12% of administrative work is transacted online, according to Japan Research Institute.
Overall, it could cost the government 323 million working hours per year if it doesn't go digital, translating into personnel costs of nearly $8 billion, a government regulatory reform panel estimated in a report released in July last year.
The digital drawbacks give the lie to Japan's image as one of the world's leading high-tech nations - in fact, the world's third-biggest economy ranked 23rd among 63 countries, lagging behind some Asian nations like Singapore, South Korea and China in a survey by Swiss think tank IMD on digital competitiveness.
The last OECD Digital Economy Outlook put Japan at the lowest rank among 31 countries in on-line procedures, with just 5.4% of citizens utilising digital applications at public offices, way below Denmark, Estonia and Iceland at around 70%.
Seiji Kihara, a former Ministry of Finance official who now serves as ruling party's deputy policy chief, said young bureaucrats were running around with a pile of documents seeking bosses' seal for approval when he was there twenty years ago.

""They are doing pretty much the same now.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy is expected to recover steadily in the rest of the year, boosted by stimulus measures to reverse the damage from the coronavirus crisis, but weak global demand and rising Sino-U.S. tensions are key risks, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
The world's second-biggest economy is now expected to expand by 2.2% in 2020, according to the median of 42 analysts surveyed by Reuters, up from 1.8% projected in the last poll in April.
But that pace would still be the weakest since 1976 - the final year of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution.
China's economy expanded 3.2% in the second quarter from a year earlier, following a record 6.8% slump in the first three months of the year as the virus and strict measures to contain it paralysed much of the country.
But analysts warn that the rebound is heavily reliant on state-led investment, while consumption remains weak. National disposable income per capita fell 1.3% in the first half of the year, according to official data.
Manufacturing and construction have snapped back relatively quickly, thanks largely to a massive infrastructure push and a rebound in homebuilding. But the services sector has lagged, with the catering, hospitality and entertainment sectors struggling to get back to normal amid worries of a resurgence of coronavirus cases and cautious consumer sentiment.
Exports have improved somewhat, largely due to massive demand for medical gear as the rest of the world battles the pandemic, though the shock of the health crisis is expected to depress global demand for some time to come.
""We still see growth uncertainties ahead from a bumpy and uneven reopening in other countries, a less favourable policy environment, and the loss of strong growth driver in consumption/services amid elevated uncertainty in the labour market,"" said analysts from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). 
Deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing are also clouding the outlook, though a Phase 1 trade deal signed earlier this year still appears to be intact. 
In a dramatic worsening of ties this week, the United States demanded China shut its Houston consulate on accusations of ""intellectual property theft"". China on Friday ordered the U.S. to close its consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu.
""Heightened U.S.-China tension, supply chain decoupling pressures and a subdued profit outlook could hit corporate sentiment and depress trade and manufacturing activities,"" UBS Economist Tao Wang said.
FISCAL STIMULUS TO SPUR GROWTH
With the economy on the mend, China's central bank does not see an immediate need to ease monetary policy further, but will keep conditions accommodative to support the recovery, policy sources told Reuters.
Analysts expect China will lower its one-year loan prime rate (LPR) by another 10 basis points (bps) to 3.75% by the end of 2020. It has been cut by 46 bps since last August.
The poll also predicted no change to the current benchmark deposit rate. The PBOC has kept it untouched at 1.5% since October 2015.
""Economic activity continued to strengthen going into Q3, and fiscal policy is set to boost activity for the remainder of the year,"" Martin Rasmussen, China Economist with Capital Economics said in a note.
""That should allow the PBOC to step back from easing and instead focus on the financial risks that have accumulated this year."" 
China's consumer price index (CPI) in 2020 will likely rise 2.7% from the previous year, slowing from a 2.9% rise in 2019, according to the poll. 

Analysts with Nomura predicted higher food prices in coming weeks as much of the country is battered by torrential rain and floods, but said the impact will likely be short-lived.

The president, at a White House coronavirus briefing on Thursday evening, again complained that the U.S. had to shut down its economy to protect against the virus.
“The trade deal means less to me now than when I made it,” Trump said.
Trump has sought to pin blame on China for the outbreak as polls show a growing number of voters disapprove of his handling of the pandemic.
The president has taken a number of actions designed to punish the Beijing government over the virus and other issues, including its efforts to curtail political freedoms in Hong Kong and the detention of roughly 1 million minority Muslims.
Trump ordered an end to Hong Kong’s special status after determining that a new Chinese national security law meant that the former British colony was no longer autonomous. He also signed a law authorizing sanctions against officials responsible for cracking down on political dissent in the city, weeks after he signed a similar law aimed at those involved in repressing Uighur Muslims.
And this week, in one of the biggest threats to diplomatic ties between the countries in decades, the U.S. gave China three days to close down its consulate in Houston, the fourth largest American city.
The State Department said it had ordered the shutdown “to protect American intellectual property and Americans’ private information,” without giving more details. China has vowed to retaliate.
The U.S. Justice Department has also intensified a crackdown on Chinese hackers and researchers. On Tuesday, the department accused two men of working with the Chinese government to target companies developing vaccines for the coronavirus and stealing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of intellectual property and trade secrets from companies across the world.
Yet the president has indicated to aides that he doesn’t want to further escalate tensions with Beijing, and has ruled out for now additional sanctions on other top Chinese officials, according to people familiar with the matter.
Inflaming the conflict with China could create new headwinds for the U.S. economy, which has already been battered by the pandemic, and possibly upend the trade agreement that Trump brokered with Chinese President Xi Jingping.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. economic outlook has darkened in the past month amid renewed lockdowns in some states from surging coronavirus cases, according to economists in a Reuters poll who warned of a high risk the job recovery underway reverses by year-end.
U.S. coronavirus cases approached 4 million on Thursday, with over 2,600 new cases every hour on average, the highest rate in the world, and some state governments have reimposed restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.
That has raised concerns about the sustainability of the recent rebound in hiring and other economic data, as the world's largest economy, which was propping up global growth before the pandemic, climbs out of a deep hole.
The July 13-22 poll showed the economy contracted 33.8% last quarter on an annualised basis but while it was expected to bounce back with 17.8% growth this quarter and expand 6.5% in the following three months, that was weaker than the 18.5% and 8.0% respective growth predictions made a month ago.
""The current situation presents two risks: Some states might need to shut down more consumer activity to get the virus under control, and the stall in the reopening process might cause longer-term damage to businesses and the labor market,"" said David Mericle, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
Goldman recently lowered its Q3 growth forecast to 25%, still well above the poll median, from 33% previously. Several banks have reduced their Q3 forecasts in succession in recent months. 
(Reuters Poll: U.S. economy growth and unemployment outlook - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/bdwvkedqxvm/US%20economy.PNG)
In the latest poll, a majority either downgraded or left their forecasts unchanged from last month, with the magnitude on average of those downgrades much bigger than the upgrades, disputing the ""V""-shaped recovery expected by financial markets.
Asked for the worst-case scenario for the world's largest economy, the median response was for a 40.4% contraction in Q2, no growth in the following two quarters, a 9.0% contraction in 2020 and no growth in 2021.
The wider poll suggested weaker growth next year, with medians downgraded for the first half of 2021 compared with the June poll.
Nearly two-thirds of economists, or 35 of 56 who responded to an additional question, said it would take two or more years for the U.S. economy to reach its pre-COVID-19 levels. 
The others said it would take place in one to two years, with no respondent predicting it to take less than a year.
Following an unprecedented amount of monetary easing and fiscal spending, discussions about additional government measures are underway.
In the meantime, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at a record low of 0-0.25% until at least 2023. Forecasts for all measures of inflation barely changed in the latest Reuters poll.
""Even as the Fed maintains its ultra-loose policy stance and Congress provides further fiscal support, ongoing social distancing requirements are likely to keep GDP well below its pre-virus trend and the unemployment rate elevated over the coming years,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
All but one of 60 economists said the outlook for the strength of the U.S. economic recovery had either remained about the same or worsened over the past month.
Nearly 60%, or 32 of 56 economists, said the risk the job recovery underway reverses by the end of this year was high or very high. Twenty-three said the risk was low, while only one said it was very low.
""Epidemiologists believe there is a strong likelihood of a second wave of infections in the fall/early winter. This is a typical pattern for respiratory infections,"" said Daniel Bachman, senior U.S. economist at Deloitte, who forecasts a renewed contraction in the fourth quarter, by 9.8%, the most pessimistic view in the poll.
""It's not certain such a second wave will occur - but if it does, we believe this could suppress economic activity and give us a negative fourth quarter. Since the epidemiological analysis has the second wave as likely, we include it as an assumption in our baseline forecast.""

Having briefly shown signs of recovery in recent months from its deepest recession on record, the Asian financial hub is bracing for its stiffest test yet as a resurgent virus combines with an increasingly uncertain political and financial outlook.
Hong Kong is facing fundamental questions about its long-term role as an international finance center, amid signs that tech firms are abandoning the city and global companies are spurning its once-vaunted legal system after imposition of a national security law. While that’s happening, the more immediate prospects for growth are deteriorating by the day as the coronavirus case count spikes.
“There is no light at the end of the tunnel; we have written off any possible chance of profits for the rest of the year,” said Douglas Young, co-founder and chief executive of lifestyle and fashion retail chain Goods of Desire. “In the long term, I am optimistic that we shall get over this crisis, but our lives will be different.”
Hong Kong will have an update on July 29 on where things stand when the government reports second-quarter economic growth figures. Economists forecast an 8.7% contraction from year-ago levels, almost equaling the record 8.9% decline posted in the first quarter.
Hong Kong reported a record 111 local virus cases Thursday, according to local officials. The government has extended civil servants’ work-from-home plan for another week, to Aug. 2, according to a statement on its website.
While urging residents to stay at home, Hong Kong’s government as yet has not mandated a full lockdown.
Empty storefronts are becoming a common scene in the city’s shopping districts, where a little more than a year ago they were packed with tourists. Those shoppers disappeared amid months of street protests and then border lockdowns triggered by the coronavirus.
Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island had a vacancy rate of 7.9% in the second quarter, compared with zero a year earlier, while Mong Kok in Kowloon has a vacancy rate of 24%, quadruple that of a year ago, according to property broker Cushman & Wakefield Plc. The firm expects the rate to continue to rise in most retail districts in the second half.
“I am not feeling optimistic about the outlook for the city because there are lots of uncertainties,” said Tommy Wu, senior economist with Oxford Economics in Hong Kong. He forecasts a 9.5% contraction year-on-year in the second quarter, and a 6% decline in GDP for 2020. “If the third wave of virus infections prolongs, I would expect a much greater wave of business closures in the coming months.”
Slow Traffic
Syed Asim Hussain, co-founder of hospitality group Black Sheep Restaurants, which operates 25 restaurants in Hong Kong and employs about 1,000 people, said about 80% of sales have been erased by the latest virus restrictions that include a ban on dining in after 6 p.m.
Hussain and co-founder Christopher Mark have avoided laying off staff this year yet have implemented salary reductions.
“The short-term outlook does not look good,” he said of the prospects for Hong Kong’s restaurant industry. “We have been lobbying the government for support, a little bit more support with the landlords.”
Some landlords such as Edwin Lee, CEO of Bridgeway Prime Shop Fund Management, said they are offering tenants rent reductions of as much as 50%. “It’s better than letting them quit their businesses and leaving the shops vacant,” he said.
Rent is such a significant issue in Hong Kong that an extended lockdown might end up being preferable for some, as it could allow some retailers to declare force majeure and relieve their lease burden, said Samy Redjeb, managing director with luxury brands distributor The Bluebell Group.
“The only positive of Hong Kong was the pandemic was under control until the end of June, when sales picked up slightly, and now that is gone,” Redjeb said. “Borders are not re-opening soon and after a year of down trend, and the constant battle on rents, many retailers are facing difficult questions as to their future in the city. It’s extremely sad.”

1670,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 05:54PM ET</span>","U.S. Economy’s Recovery Is Stalling, and It Could Get Even Worse","(Bloomberg) -- The official numbers have begun to confirm what many Americans feel in their bones: the economy is buckling once again.
Despite assurances from the Trump administration that better times are at hand, the worsening pandemic is restraining or even snuffing out the economy’s nascent recovery. From restaurant dining to air travel and now to filings for unemployment benefits, a growing body of evidence indicates America’s rebound from the pandemic is stalling days before hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of federal aid is set to expire.
Lawmakers may eventually iron out an agreement on a new stimulus package, but for now they remain far apart on many of the key details. Whether the talks are ultimately successful or not, one thing is now crystal clear: Until a vaccine or effective treatment for Covid-19 is available, the world’s largest economy will at best post tepid, uneven growth and, at worst, endure an extended period of malaise or even a depression.
“If lawmakers don’t quickly pass another sizable rescue package that includes help to state and local governments and more income support to the unemployed, then the economy will suffer another downturn -- a so-called double-dip,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “Unemployment will remain in the double digits until well after the pandemic is over.”
The jobless claims report was so grim -- with the ranks of those filing for benefits swelling to 1.42 million -- that it even got the attention of stock investors, a group that has been blissfully impervious to bad news of late. They pushed the S&P 500 Index down 1.2% on Thursday, marking the biggest decline in almost a month.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“The fiscal response to the Covid-19 recession is running out of steam just as the rising virus case count impinges on the recovery. The most critical near-term deadline is for enhanced jobless benefits, set to run out at the end of July. A range of other programs will also need to be expanded and extended if policy is to avoid swinging from recovery driver to recessionary drag.”
-- Andrew Husby

Democrats have proposed a $3.5 trillion package of virus relief that has already passed the House. Senate Republicans are working on a roughly $1 trillion plan, but disagreements within the GOP have bogged down a detailed proposal. That’s not expected until Monday, and negotiating a compromise with Democrats may run through the first week in August.
While the report also showed a decline in continuing claims that suggests hiring has picked up, the rise in layoffs from an already-elevated level is a sign the labor market is going in the wrong direction. That could make President Donald Trump’s case for reelection even tougher than polls already show.

“This is definitely something that we’re studying very closely, looking into the underlying numbers to see if this is an anomaly or something more concerning,” Tyler Goodpseed, acting chairman of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, said Thursday on Bloomberg Television.
The unemployment figures followed mounting evidence of a stall in the recovery as coronavirus cases surged across much of the country over the past month. Key points from government and private reports include:
“We are seeing -- in the areas where Covid has come back in a significant way like California, Texas, Arizona -- mobility data weaken, small business data shows some softening as well as consumer spending,” Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). chief U.S. economist Michelle Meyer said.
If there’s a bright side, “there hasn’t been a collapse by any means” -- more of a “modest softening,” Meyer said. And if the reimposed social-distancing measures can help control the virus, “one would imagine that the mobility will pick up again and people will re-engage to some extent,” she said.
What CEOs Say
“We’re in an environment where it’s almost like we’re starting our business from scratch. We had very strong bookings in place for the third quarter, at the beginning of this month. Then over the last several weeks, with the spike in Covid-19 cases, we’ve seen the bookings slow down dramatically and we’ve also seen an increase in cancellations.” -- Southwest Airlines’ Gary Kelly, Thursday on Bloomberg TV.
“I don’t think any of us believe that we’re going to get even close to the old demand until there is a vaccine that’s widely spread.” -- American Airlines’ Douglas Parker, on earnings call Thursday.
“Customers and businesses have adapted to a new environment. Some have reopened in U.S., some have also been re-closed or limited again. We expect start-stop to be the base case as we look ahead.” -- Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan on July 17 earnings call.
Not everything is going in the wrong direction. Several gauges have shown expansion in regional manufacturing this month. Demand for home purchases has remained relatively strong, as measured by mortgage applications.
“The re-shutting of the economy is largely a retail phenomenon,” said Michael Englund of Action Economics LLC. “Production is continuing to accelerate.”
In addition, the decline in continuing jobless claims over the past few weeks indicated that July’s jobs report -- due Aug. 7 -- could very well show an increase in employment, though it’s far from guaranteed that gains would continue in August and beyond.
“The rate of separation remains extremely high, extraordinarily high,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc. “One report doesn’t make a trend, but that’s what we obviously would be concerned about.”

1672,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 04:20PM ET</span>",Column: U.S. rule could halt social investing in 401(k) plans in its tracks,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The idea of using investments to promote environmental and social causes has grown quickly in recent years, and retirement plans looked like the next frontier - until the Trump administration weighed in last month.
The U.S. Department of Labor (DoL) proposed a new rule governing the use in 401(k) plans of mutual funds driven by environmental, social and governance factors — so-called ESG investing. The rule would require plan sponsors to demonstrate they are not sacrificing financial performance for participants by adding ESG funds. Nothing wrong with that, insofar as it goes - clearly, the most important social good of a 401(k) plan is to build retirement savings for participants. 
But the proposed rule does not recognize that the current generation of socially conscious funds can deliver top-notch performance along with a dose of social progress. And importantly, the rule takes square aim at the best chance for ESG funds to take root in 401(k) plans by making it impossible for plan sponsors to offer them as the default investment option in plans - most of which use a target-date fund that automatically reduces exposure to stocks as retirement approaches. 
Prohibiting use of ESG funds as default options would be a huge obstacle for growth of ESG in 401(k) plans. 
""The prior guidance (from the Department of Labor) left some room for considering an ESG fund as a default option,"" said Mikaylee O’Connor, head of defined contribution solutions at RVK, a New York-based consulting firm that advises workplace retirement plans. “But based on the proposed regulation, this is likely not possible.”
WHY ESG FUNDS ARE DIFFERENT
The proposed ESG rule is out of step with trends in the investment world because it seeks to differentiate between doing good and doing well. That was a valid distinction years ago, when social investing was defined mainly by mutual funds with a theme (green investing) - or exclusion (no fossil fuels or weapons). The earlier wave of funds often underperform the market due to lack of broad exposure to market segments, high fees - or both. 
ESG funds are different. Most of them use ratings systems that score securities for their exposure to factors such as a company’s environmental impact, governance policies or how it treats employees or monitors its supply chains. The funds either underweight or eliminate securities that fund managers expect will have high risk associated with those factors, or tilt toward those that might have a positive impact.
This approach may not impress social investing purists, but growing evidence suggests that it lets investors have at least some of their cake and eat it too.
ESG funds actually have been turning in very strong numbers. Morningstar reports that during the extremely volatile first half of this year, 72% of ESG funds ranked in the top halves of their investment categories, and that all 26 ESG index funds outperformed their conventional index-fund counterparts (https:// Numbers like that underscore the disconnect in the proposed DoL rule for 401(k) plans, argues Aron Szapiro, director of policy research for Morningstar. And funds that lean toward climate-friendly or workplace diversity will do better over the long haul for younger workers, he argues.  “You can make a strong case that retirement investors who have multi-decade time horizons are the ones who really do need to be considering these factors,” he said.  The growth in ESG thus far has been concentrated mainly among institutional investors and high net-worth individuals. Many industry experts have looked to workplace retirement plans for the next big leg of growth. This is where the money is - workplace defined-contribution plans held a combined $7.9 trillion at the end of the first quarter this year, according to the Investment Company Institute.  “Retirement plans are one of the areas we really have identified as the next flow of assets,” said Lisa Woll, CEO of US SIF. “To the degree that most individuals have savings, it's in their retirement funds.” A leader pushing into the 401(k) market is fund provider Natixis, which launched its Sustainable Futures target date series a little over three years ago. Sustainable Futures has established a strong investment record, and more than 100 plans have incorporated the funds, according to Ed Farrington, head of retirement strategies at Natixis. “It’s very important that long-term investors have access to economically driven ESG strategies, because these are risks that will show up in stock price over time,” he said.  The DoL's proposed rule is on an unusually fast track as the agency tries to finalize it before the end of President Donald Trump’s term. That might not be possible - the agency is accepting comments through July 30 and industry observers say there will be plenty.  Said Farrington: “So far, it’s a proposal, not a rule.” For more on ESG investing in 401(k) plans, check out my podcast interview https:// this week with Aron Szapiro of Morningstar.

1673,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 03:10PM ET</span>",Fed broadens access to three emergency lending facilities,"(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday broadened access to three of its lending facilities designed to provide a credit backstop to firms hurt in the coronavirus crisis, allowing broker dealers that meet certain minimums to participate.
To get the programs -- the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) and Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) -- off the ground quickly, participation was initially limited to financial institutions that regularly deal with the central bank, known as primary dealers.
With Thursday's announcement, broker-dealers with net regulatory capital of at least $1 million, a minimum shareholders’equity of $1 million, and a track record in the targeted market may submit an expression of interest to be a vendor or counterparty for the Fed's facilities. 
Allowing broader distribution could help reach firms in corners of markets otherwise unable to access the credit they need, just as a surge of infections is making the economic landscape more difficult for firms in many parts of the country.
Use of the Fed's lending facilities has been tepid so far, though Fed officials credit their availability with having steadied financial markets initially rocked by the crisis. 

The CPFF, for instance had extended just over $4.25 billion at its peak about a month ago, but the latest outstanding loan balance is down to just $2.1 billion.

""I'm not going to be endorsing Judy's Shelton's nomination to the Fed,"" The Hill newspaper quoted Romney as telling reporters at the Capitol. ""I will be voting against her.""
The nomination of Shelton, who in the past has supported a return to the gold standard and had advocated the Fed be more inline with Trump's White House regarding monetary policy, was approved Tuesday by the Senate Banking Committee on a 13-12 party line vote. 
Shelton's nomination next needs confirmation by the Senate as a whole, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority. At least three Republicans would need to join Romney, one of the most vocal critics of Trump in his party, to block her joining the top ranks of the U.S. central bank.
North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer, who had joined Romney in sinking Trump's proposed nomination last year of former presidential candidate Herman Cain, said earlier this week that he would support Shelton. 
Democrats have raised concerns about placing the longtime Fed critic and Trump confidante in a position of influence over U.S. monetary policy. 
Republicans who support her have said they believe she supports the Fed's independence from politics, which U.S. central bankers say is key to their effectiveness and policy credibility.

St Louis Fed chief researcher Christopher Waller is also up for a Fed seat, but unlike Shelton he holds more conventional views on monetary policy and his nomination has bipartisan support.

1675,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>",U.S. ad market faces longer road to recovery as states' reopening efforts sputter,"By Sheila Dang
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Not so long ago, advertising executives were banking on the start of an industry recovery as early as the third quarter after the global coronavirus pandemic decimated marketing budgets this year. 
But the rebound will be slower than expected as the restart of the U.S. economy has stumbled across many states and COVID-19 infections have spiked in key regions including California, Florida and Texas. Ad market forecasters said they are likely to lower expectations for the year.
Just last month, analysts were expecting third-quarter U.S. ad sales to decline by 4.8% versus the year-ago quarter, which would have been an improvement over the 16.8% decline in the hard-hit second quarter. But now it appears the third quarter could be “significantly worse” than a 4.8% decline due to Americans continuing to work from home and sectors such as theaters and travel taking longer to recover, said Vincent Letang, executive vice president of global market intelligence at research firm MAGNA, a division of advertising conglomerate Interpublic Group of Companies Inc (N:IPG).
MAGNA, which said the second quarter would be the worst of the year, last month also estimated the fourth quarter would recover and likely be flat from the previous year. 
""It's probably not realistic at the moment, but it's still early to tell,"" Letang said of the fourth-quarter forecast. 
Early signs of an economic rebound taking longer are already trickling in. Major advertiser  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) said on Tuesday it could take the global economy ""two to three years to fully recover.""
The ad market is expected to gradually stabilize with each passing quarter, said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at ad agency GroupM. But recent improvements in travel, a major advertising category, have started to flatten again over the past two weeks as virus cases increased across the United States, according to ad buying agency UM, a unit of IPG, which has been tracking consumer demand. 
The market is clearly looking for any signs of improvement. Shares of  Publicis Groupe  SA (PA:PUBP), the world's third-largest advertising group, rose as much as 16% on Thursday when the company reported second-quarter underlying sales falling 13%, beating more dire expectations by analysts.
But uncertainties around the pandemic clouded Publicis' ability to provide full-year guidance. 
Even  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google, which collectively dominate the digital ad market and have weathered cycles better than traditional ad platforms, are unlikely to be immune, according to analyst estimates.
Digital advertising in the United States is expected to grow 1.7% this year, which was downgraded from a previous estimate of 17% growth, according to research firm eMarketer. Digital ad spending in the United States totaled $124.6 billion in 2019, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau. 
The total U.S. ad market amounted to $241.2 billion in 2019, and is expected to decline 13% this year when excluding political advertising, according to GroupM. 
Google, which reports second-quarter earnings later on Thursday, and Facebook, which reports next week, will provide important signals for the current state of the ad industry, said Nicole Perrin, an eMarketer analyst.
""I wouldn’t be surprised if we revise downward again because reopening is going worse than we predicted in early June,"" she said, referring to projections for the advertising market. 
Other factors weighing on Facebook include an unprecedented advertiser boycott organized to pressure the world’s largest social network to find a better way to block hate speech and misinformation.
The return of live sports and other events will boost a recovery next year, Letang said. But even with a vaccine, the impact of the coronavirus on consumer confidence could be long-lasting.

""Even if economic activity comes back to where it’s supposed to be by 2022, there will be some changes in lifestyles ... that point to lower advertising activity,"" he said.

1676,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 01:30PM ET</span>","Unemployment's second wave? Stodgy reopening, virus surge may undercut U.S. jobs","By Howard Schneider
(Reuters) - A stodgy U.S. recovery showed little sign of accelerating over the last week with hints emerging that the quick job gains of May and June may be fading, according to high frequency data and analysis from companies, forecasters and government analysts.
With some states reimposing restrictions on commerce, particularly tighter rules around bar and restaurant openings, an additional 1.4 million people filed for unemployment insurance - the first time since March and the imposition of a national state of emergency that new claims have risen from the prior week.
Expectations of millions of additional jobs being added in July are ""too optimistic and we may flatline after two months of sharp improvement,"" said Karim Basta, chief economist at III Capital Management.
That would leave the U.S. still about 14 million jobs shy of where it was in February. About 32 million are collecting weekly unemployment benefits that may be drastically curtailed in coming weeks when expanded federal payments expire, a further blow to the economy's spending power during the ongoing pandemic recession. 
The economy did add more than 7 million jobs in May and June as firms brought workers back from furloughs and hired anew on hopes the coronavirus was controlled and the economy on the verge of a steady rebound.
But threats to any further large recovery in jobs could be seen elsewhere.
Data from employee time management firm Kronos showed growth in workshifts across a variety of industries has largely stalled since late June in regions outside the Northeast, where the virus hit hard in March and April but has remained relatively contained amid a surge in other parts of the country. 
Graphic: Factory shifts may be slowing Factory shifts may be slowing - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/SHIFTS/dgkvldwzmvb/chart.png
Small business hiring may have plateaued. Data from Homebase, whose users are heavily concentrated among small employers and particularly restaurants, showed the number of workers on the job fell slightly for the week through July 19 and has been largely flat since June.
Federal Reserve officials have cited Homebase as one of the newer high frequency data sources they are monitoring, and a St. Louis Fed employment forecast keyed off of that information shows employment overall falling in July. 
Graphic: A July jobs dip? - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-FED/SMALLBIZ/gjnpwxemkvw/chart.png
Other recent data were mixed, adding to evidence that the U.S. recovery remains tepid for now as states struggle to contain the pandemic and consumers and businesses parse through how to safely operate.
More states and companies for example are mandating masks, a simple step that health officials say could allow a broader range of activities to continue at less risk to public health.
J.P. Morgan economist Jesse Edgerton said there may be initial hints the message is taking hold. Earlier this summer, he wrote in a Wednesday analysis, the link between in-person credit spending at restaurants and growth in coronavirus cases two weeks later seemed convincingly large; it has weakened in recent days ""suggesting that increased precautions like mask-wearing and outdoor dining are beginning to break the link between economic activity and virus spread.""
Still, credit card spending has remained flat so far over the month, he said, ""suggesting that the rapid economic rebound seen in May and early June has lost momentum but not reversed."" 
Measures of traffic to stores rose last week, with cellphone tracking firms Unacast and Safegraph both showing more trips to retail locations. Unacast estimated retail visits were within 15% of 2019 levels through the week ended July 18. 
Broader indicators of the economy were largely flat. A Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) measure of industrial activity improved slightly but a consumer index was unchanged. The New York Fed Weekly Economic Index fell slightly.
Oxford Economics' recovery tracker fell slightly, its third decline in the last five weeks, driven down by the rise in coronavirus cases and deaths, and weakening measures of demand.

""While the rebounds in retail sales, employment, and industrial production through June were alluring, policymakers should not fall under the spell of rear-view-mirror economics,"" Oxford analysts wrote. ""As of mid-July, the economy is emerging quite frail from its first rehabilitation phase, and the risks of a renewed downfall are real.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republican leaders and White House officials tried to hammer out a proposal for a fresh round of coronavirus aid on Thursday, which officials said will not include a payroll tax cut and could reduce an enhanced unemployment benefit.
Republicans have been trying for days to agree on a negotiating position, a preliminary step to hashing out details with Democrats who control the House of Representatives, which in May passed a proposed $3 trillion response plan that the Senate declined to take up.
Democratic leaders, meanwhile, rejected the idea of passing a piecemeal bill.
The talks continue as U.S. coronavirus cases passed the 4 million mark, a milestone of a pandemic that has killed more than 143,000 Americans and thrown tens of millions out of work.
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Capitol Hill, a day after hammering out Republican agreements in principle on portions of a potential coronavirus-response bill, which could be presented to Democrats as early as this week. 
""We've finalized the appropriations. We’re just going over some of the final text that went back and forth last night,"" Mnuchin told reporters. 
Mnuchin said that if officials can't get everything done at once, some items should be prioritized, including an extension of unemployment insurance, aid to schools and liability protections for businesses reopening.
Instead of continuing a weekly $600 enhancement of unemployment benefits that expires on July 31, Mnuchin said Republicans were looking at replacing 70% of wages. ""We're not going to pay people more to stay home than to work,"" he said.
However, the idea of doing a partial instead of a comprehensive coronavirus aid bill was shot down by Democrats from both sides of the Capitol.
""We cannot piecemeal this,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at a news conference.
Democrats want to keep the enhanced unemployment benefits, and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer scoffed at the divisions that have thus far prevented Republicans from presenting a united proposal.
""Republicans are fighting with themselves over how much to cut unemployment benefits,"" he said.
The draft Senate Republican plan was expected to include direct payments to Americans totaling $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for couples, according to a senior Senate aide. 
Asked whether a payroll tax cut would be included in the proposal being put forth by Senate Republicans, Mnuchin said: ""Not in this, but we're going to come back. ... One of the problems with the payroll tax cut is it takes time, so we are much more focused right now on the direct payments.""

Mnuchin told reporters the proposal being worked out by Senate Republicans will include $16 billion in new funding for coronavirus testing, for a total of $25 billion. He also said this might not be the last coronavirus aid package.

Judy Shelton, who is President Donald Trump’s contentious pick for a place on the board, together with fellow Fed nominee Christopher Waller, the director of research at the St. Louis Fed, this week cleared a key hurdle to confirmation by winning the approval of a majority on the Senate Banking Committee.
They “will have a voice, but they will not actually set the path for monetary policy or regulatory policy -- that will be set by Jay Powell and Randy Quarles,” Dudley said Thursday in an interview on Bloomberg Television and Radio with Tom Keene, Jonathan Ferro (NYSE:FOE) and Lisa Abramowicz, referring to the Fed chair and one of two vice chairs.
Shelton is a strict inflation hawk who long favored returning the U.S. to the gold standard and has questioned the need for a central-bank-controlled benchmark interest rate.
“Returning to the gold standard would result in a tremendous increase in the volatility in interest rates; when gold prices go up, the Federal Reserve would have to raise rates, when gold prices go down the Federal Reserve would have to lower interest rates regardless of what was happening in the real economy, regardless of what’s happening with inflation regardless of what was happening to the employment rate,” Dudley said. “The gold standard is not a good anchor for U.S. monetary policy.”
Shelton has drawn sharp criticism for her unorthodox views on monetary policy and for her sudden willingness to espouse an approach that hews with the president’s. She could still fall short before the full Senate, where four Republican defections could block her confirmation.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy has started to recover from its coronavirus lockdown but signals about a rise in unemployment are raising doubts about how much momentum is building behind the rebound.
Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane has described the shape of the economy as ""so far, so V"", albeit with big risks ahead.
But many economists say the most recent data represents a release of pent-up demand rather than the beginning of a sustained recovery.
Most economists in a Reuters poll published this week thought the outlook for the British economy had stayed the same or worsened over the past month. [ECILT/GB]
Here are some early indications about Britain's recovery so far.
LAYOFFS RISK
The jobs market offers the greatest cause for concern.
Searches on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for the word ""redundancy"" have jumped, something that turned out to be an accurate predictor of layoffs during the 2008/09 financial crisis, according to Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
The proportion of British manufacturers planning redundancies now exceeds 50%, according to trade body Make UK, double the share of a few months ago.
Britain's statistics office said last week that the number of employees on company payrolls slumped by 649,000 between March and June, but the pace of decline had slowed in recent weeks.

CONSUMER DEMAND BOUNCES BACK...
The strongest evidence for a quick rebound comes from consumers. Gauges of confidence and demand - ranging from surveys of households to credit card spending data - suggest a rebound is underway, helped by savings built up during the lockdown when people were unable to eat out or go on holiday.
Still, a return to normal is a way off. Consumer confidence and official retail sales figures on Friday will give a more complete picture of the recovery in household spending.
Graphic: Some gauges of consumer demand show partial recovery - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/nmopalkdjva/Pasted%20image%201595499913522.png
...BUT FOR HOW LONG?
One of the key questions about the strength of the recovery is how consumer behaviour will have changed in response to the pandemic.
""I would put weight on the logic that suggests that as a behavioural response to the supply shock, cautious consumers, worried about unemployment and health risks, will hold back the economy,"" BoE rate-setter Jonathan Haskel said on Thursday.
He pointed to surveys showing a majority of British people are uncomfortable about eating indoors in restaurants and going to the cinema.

BUSINESSES SEE A LONG HAUL
Many companies fear demand will not recover to normal levels quickly.
Nearly half of large British businesses surveyed by accountants Deloitte said it would take until after the second quarter of next year for demand to return to pre-pandemic levels.
Similarly, a BoE survey of company executives showed businesses still see a 10% hit to sales from the COVID-19 crisis in early 2021 - which will likely take some time to fade.
In May, the BoE published a scenario suggesting the economy would regain its pre-pandemic size by the second half of 2021.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hyperinflation has blighted Zimbabwe, Venezuela and the former Yugoslavia among others over the years.
Now, Lebanon has been gripped by the phenomenon, becoming the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to suffer from rapid, runaway price rises for goods and services.
It joins Venezuela, which has been locked in hyperinflation since April, its second bout in recent years, according to Steve H. Hanke, Professor of Applied Economics at the Johns Hopkins University and an expert on the topic. 
The occurrence happens when a country's inflation rate exceeds 50% per month over a period of time, defined by Hanke as 30 consecutive days. That happened in Lebanon this week.
""Lebanon is the first MENA country in history to experience a hyperinflation,"" said Hanke, who with his colleague Nicholas Krus has traced 61 other episodes of hyperinflation in world history, such as Hungary in 1945 and Yugoslavia between 1992 and 1994 when hyperinflation peaked at 313 million percent per month.

Graphic: Lebanon hit by hyperinflation - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/nmovalkqjpa/eikon.png
""The underlying causes of inflation are always the same,"" said Hanke. ""Governments start running larger and larger fiscal deficits and call on the central bank to fund those deficits because tax and bond financing avenues are inadequate. In hyperinflations, central banks are required to virtually fund the governments entire fiscal operations.""
Entangled in its worst crisis since the 1975-90 civil war, Lebanon's plight has worsened since defaulting on its debt in March after years of financial engineering by the central bank to help fund the government. Food and clothing costs surged 190% and 172% respectively in May from a year earlier, according to official data cited by Credit Libanais.
Modest advances in Venezuela in taming inflation since last year have been wiped out by chronic fuel shortages and a plummeting exchange rate. After peaking in 2018 at 1.8 million percent, according to official data, inflation slowed last year as the government eased economic controls, helping keep monthly consumer price increases below 30% in February and March.

Although the number of emerging and frontier markets currently experiencing severe inflation problems is rather low, it is increasing, said Hanke, adding that the impact of COVID-19 had not worsened inflation in troubled currency countries to any significant degree.
Zimbabwe, Syria, Sudan and Iran are facing surging inflation, but none are currently suffering hyperinflation, said Hanke.
Expectations for long-term inflation for emerging markets rose steeply in the initial onset of the pandemic, particularly for more vulnerable economies. But those expectations have since eased to record lows for many emerging markets.
In a bid to stimulate their economies, many emerging market central banks aggressively eased monetary policy in the wake of the pandemic, moves made possible by their low inflation and huge quantitative easing by developed market central banks.

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 09:36AM ET</span>","EU parliament to push for tweaks in recovery plan, long-term budget","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Parliament will push for more of the EU recovery package to be spent on research and development, health and education and for a clearer link between economic aid and observing the rule of law, deputies said on Thursday.
In their first debate on the agreement struck by EU leaders on a 750 billion euro pandemic stimulus and a common 2021-27 budget of 1.074 trillion euros this week, many members of the EU assembly said they would fight for changes.
The European Parliament has to approve the spending plan over the next several months, before it can become reality and help lift the EU economy from recession.
""I am happy about the agreement but I am not happy about the deal,"" said Manfred Weber, who leads the biggest, centre-right parliamentary group, EPP.
""We think the MFF (the long-term budget) is not giving proper answers to the challenges of the next seven years. It has to be more future oriented,"" he said.
He and leaders of other parliamentary groups said more money was needed to develop a stronger European coastguard, for health protection, research and development as well as defence and development aid for Africa and for other EU neighbours.
MEPs also said money from the recovery package and the budget should be assigned to a larger degree to pan-European projects like creating a trans-national 5G mobile network, European battery production, to become independent of China, or energy production from hydrogen.
Deputies also called for a more clearly formulated link between governments observing the rule of law - the division of power between lawmakers, the executive branch and the judiciary - and the disbursement of European money.
""We have to be clear on this. We need a roadmap for implementing the clear principle: no money without respecting European rules and mechanisms,"" said Weber.

Alex Brazier, the BoE's Executive Director for Financial Stability Strategy and Risk, said many businesses that were borrowing heavily during the crisis would need or want to raise equity finance in future.
Changes to rules which unfairly favoured funds offering immediate redemptions to investors, as well as how insurers could invest, were needed, Brazier said.

""Even investors who should have the longest horizons seem to have a fetish for liquidity and an aversion to really illiquid growth capital assets,"" he said.

“It won’t be in the base bill but as we know, this is CARES 4.0, there could be CARES 5.0,” he said in a CNBC interview Thursday.
Senate Republicans and the Trump administration are struggling to reach a consensus on the contours of another stimulus plan, putting at risk the White House goal of enacting a package by the end of next week.

Speaking to Exame Research in an online event broadcast on Wednesday, Sachsida said all the forecasts for a fall in gross domestic product of 6.5% or more this year will have to be revised, and the downturn will be much closer to the government's projected -4.7%.

“Fiscal and monetary policy in a monetary union” was added to the work streams that outline the scope of the review -- joining topics such as inflation, digitalization and climate change. It comes just days after European Union leaders agreed on a landmark 750 billion euro ($869 billion) stimulus package that includes a plan to offer joint debt.
Just a few months into the process, the ECB decided in April to postpone the review as policy makers focused on trying to contain the economic fallout from the pandemic. New social distancing rules also forced the cancellation of conferences and events with the general public.
President Christine Lagarde and Chief Economist Philip Lane will now hold their first listening event with civil society organizations in a virtual format on Oct. 21, the ECB said Thursday. National central banks plan their events in the final three months of this year or the first quarter of 2021.
While the review was supposed to be concluded by the middle of next year, Lagarde said earlier this month that the second half of 2021 is more likely “because there’s an awful lot of work that needs to be done.”

1688,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 08:11AM ET</span>",Thai coconut milk maker says monkey labour accusation slashed sales,"By Chayut Setboonsarng
SAMUT SONGKRAM, Thailand (Reuters) - Thai coconut milk producer, Theppadungporn Coconut, suffered a sharp drop in sales after an animal rights groups accused the industry of using monkey labour, an executive said, adding it was auditing plantations to show animals were not used.
Several British retailers pulled Thai coconut products from their shelves earlier this month after a report by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) alleged that coconuts in Thailand are picked by abused monkeys.
""We saw sales fall 20 to 30% (from last year) after the news,"" said Aphisak Theppadungporn, managing director of Theppadungporn Coconut Co. Ltd, one of Thailand's biggest producers and exporters which makes Chaokoh coconut milk.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's fiancée Carrie Symonds had welcomed pledges to stop selling coconut products that use monkey labour, and urged others to follow suit. 
PETA has rejected the Thai government's claim that use of monkeys was almost ""non-existent"". Its report said the majority of Thai coconuts were harvested by monkeys caught from the wild. 
Aphisak said evidence and documents were being prepared for customers in its main markets, and for PETA, to show monkeys were not involved in Theppadungporn Coconut products. 
It started auditing plantations in January and of the more than 100 checked by a third party so far, none were found to have used monkeys, Aphisak said.
Coconuts are overwhelmingly collected by humans using poles, Aphisak and the Thai authorities have said.
Thailand last year produced more than 806,000 tonnes of coconut and exported coconut milk worth nearly $400 million, about 8% to Britain.
Wirat Saengjun, owner of a plantation in Samut Songkram close to Bangkok, said he was now selling about half the number of coconuts at half of the price of earlier in the year, forcing him to reduce his workforce.

""Coconut milk is not selling very well. It's probably from the news,"" he said, referring to the PETA report.

""By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement - at this point - unlikely,"" Michel Barnier said. 
He added that as long as London's position on these two core matters does not shift, there was a risk of failure of negotiations and a damaging no-deal split between Britain and the 27-nation bloc at the end of this year.
Speaking after this week's round of negotiations in London, Barnier said there had been no progress at all on the question of ensuring fairness on state aid.
""The time for answers is quickly running out,"" he told a news conference in London, referring to the five months left before the end of Britain's transition period since it formally left the EU at the end of January. 
""If we do not reach an agreement on our future partnership, there will be more friction.""
Barnier noted some progress on lateral issues this week but said the EU would not seal an agreement that would damage its fishing industry and noted that the sides were still ""far away"" from each other with only a few weeks left to go. 
""We will not accept to foot the bill for the UK's political choices,"" he said. 

Speaking separately in London on Thursday, the UK's Brexit negotiator David Frost said he thought sealing a deal was still possible in September.

The measure was initially adopted in April for the period covering the first six months of the year, and has now been extended to Oct. 31. It will also be applied by the United Kingdom.
""Today's decision is due to the risks posed to public health by the number of coronavirus cases in member states and to the shortages of medical equipment which are still recorded,"" the EU executive commission said in a statement released on Thursday.
Masks, testing kits and ventilators are among imported items that will continue to be exempted from sale tax and customs duties in the 27-nation bloc and Britain.

Medical gear was in short supply when the pandemic first hit countries in the bloc in March. The problem is less intense now as most European nations have long past the peak of their outbreaks, but shortages could re-emerge in the event of a second large wave, which is considered possible in the autumn.

It said 51 buildings with about 20.8 million square feet (1.9 million sq m) of office space are in high flood risk areas, assuming that average global temperatures rise 1.5 degree Celsius as a U.N. panel has estimated may happen between 2030 and 2052.
The city-state's Marina Bay area with soaring office towers worth billions of dollars is the most vulnerable, CBRE said. 
Much of Singapore's financial district, where numerous multi-national companies and banks have offices, is built on reclaimed land and is less than 5 metres above sea level. 
Assuming global temperatures rise by 4 degrees Celsius by the year 2100, an additional 4 million square feet of office area across 13 buildings in the CBD may be under threat, CBRE said. 
""Singapore is vulnerable to prolonged heat waves, increased flash floods and rising sea levels as a result of climate change,"" CBRE analysts said in their report. 
""While the government has adopted several pre-emptive policies to mitigate the impact, the measures do not completely eradicate the risks."" 
Protecting Singapore against rising sea levels could cost S$100 billion ($72 billion) or more over 100 years, according to the government. 

In 2019, it said it would spend S$400 million to upgrade and maintain the country's drains and strengthen its flood resilience.

EU leaders agreed on Tuesday after a four-day summit to impose a tax on non-recycled plastic and pass the money on to the EU and to have a tax on digital services and on goods important into the EU from countries with lower CO2 emission standards, among others.
""The big winner of this summit are the new own resources"" von der Leyen said in presenting the summit agreement to parliamentarians, who will have to approve it over the coming months. 
""We have now a unanimous agreement on the need for new own resources. And this is a huge and historic step forward for our union, which both the Commission and the parliament have long been pushing for,"" she said.
Von der Leyen also stressed that the disbursement of cash from the 750 billion euro recovery package to EU countries was linked to governments observing the rule of law.

The link, albeit not clearly formulated in the conclusions of the summit, is a means of pressure on Poland and Hungary to heed EU calls for them not to undermine the independence of the courts, non-governmental organisations and media.

The lower loan rate comes as Beijing encourages lenders to buffer the real economy from the impact from the COVID-19 epidemic.
The bank's outstanding loans to the manufacturing sector totaled 1.85 trillion yuan ($264.54 billion) as of the end of June, up 14% from the beginning of the year, Gu told reporters at a briefing.
Its new loans to small and micro-sized enterprises totaled 168.4 billion yuan in the first half, up 35.7% from a year earlier, Gu said.

The Department of Trade (DTI) document said it was considering banning blacklisting and ordering the removal of any adverse information on consumers' profiles, until Sept. 30 or when a national state of disaster ends, whichever comes first.
""The regulations are aimed at assisting all consumers who are negatively affected by the national state of disaster ... and subsequently have had their credit records deteriorating,"" said the document, published by the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA).
The changes would be backdated to April 1, the document said, giving lenders until July 24 to submit written responses.
""Government will carefully consider any proposals ... and will take all views into account before making a decision,"" the DTI said, adding Trade Minister Ebrahim Patel would not consider the draft document until the consultation was complete.
The DA said the changes would hit banks' lending appetite, pushing up the cost of credit, and allow already indebted South Africans to rack up further borrowings.
Separately, Standard Bank (J:SBKJ) and  Investec  (L:INVP) (J:INLJ) have started offering government-backed coronavirus loans under adjusted terms to allow more firms to access funds, their websites showed, including removing a cap on turnover.
Lenders and the government have been looking to boost take-up of an up to 200 billion rand ($12.17 billion) government scheme to drive lending to coronavirus-hit businesses. Only 10.6 billion rand had been paid out by July 7.
Standard Bank confirmed customers could now access the loans under adjusted terms but had no further comment. Investec and other major banks had no immediate comment.

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>","French economy to rebound to pre-crisis levels by 2022, minister says","PARIS (Reuters) - The French economy is on course to rebound by 8% next year and should return to pre-crisis levels by 2022, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday.
Le Maire told the National Assembly recent economic data had been ""satisfying but too fragile"" for now to change forecasts for an economic contraction this year of 11%, the worst since modern records began.
""I won't resign myself to a -11% recession. If we step up the measures that we have already decided and make sure they are implemented well, we can do better than -11% in 2020,"" Le Maire said to open a debate on the public finances.
The government has committed more than 460 billion euros ($533 billion) in public funds to supporting the economy. Most will come in the form of state-guaranteed loans and tax breaks to help companies cope with a slump in business.
Le Maire is drafting a recovery plan worth more than 100 billion euros to be presented on Aug. 24, aimed at bringing the euro zone's second-biggest economy back to pre-crisis levels.
Le Maire said that while he forecast a rebound in growth of 8% next year, the outlook was particularly difficult to project and depended in part on the depth of the recession this year.
""My objective is that we are able from 2022 to return to a level of growth and national wealth comparable to that before the crisis,"" Le Maire told lawmakers.
The government put France under one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe in mid-March, shutting down vast swathes of the economy.
Activity has steadily picked up since lockdown restrictions began to be lifted on May 11, although businesses such as hotels relying on foreign tourists continue to suffer.

The INSEE official statistics agency said on Thursday business confidence gained further ground in July, though it remains far from pre-crisis levels.
