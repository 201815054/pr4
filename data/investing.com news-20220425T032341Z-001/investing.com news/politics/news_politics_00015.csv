Pentagon spokesman Admiral John Kirby said it would be up to the Army to decide on the timing of the release of details of the investigation and any steps to be taken. 
""It is an Army investigation, and it is Army's decision to determine what, if anything, they will do,"" Kirby told a regular news briefing. 
Bergdahl was released in May in a prisoner swap after five years in captivity. 
Some of his fellow soldiers in Afghanistan have said that Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban after he deserted his post. 
The administration of President Barack Obama was initially praised for securing his release, but there was a backlash from critics on Capitol Hill who charged that the White House had failed to give Congress adequate notice before freeing prisoners from at the U.S. military's detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
The Pentagon appointed Major General Kenneth Dahl to investigate the case, to determine whether Bergdahl had broken military rules and to recommend any appropriate punishment. 

In November, the Pentagon said That Dahl had submitted an initial report to the military chain of command for review. It also rejected news reports suggesting that results of the investigation were being delayed until after the November mid-term elections.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two environmental groups have sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for what the groups said was failing to comply with a court order requiring the agency to strengthen regulations preventing pollution from stormwater runoff. 
The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the Environmental Defense Center (EDC) said in a statement that they filed the suit on Thursday in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. 
The groups said EPA has not obeyed a 2003 ruling from the 9th circuit in EDC v. EPA that required the agency to redo portions of its 1999 stormwater regulations dealing with urban runoff because they were not in line with the Clean Water Act. 
The order also directed the agency to consider regulating runoff from unpaved forest roads. 
NRDC and EDC said they have asked the court to impose a deadline for the EPA to act in these matters. 
In response to the lawsuit, EPA said it was working to strengthen its existing stormwater pollution program by requiring more environmental protections when renewing storm sewer permits and working with states and municipalities to reduce water pollution. 
""The agency's goal is to build a broad nationwide constituency for better stormwater pollution control by educating communities and giving them an opportunity to develop strong programs before creating additional federal regulatory requirements,"" EPA said in a statement. 
Rain water that runs off roads and other hard surfaces into sewer systems can contaminate water supplies, cause beach closings and harm aquatic life. 
The environmental groups said EPA pledged it would revamp its urban stormwater rules in 2009, but backed off from those plans. 
The agency has also said it would weigh whether to issue standards for forest road runoff, but no timeline has been set for a decision. 

""We hope this suit spurs EPA to get back into the business of modernizing its whole stormwater program, which badly needs updating and could greatly benefit from new green technologies,"" said NRDC senior attorney Larry Levine in a statement.

3,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2014 07:21AM ET</span>",Guardian of New Hampshire's presidential primary ready for another round,"By Scott Malone 
CONCORD, N.H. (Reuters) - As New Hampshire braces for another wave of White House hopefuls next year seeking votes in the first-in-the-nation nominating primary, much of the credit for the state's hold on that position goes to one man: Secretary of State William Gardner. 
For the past four decades, Gardner has outmaneuvered states including Florida and Nevada to protect the front-runner spot mandated by New Hampshire law - and it has not always been easy. The state has steadily moved forward its primary, originally held in March. It shoe-horned the past two contests into January. 
Ask Gardner when the 2016 primary, which marks the 100th anniversary of the event, will be held and he smiles, careful not to limit his options. 
""I have never set the date and then changed it,"" said Gardner, 66. ""I wait until I feel it's safe to do it and then I do it."" 
But the early January primaries of 2008 and 2012 were unpopular with Democratic and Republican officials, who worried that Americans were paying more attention to holiday parties than to candidates barnstorming New Hampshire and Iowa, whose citizens kick off nominating season with caucuses. 
This time around, observers said, it is unlikely that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or former Florida Governor Jeb Bush will be showing up at diners in Manchester or town meetings in the White Mountains between Christmas and New Year's next year. 
""I suspect that this time will be different, that we won't have the creep that we've had,"" said Neil Levesque, executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics. 
The Republican National Committee has established rules penalizing states that hold votes ahead of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada, he noted. 
RETAIL POLITICS 
Regardless of when the primary is held, White House hopefuls already are making the rounds in New Hampshire, where voters expect to speak to candidates in person before they vote. 
Most make multiple visits to the state before arriving at Gardner's state house office, where candidates from former President George W. Bush to Clinton have sat down at a wooden desk and filled out the paperwork to get on New Hampshire's primary ballot. 
Several voters said they were looking forward to the flood of candidates. 
""I enjoy it and you get to know much more about them than you would just watching TV and reading the papers,"" Nancy LeBlanc, a 77-year-old retiree, said over breakfast at Chez Vachon, a Manchester diner popular with barnstorming candidates. 
The state's political leaders contend that voters like LeBlanc play a valuable role in the U.S. political process by allowing little-known names to gain momentum. 
In recent decades, Republican Arizona Senator John McCain, and Democratic former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter both used strong showings in New Hampshire to snag their parties' nominations after lackluster early starts. 
The primary is all the more valuable as television ads play an ever-greater role in later stages of campaigns. 
""A candidate that comes in with $20 million in the bank already has a lead on one who does not,"" said Jennifer Horn, chairman of the state's Republican Party. ""A state like New Hampshire allows those other candidates a fair chance."" 
Outside the state, some see New Hampshire's position as little more than a quirk of history and doubt that its voters are more astute than those in any other state. 
""Why should it always be Iowa and New Hampshire? There are plenty of states with two or three electoral votes that could kick off the process,"" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. 
""But it's not going to change,"" he said. 
Regardless of how unique New Hampshire's voters are, observers agreed that Gardner, who has held his position since 1976, has stood out for his ability to uphold the New Hampshire law that requires its primary to be the first by at least a week. 
""There is no such thing as pressuring Bill Gardner and woe to the person who tries,"" said Ray Buckley, chairman of the state's Democratic Party. ""Bill is going to do what he thinks is best for the primary and that's it."" 
Gardner, who served briefly in the state legislature before taking on his current role, said he has no intention of allowing New Hampshire's position to slip. 

""As long as the people of the state have the will to keep this, they will keep this,"" Gardner said. ""There are not a whole lot of political traditions in this country that are lasting. This is one.""

4,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2014 07:20AM ET</span>","In North Dakota, countdown looms for $5.3 billion oil tax break","By Ernest Scheyder 
BISMARCK, N.D. (Reuters) - Tumbling U.S. oil markets hit an important if obscure milestone on Thursday, closing for the first time at a price that could trigger a $5.3 billion, two-year tax break for North Dakota oil drillers as soon as next summer. 
Under a decades-old law, the state at the heart of the U.S. shale oil boom would waive its 6.5 percent oil extraction tax once the average monthly price of benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude at Cushing, Oklahoma, falls below a certain threshold for five consecutive months. 
For next year, that price is $55.08 per barrel. On Thursday, U.S. crude oil futures settled at $54.11 per barrel, the lowest close since May 2009 and the latest leg of a rout that has halved the price of crude since June. 
It is unlikely that the clock would start ticking in December, since the average price is still above $61 a barrel. But if prices remain this low into next year, it could be a reality as soon as next June. 
""We're really at the point where we could start calculating this,"" Ryan Rauschenberger, North Dakota's tax commissioner, said in an interview. 
The hope of a future tax break will be cold comfort for North Dakota's beleaguered oil producers, including Continental Resources Inc and Oasis Petroleum Inc, which plan to spend less money in 2015. 
The tax break ""would be an important incentive for the industry to continue investing,"" said Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, an industry trade group. 
The potential tax relief could make it difficult to know how much crashing oil prices are hurting the nation's oil producers. It also would muddy the waters to determine how quickly a slowdown in U.S. production affects a growing global supply glut. 
While only about 3 percent of oil taxes go to fund the state's day-to-day operations, a reduction would wreak havoc with parts of the state's budget and crimp funding for new schools, water pipelines and other major projects in western oil-producing counties that have made North Dakota the second-largest U.S. oil producer. 
Rauschenberger estimates that North Dakota would only take in $2.9 billion in oil taxes in the next two years without the oil extraction tax. With the tax, the projection is $8.2 billion. 
SEEN IT BEFORE 
The tax break was instituted in 1987, several years after North Dakota's second oil boom went bust. Oil prices had collapsed after Saudi Arabia flooded the market in a price war with other producers - a scenario some see repeating now. 
The break was designed ""to try and keep oil production occurring in the state in a low-price environment,"" said Rauschenberger, who was appointed tax commissioner last year and elected to a four-year term last month. 
From 1987 until 2004, the trigger was in effect, meaning oil extraction tax collections were a pittance compared with, say, this past July, when $325 million in oil taxes rolled into state coffers, the highest monthly amount in history. 
Here is how it works. 
If the average price of crude is below an inflation-adjusted limit - set at $55.08 per barrel for 2015 - for five consecutive months, then the 6.5 percent oil extraction tax is waived for the first 24 months of a well's life. 
After that 24 months is up, and if the average price of oil is still below $55.08 per barrel, the tax rate rises to 4 percent, not the original 6.5 percent. 
The full 6.5 percent oil extraction tax only returns if the average price of oil rises above that $55.08 per barrel threshold each month for a five-month period. The break does not apply to wells already in production, however. 
The state still imposes a separate 5 percent gross production tax as a type of property tax on each barrel, no matter what. 

But a complete repeal of the 6.5 percent extraction tax would mean North Dakota's ""overall oil tax rate would be effectively cut in half,"" Rauschenberger said.

5,By International Business Times,"<span>Dec 19, 2014 01:15AM ET</span>",Obama Mulls 'Proportional' Response To Sony Hack,"By Thomas Halleck -

The White House is not sure how it will respond if it determines that the North Korean government sponsored the recent cyberattack against the Sony Corporation’s U.S. film division, as it looks for a way to respond that is forceful enough without stirring up more trouble. The U.S. has not yet concluded an official investigation but has some evidence that Pyongyang was behind the hack.
The White House is looking at a “range of options” for a “proportional response,” spokesman Josh Earnest said at a press conference Thursday evening. President Barack Obama’s senior advisers were meeting daily over the Sony hack, he said, adding that the government was not prepared to announce that any country was behind it.
North Korea claims that it was not behind the attack, but investigators say that the malware on Sony’s system tried to connect to a network in North Korea, in addition to several other countries, the White House says. The North Korean government strictly controls the limited Internet access inside its borders, so investigators reportedly view the attempt as potential evidence that the devastating attack was sponsored by Kim Jong-un’s regime.
Obama must deter North Korea from conducting similar attacks in the future, as well as countries like Russia and China, who are considered much greater threats to national cybersecurity. If Washington retaliates with a counter-attack, it could make it harder for U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on North Korea, former intelligence officers told the Wall Street Journal. The New York Times reported earlier this year that White House officials were “squeamish” about launching cyber-attacks against foreign nation, over fears of escalation.
North Korea’s Internet connections run through China, but since the U.S. is already facing off with Beijing over hacking accusations, the country is unlikely to step in. Investigators reportedly suspect that the North Korean hacking unit of its General Reconnaissance Bureau was behind the Sony hack.
Sony announced Thursday that it was cancelling the release of “The Interview” due to terror threats, and after a number of major theater chains said they would not screen the film.
North Korea is an isolated nation, so there is little pressure the U.S. can apply economically, the report said. Some officials say Obama should issue a statement that the Sony hack crossed a line. That tactic has only led to mutual accusations between the U.S. and China that some security companies are calling a “cyber cold war.”"
6,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2014 12:10AM ET</span>",Louisville lawmakers approve minimum wage hike,"By Steve Bittenbender 
LOUISVILLE, Ky (Reuters) - Louisville, Kentucky officials on Thursday approved an increase to the city's minimum wage, boosting it from the federal rate of $7.25 to $9 an hour by 2017, becoming the 12th city to approve a hike this year. 
The increase, which came after a series of contentious debates in the weeks leading up to and even during Thursday's Louisville Metro Council meeting, came down to a party-line vote. All 16 Democrats in attendance supported the measure, while all nine Republicans voted against it. 
Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer had said earlier he would veto the council's original proposal, which would have raised pay to $10.10 an hour over a three-year period. However, Fischer said in a statement released after the vote he was pleased with the amended ordinance. 
After 2017, the wage will be adjusted according to the Consumer Price Index. 
With the vote, Louisville became the 12th U.S. city to increase the minimum wage this year, and the first city in southern states to do so, according to Paul Sonn, general counsel with the National Employment Law Project. 
Earlier this month, the Chicago City Council voted to increase the wage to $13 an hour by 2019. On Election Day, voters in Arkansas backed an initiative to increase the state's minimum wage to $8.50 by 2016, and Nebraska voters passed a referendum to make it $9 by 2016. 
Other states, including Florida, Missouri and Ohio, base their minimum wages on consumer price or cost of living indices. 
Democratic Louisville Councilman David Yates said local leaders routinely approve incentives for companies to locate and expand in the city. ""This is the first time we've done something for the workers,"" he said. 
Both Republicans and Democrats agree the increase will face a challenge in the courts, with detractors arguing that the local council does not have the authority to raise the wage. 
Opponents said companies with lower-paying jobs will seek to move elsewhere in the Louisville region to take advantage of the city's benefits while not having to pay the higher wages. 
""If we're going to have Louisville compete, we have to compete on a level playing field,"" Republican Councilman Kevin Kramer said.

7,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2014 12:10AM ET</span>",White House releases snapshot of plan to rate U.S. colleges,"By Elvina Nawaguna 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Friday released a draft of its plan to rate U.S. colleges and tie federal aid to performance as a way to coax institutions to pull up their socks. 
The U.S. Education Department will rate institutions on their performance, intake of low-income students, completion rates, affordability, employment prospects and student loan repayment rates. 
""Relatively simple metrics like the percentage of students repaying their loans on time might be important as consumers weigh whether or not they will be able to handle their financial obligations after attending a specific school,"" the Education Department said in the document released Friday.  
President Barack Obama in 2013 announced the move to start rating colleges as part of a plan to curb the growing cost of higher education and runaway student loan debt and to improve job prospects for college students. 
The college rating system would classify colleges as high-, low- or middle-perfoming. 
Congressional Republicans and education trade groups opposed to the plan say it is a form of government overreach that would hurt colleges serving low-income students. 
""If after nearly a year and half of work, this is all the Department can muster, it seems to support the long held belief by many in higher education that while a college rating system is admirable in theory, it is not feasible to create metrics that definitively assess the quality of so many institutions across the country,"" Steve Gunderson, president and chief executive of the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, said in a statement. 
The federal government provides more than $150 billion in student aid annually. 
Supporters of a ratings system would hold institutions accountable and help prospective students weigh the pros and cons of choosing a particular college. 
""Right now, prospective students and their families lack access to comprehensive and useable information for one of the biggest financial investments they'll ever make. Taxpayers should not write a blank check to schools that fail to serve students,"" Jennifer Wang, policy director at Young Invincibles an organization focused on issues affecting 18 to 34-year-olds. 

The Education Department is seeking public comments on the plan and expects to have a final rating system by the 2015-2016 academic year.

8,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2014 09:20PM ET</span>",Washington governor pushes capital gains tax in face of budget gap,"By Eric M. Johnson 
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Washington state Governor Jay Inslee on Thursday proposed a new tax on capital gains to try to close a projected budget shortfall of more than $2 billion, rolling back on a no-new-taxes campaign pledge. 
The proposal, which Inslee said would provide much-needed funds for schools and other programs, is included in a $39 billion 2015-2017 budget he unveiled in Olympia, where he told reporters the tax would raise nearly $800 million. 
""We simply have not been able to generate the revenue necessary,"" Inslee said, citing slower-than-desired economic growth and a failure by lawmakers to close tax loopholes. ""This is a fair way to raise needed revenue."" 
The levy appears to go against Inslee's 2012 campaign pledge to veto new tax proposals. 
Inslee's budget is likely to usher in a protracted fight when the state legislature reconvenes in January, with competing proposals expected out of the Republican-controlled Senate and from Democrats who have a majority in the House. 
""Investing in student achievement and providing essential services should not depend on risky tax schemes that threaten our economy,"" said Republican state Senator Andy Hill. 
Washington has been one of nine U.S. states that do not tax capital gains from the sale of stocks, bonds, and other assets, Inslee said, and the proposed levies are lower than those in Idaho, Oregon and California. 
Washington state in 2016 would apply a 7 percent tax to capital gains above $25,000 for individuals and $50,000 for couples, which would affect less than 1 percent of the state's taxpayers, with exemptions for retirement accounts, homes, farms and forestry, he said. 
Inslee's budget calls for a $5 billion spending increase over the 2013-2015 period, largely going to his $2.3 billion education plan aimed at bringing the state in line with court-ordered increases in K-12 schools funding. 
The state Supreme Court in September found the legislature in contempt for failing to uphold a court order to come up with a plan to infuse billions of dollars into public education. 
Overall, Inslee's budget would raise about $1.4 billion in new revenues through taxes, including raising the cigarette tax by 50 cents per pack, closing loopholes, and other sources. It still leaves the state roughly $2.4 billion short. 

On Wednesday, Inslee laid out a carbon cap-and-trade program in 2016 aimed at raising $1 billion per year, with some $380 million earmarked for education.

9,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2014 09:20PM ET</span>","With Cuba decision, Obama hands Hillary Clinton a gift","By Steve Holland 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton knows a political gift when she sees one. 
She was quick to embrace the step this week when President Barack Obama, a fellow Democrat no longer having to face an electorate, relaxed U.S. policy toward Cuba. 
While assailed by Republicans opposed to restoring ties with the communist-led island, the action has the power to solidify support for Democrats among increasingly influential Latino voters and appeal to voters in farm states like Iowa eager to do business in Havana. 
Obama's unilateral move has gently shaken up the 2016 race to succeed him, exposing divisions among Republicans and possibly helping Democrats already buoyed by his decision to liberalize immigration policy. 
Potential contenders Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio adhered to the traditional Republican hard line on Cuba and sharply criticized Obama. But Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, who has a libertarian streak, backed the new policy. 
A likely White House candidate, Paul told a West Virginia radio station that the 50-year-old embargo with Cuba ""just hasn't worked."" 
Clinton, Obama's former secretary of state, also had asserted the previous policy was not working. In her memoir, ""Hard Choices,"" she wrote that she urged Obama to shift. She welcomed the change in a statement on Wednesday. 
Democrats argue that Clinton's embrace of Obama on Cuba could help her with Latino voters, especially younger ones in the key state of Florida, who are less inclined than their elders to be virulently opposed to the Cuban government. 
Of America's 1.5-million-strong Cuban-American population, about 80 percent live in Florida. 
""I think it'll help her with the younger folks,"" Democratic strategist Bud Jackson said of Clinton. 
Latinos already like what they see in Clinton. 
A Telemundo/NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found on Thursday that 61 percent of Latinos see themselves supporting Clinton in 2016, 11 points more than the general population. 
MORE OF A PLUS 
The Cuba shift could also prove popular among those dependent on America's agricultural businesses, major hotels and even sports fans who enjoy watching the best Cuban players make it to Major League Baseball. 
""The political calculation has to be that this is more of a plus for a candidate for president than a minus,"" said David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University. 
A Reuters/Ipsos poll of more than 31,000 adults between July and October showed Americans largely open to forging diplomatic relations with Cuba. About one-fifth opposed such a move, while 43 percent backed it and around 37 percent were unsure. 
But there are potential pitfalls for Clinton. She will need to stake out some positions of her own or risk criticism that she simply represents the third term of a president who is saddled with a 40 percent approval rating. 
In their 2008 battle for the Democratic presidential nomination that Obama won, Clinton accused him of being ""naive"" for offering to meet leaders of such renegade nations as Cuba without conditions. 
Since flirting with a presidential race, Clinton for the most part has chosen not to separate herself from Obama other than to question his decision not to arm Syrian rebels, as her memoir reveals. 
Lanhee Chen, a Hoover Institution scholar who advised Republican Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential bid, said if Clinton is ""trying to draw some distance from the president's foreign policy in some ways, it was not useful to have something where she's perfectly aligned with him."" 
There are also risks for Jeb Bush, a former Florida governor, and Rubio, a Florida senator. In their criticisms of Obama's policy, the two Republicans are aligning themselves with their party's conservative base but their views could appear outdated to moderate voters. 

""I think it's kind of a blind cul-de-sac for people like Rubio and Bush to get pushed into,"" said Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, who was Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry's campaign manager in 2004. ""It reflects a Florida that doesn't exist anymore.""

10,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2014 08:20PM ET</span>",Not known yet if Cuba deal might bring some U.S. fugitives home,"By Mark Guarino 
CHICAGO (Reuters) - When he heard that United States and Cuba plan to restore diplomatic ties, retired New York City police detective Tom Nerney says he was struck with hope that a convicted killer he helped bring to justice but who escaped to the Caribbean island would finally be brought home after more than 30 years. 
""It's a ray of sunshine for us,"" he told Reuters. 
Nerney and other law enforcement officials say they want the Obama administration to push Cuba to extradite the nearly 80 fugitives from the U.S. justice system who the FBI says have sought and found asylum there. 
""It's a haven for fugitives,"" Nerney says of Cuba. ""Hopefully [the U.S. State Department] will work something out so we can get these fugitives back."" 
Cuba has regularly returned U.S. fugitives since 2006, but U.S. authorities say dozens remain. 
In a major policy shift, President Barack Obama announced on Wednesday that the United States is renewing the diplomatic ties it severed with communist-ruled Cuba in 1961. 
He also eased restrictions on some commerce and travel, and said he had instructed the State Department to review Cuba's current designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. The designation is in place in part because Washington says Cuba harbors fugitives wanted by the United States. 
The State Department has not said if it will make a priority of seeking extraditions of fugitives. 
The most prominent case is Joanne Chesimard who was discovered to be living in Cuba in 1984 after escaping a New Jersey state prison following her life sentence conviction for killing a New Jersey State trooper in 1973. She has since changed her name to Assata Shakur and has become an author and radical activist. 
Last year Chesimard became the first woman on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists list, with a $1 million reward posted for her capture. Newark FBI Special Agent in Charge Aaron Ford said on Wednesday there was an active arrest warrant for Chesimard and his field office was actively working the case with law enforcement partners. 
""The FBI will continue to pursue justice, regardless of how long it takes, and are hopeful any changes in relations between the United States and Cuba will assist us with her apprehension and return,"" he said. 
In 2005, then President Fidel Castro said of the U.S. authorities' portrayal of Chesimard, ""They wanted to portray her as a terrorist, something that was an injustice, a brutality, an infamous lie."" 
In the two countries' long hostile relations, Cuba has charged in the past that the United States turns a blind eye to people Havana views as terrorists, in particular Cuban exiles suspected of involvement in attacks on Cuba. 
Like Chesimard, many of the best-known fugitives known to be in Cuba have been there for several decades, have established new families and made it clear through media interviews they don't expect to return home. 
They include Charlie Hill, an Illinois native who is wanted by New Mexico authorities for allegedly killing a state trooper and hijacking a plane in 1971. Hill escaped to Cuba with two co-defendants who have since died. 
Some lawmakers worry that many of the fugitives are aging fast, and that the window to get them back to the United States is now. In reference to the Chesimard case, U.S. Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey said in a statement Wednesday that Cuba is harboring a killer. 
Legal experts say extradition is a diplomatic not legal issue. 
""Whoever has possession of the individual has control,"" says Barry Slotnick, a New York criminal defense attorney. ""It's up to the Castro brothers,"" he said, referring to President Raul Castro and his older brother, Fidel Castro, who handed over the presidency in 2008.

11,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2014 06:40PM ET</span>",U.S. Republicans look for ways to block normal ties with Cuba,"By Roberta Rampton and Patricia Zengerle 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in Congress searched on Thursday for a strategy to sink or at least slow President Barack Obama's plan to normalize U.S. relations with Cuba, drawing a shrug from the White House. 
They floated ideas to fight the Democrat Obama's moves to forge ties and expand commercial ties with the communist-led island after half a century of hostility. Their ideas included denying funds to reopen a Havana embassy and blocking the confirmation of a U.S. ambassador. 
""We're going to look at all our options,"" Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Cuban-American who has led the charge against the thaw in relations, said at a Miami news conference without providing specifics. 
Many legal experts, and the White House, say Obama has broad executive powers to ease restrictions on commerce, transportation and banking, even if Congress objects. 
""The steps that the president announced are steps that are well within his executive authority as president of the United States,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters, adding he was ""not particularly"" worried about Republican opposition. 
Earnest also said the White House would be willing to consider a possible precedent-shattering visit by Cuban President Raul Castro. On Wednesday, Earnest said Obama was open to a visit to Havana. 
Fidel Castro, Raul's brother, was the last Cuban leader to visit the United States. He spoke to the Council on Foreign Relations in 1959 and in later years addressed the United Nations. 
Mid-level U.S. diplomats visited Havana on occasion over the years while the countries cooperated on immigration, drug interdiction and oil-spill mitigation. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter visited Havana in 2002 and 2011, long after he left office. 
NO TIE TO HUMAN RIGHTS 
Earnest and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Roberta Jacobson, who is expected to visit Cuba in January, said renewed relations were not directly tied to progress on human rights in Cuba. 
""The president has had the leaders of both Burma and China to the United States,"" Earnest said. By meeting such leaders, the United States can better influence countries to respect universal human rights, he said. 
Legal experts say Congress could not block the opening of a U.S. Embassy, since the U.S. Constitution gives the president – not the legislature – authority over diplomatic relations. 
The United States has an Interests Section in the old U.S. Embassy building in Havana, and it would take little to adapt it. The Senate has left many other U.S. missions without ambassadors around the globe this year, as Republicans held up Obama's nominations. 
Other options include writing funding restrictions into a budget bill or trying to pass standalone legislation seeking to preserve Cuba's isolation, such as a bill imposing more sanctions. Obama would almost certainly veto such legislation. 
The biggest obstacle to normal ties with Cuba is a decades-old embargo. With Republicans due to take control of both houses of Congress in January, chances are slim of lawmakers scrapping all sanctions on Cuba soon. 
Those sanctions are enshrined in law, most notably the Helms-Burton act passed in 1996. 
Obama has called on Congress to repeal that law, although Republican leaders have said they will not allow any legislation to move in the House of Representatives that would ease the embargo. 

Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell, who will be the Senate Majority Leader in the new Congress, has yet to comment on the restoration of Cuban-American ties.

12,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2014 05:49PM ET</span>",Obama to set up panel to boost trust between police and communities,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Thursday will set up a task force to draw up recommendations to strengthen trust between law enforcement and local communities, following protests over several instances of police killings of unarmed people this year. 
""There is a sense of urgency,"" White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett told reporters before Obama was to sign an executive order setting up the Task Force on 21st Century Policing. 
She said the order directs the 11-member panel to submit recommendations to the president by March 2. 
Obama had said on Dec. 1 that he would use his last two years in office to address the ""simmering distrust"" between police and minority communities, after days of protests following a grand jury decision not to indict white police officer Darren Wilson in the August shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. 
Days after the Missouri decision, a New York grand jury decided not to bring criminal charges against a white police officer whose choke hold contributed to the death of Eric Garner, a 43-year-old African American, in New York in July. 
""The Task Force will examine ... how to strengthen public trust and foster strong relationships between local law enforcement and the communities that they protect, while also promoting effective crime reduction,"" the White House said in a statement. 
Jarrett said one of the issues to be considered by the panel is formulating best practices for the use of body cameras by police forces. 
Obama has asked the U.S. Congress for $263 million to pay for body cameras for police officers and expand training for law enforcement. 

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey and Laurie Robinson, a George Mason University professor who is a former U.S. assistant attorney general, will lead the task force.

Congress had approved the measure last week and sent it to him for his signature. 
The measure would deny visas and freeze assets of officials involved in what the law considers a crackdown on political opponents during three months of street protests in Venezuela over crime and the economy. 
Those protests sparked violence that killed 43 people, including demonstrators, government supporters and security officials. 
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro accused Obama of hypocrisy for enabling the sanctions a day after announcing an effort to normalize relations with Communist-run Cuba, which has been under U.S. trade sanctions for decades. 
""These are the contradictions of an empire that seeks to impose its domination by whatever means, underestimating the power and conscience of our fatherland,"" Maduro said via his Twitter account. 
U.S. officials say there is still no final list of Venezuelan officials who will be targeted. 
Diplomats in Caracas said it could run into the dozens, involving mainly security officials involved in putting down the protests earlier this year, adding they did not expect the names to be published. 
""These sanctions are not against the Venezuelan people, or against the Venezuelan government as a whole but against individuals accused of violations,"" said one U.S. embassy official who asked not to be identified.

14,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2014 05:30PM ET</span>","U.S. banks to move cautiously into Cuba, trade groups say","By Emily Stephenson and Brett Wolf 
(Reuters) - U.S. banks will be able to do more business in Cuba after the United States and the island nation agreed to restore diplomatic ties, but trade groups said their members will be slow to ramp up operations, fearing big penalties for mistakes. 
Under a series of policy changes announced on Wednesday, U.S. banks will find it easier to process money transfers to and from Cuban banks, and U.S. travelers can use their home credit and debit cards in the island nation. 
The U.S. Treasury Department said it expects to ease its sanction rules for banking in Cuba in the coming weeks. 
But figuring out how to implement those regulations may not be worthwhile for banks, because penalties for breaking sanctions rules can be severe, and Cuba's economy is relatively small, banking trade group officials said. 
Rob Rowe, a lawyer with the American Bankers Association, said in an email that sanctions had been eased in the past without much change in banks' activities. 
""I know that when restrictions were lifted on Myanmar/Burma, many banks decided that the rules were so complex and the penalties...were so significant that it didn't make sense to go all out with business to that country,"" Rowe said. 
Officials stopped short of saying banks would ignore Cuba. 
JPMorgan Chase & Co said in a statement it was waiting for further details on how the rules would be implemented. Banks have been asking questions about how rules might work, said David Schwartz, chief executive of the Florida International Bankers Association. 
But regulators have gone hard after banks for sanctions violations in recent years. BNP Paribas earlier this year agreed to pay nearly $9 billion for breaking embargoes, including against Cuba. 
Given the potential penalties, ""a year from now, I wouldn't expect to see a lot of movement,"" said Schwartz. 
U.S. President Barack Obama said on Wednesday that he was re-establishing relations with Cuba because years of policies designed to isolate Cuba have failed to achieve change on the island.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Secret Service needs an outsider to overhaul the insular agency, beef up staffing and improve training - after building a higher fence around the White House, an independent review concluded on Thursday. 
An executive summary of the highly classified review revealed deep problems at the top of the Secret Service, which is charged with guarding the U.S. president and other senior government officials. 
""The panel heard one common critique from those inside and outside the Service: The Service is too insular,"" the published summary said. 
Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson appointed a four-member independent panel in October after a Sept. 19 intrusion by an Iraq war veteran who scaled the White House fence, sprinted across the lawn and got deep inside the mansion before an off-duty agent stopped him. 
That incident prompted the panel's first recommendation: build a better fence ""as soon as possible."" It recommended one that is at least 4 or 5 feet (120 or 150 cm) higher and curves outward at the top to give agents more time to assess the risk of a jumper. 
But the agency's problems, it noted, ""go deeper than a new fence can fix."" 
A director not tied to agency traditions and personal relationships will be better equipped to do an honest reassessment and encourage a culture of accountability. 
The last Secret Service director, Julia Pierson, was a 30-year veteran who was tasked with cleaning up the agency's culture after a 2012 presidential trip to Colombia in which up to a dozen agents were found to have hired prostitutes. 
Pierson resigned under fierce criticism on Oct. 1, less than two weeks after the Sept. 19 White House intrusion. That fence jumper breach came a day after the disclosure that an armed private security contractor rode on an elevator with Obama in Atlanta in a breach of protocol earlier in September. 
The security lapses, along with a 2011 incident in which seven gunshots were fired at the White House, had raised concerns across Washington that Obama was not as well protected as he should be in an age of global tumult. 
The panel said special agents and uniformed division personnel work an ""unsustainable number of hours."" 
""The Secret Service is stretched to and, in many cases, beyond its limits,"" the panel said. It recommended adding at least 85 special agents and 200 uniformed officers so the agency can shorten long shifts, reduce overtime and free up agents for regular training. 
The agency's training regimen is far below acceptable levels, it said, with the average special agent receiving only 42 hours of training. 
""The panel's recommendations are astute, thorough and fair,"" Johnson said in a statement. 
Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, incoming chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on Thursday promised an independent congressional review of the agency. 

The panel acknowledged that many of its recommendations had been made before but never implemented.

(Reuters) - A hotel tycoon and former Hillary Clinton fundraiser avoided prison on Thursday for conspiring to make $188,000 in illegal U.S. campaign contributions using straw donors. 
Sant Singh Chatwal, chairman of Hampshire Hotels Management, pleaded guilty last April to violating the Federal Election Campaign Act and witness tampering. 
On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Leo Glasser of Brooklyn, New York handed Chatwal a $500,000 fine and three years probation. 
The sentence was considerably less harsh than the 57 to 71 months in prison he faced under federal sentencing guidelines, according to court papers. As part of the plea agreement, Chatwal, 70, also agreed to forfeit $1 million. 
A spokesman for Chatwal on Thursday said the businessman ""deeply regrets his actions and accepts full responsibility."" 
Chatwal has been a major fundraiser for Democrats including former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is considering a run for president in 2016. 
Clinton was not implicated in the scheme. 
Prosecutors said Chatwal from 2007 to 2011 conspired to recruit straw donors -- whom he would reimburse -- to make contributions to candidates for federal office. The scheme violated limits on campaign donations by individuals, prosecutors alleged. 
A straw donor is someone who illegally uses someone else's money to make campaign contributions in his or her own name. 
The illegal contributions were made to three candidates whose identities were not disclosed. 
However, in court papers asking for leniency, Chatwal said that the ""majority of contributions (Chatwal) illegally reimbursed"" were for Hillary Clinton or her political action committee. 
Hampshire, a privately held New York-based company, was founded in 1986 and operates hotels around the world. Chatwal is also the founder of the Bombay Palace restaurant chain. 
The case is U.S. v. Chatwal, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 14-cr-143.

18,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2014 03:30PM ET</span>","Cubans imagine new, more prosperous life without an old foe","By Daniel Trotta 
HAVANA (Reuters) - From bus drivers to bartenders and ballet dancers, many Cubans are already imagining a more prosperous future after the United States said it will put an end to 50 years of conflict with the communist-run island. 
News of the historic shift echoed quickly through the Spanish colonial plazas of Old Havana, where strains of trova and son rose from outdoor cafes, Cuban music that is a siren song for foreign tourists. 
From the plaza outside Havana's 18th century cathedral, Daniel Guillen, 53, makes a living directing tourists to a nearby cafe, and he knows a flood of U.S. tourists would pump money into the area. 
""More yumas mean more consumption,"" he said, using a nickname for Americans. ""More consumption means more money. More money generates a better life."" 
Old Havana is a center of Cuba's tourism industry and boasts fine colonial buildings, some exquisitely restored but others in disrepair. It's an open secret that investors and developers hope one day to buy and fix up some of those homes as well as others across Havana. 
Cubans have been allowed to buy and sell homes only since November 2011, drawing some speculators and many Cuban Americans looking to return to their homeland, at least part time. But many believe the nascent property market could boom. 
Milly Diaz, of Havana-based Cuba Homes Direct, said on Thursday she had received a flood of enquiries since U.S. President Barack Obama announced on Wednesday that his administration would normalize relations with Cuba 
""We are anticipating an influx of foreign buyers as the smart money sees Cuba and Havana as a market with huge potential upside,"" Diaz said. 
Foreigners are still banned by the Cuban government from owning property, but have nevertheless played a small role in the real estate market. The foreigner demand comes mostly from Cuban Americans or foreign spouses of Cubans. 
For more than five decades, the United States sought to cripple Cuba's economy with a trade embargo. The country survived that, its own mismanagement, and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Never ousted, revolutionary leader Fidel Castro instead retired from power and handed off to his brother Raul. 
Unveiling a dramatic change in approach, Obama said on Wednesday that he would move quickly to normalize relations and ease some restrictions on travel, trade and banking. 
DANCING FOR JOY 
""I have no idea what it's like to live without being enemies with the United States but I imagine it will be magnificent,"" said Carlos Enrique Fernandez, 17, a ballet student who had just finished rehearsing at the National Ballet School and was still sweating and dressed in tights. 
Cuban ballet dancers often lack slippers and tutus, suffering from the shortages that are endemic to the Cuban economy and could be alleviated under normalized U.S.-Cuban relations. Like Cuba's prized baseball players, many defect to make more money abroad. 
There are still some potential barriers to a rapid change in U.S.-Cuba relations. 
While Obama can use executive powers to ease restrictions on commerce, banking and travel, he cannot entirely lift the 52-year-old economic embargo without approval from the U.S. Congress. 
And Cuba's communist leadership will almost certainly want to control the pace of economic change. President Raul Castro, who took over from his ailing older brother in 2008, has launched his own program of economic reforms at home but they are deliberately modest and slow-moving as he seeks to build what he calls a ""prosperous and sustainable socialism."" 
But on the streets of Havana, Cubans were already counting on a very different life after the embargo, known here as ""the blockade"" and always cited by Cuba's leaders as a cause of the economy's problems. 
The changes could open investment in telecoms equipment, construction, agriculture and infrastructure, but the first impact is likely to be in tourism and services. 
""There'd be more work for everybody,"" said Modesto Miguel del Hoyo, 50, a driver who had just dropped off a busload of South American tourists, 13 hours into his 16-hour work day. 
Del Hoyo's salary is 395 pesos a month, roughly $15, and he lives off tips. The tip jar on his dashboard was empty but as he imagined it filling with dollars, he broke into a smile. 
""I've been talking about this with everyone today, on every corner, and everyone is happy about this change,"" he said. 
Under the changes announced by Obama, travel restrictions on Americans will be eased though not yet completely lifted. 
After Canada, the United States already sends the second highest number of tourists to Cuba, mostly Cuban Americans and travelers on specially licensed ""people-to-people"" visits. 
Those travelers will soon be able to bring home $400 worth of goods, including $100 worth of alcohol and tobacco. The expected surge in U.S. visitors and lighter controls will bring a boom for sellers of Cuban rum and cigars and well as artists, musicians and the owners of restaurants and bed-and-breakfast businesses. 
""I'm going to have to toughen up and work a lot harder,"" said Lazaro Perez, who hand-rolls cigars at the tobacco shop at Havana's ornate Hotel Nacional, enjoying one of his own products. 
NON-U.S. COMPANIES 
Obama's policy change does not just affect commerce with the United States. Non-U.S. companies have been averse to doing business in Cuba because U.S. sanctions are far-reaching and force many investors who choose Cuba to forego the U.S. market. That risk, sometimes called the embargo tax, would disappear if the U.S. Congress agreed to lift the embargo entirely. 
Francisco Cerezo, the head of Latin American practice in Miami at Foley & Lardner, said his law firm had already received increased enquiries from Latin American banks, private family businesses and large corporations on what Obama's announcement means for their ability to invest in Cuba. 
""They want to understand how this impacts their Cuba strategy. They want us to walk them through how to position themselves long-term,"" he said. 
Amid the joy, however, some say that Cuba's casual approach to commerce needs to change. Doing business with the Americans means raising standards and the tourism industry will have to improve quality and service. 
Tourists come for the turquoise Caribbean waters and the rich history. Many leave disappointed with the shabby state of hotels and unappetizing buffet food. 
""There's no doubt that there will be a challenge for people in the non-state sector as more frequent visits from the Americans will require better service,"" said Renier Vichot, a 31-year-old cook at La San Cristobal, a private restaurant in central Havana. 

""A new era is starting with a future greatly influenced by North Americans landing in Havana. We've got to do better.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House does not dismiss the possibility of an eventual, precedent-shattering visit to Washington by Cuban President Raul Castro as part of President Barack Obama's plans to normalize relations with Havana. 
""I wouldn't rule out a visit from President Castro,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Thursday, a day after the two governments announced they would restore ties and open embassies after half a century of hostility. 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Roberta Jacobson, who is expected to visit Cuba in January, said renewed relations were not directly tied to progress on human rights in Cuba. 
""The president has had the leaders of both Burma and China to the United States,"" he said. By meeting such leaders, the United States can better influence countries to better respect universal human rights, he said. Republicans and some Democrats vowed to fight Obama's efforts to expand commercial ties with the communist-led island. Earnest shrugged off the threat that Congress would block the president. 
""The steps that the president announced are steps that are well within his executive authority,"" he said, and the White House was ""not particularly"" worried they could be stopped. 
Most legal experts have said the president has broad executive powers to ease restrictions on commerce, transportation and banking with Havana, even if Congress objects. 
The biggest obstacle to normal ties between the two countries is a decades-old embargo. With Republicans due to take control of both houses of Congress in January, chances are slim of lawmakers scrapping all sanctions on Cuba soon.

The private emails, leaked through a massive hacking attack on Sony Corp, included joking remarks related to U.S. President Barack Obama and his taste in movies. 
Pascal, who has publicly apologized, met with Sharpton Thursday to discuss the emails and perceived racial bias in the film industry. Sharpton's spokeswoman earlier this week had said he was weighing whether to call for Pascal's resignation.

Rules allowing foreign companies to sue host governments for unfair treatment have become contentious after recent high-profile cases, such as tobacco company Phillip Morris's challenge to Australia's plain packaging laws for cigarettes. 
Senator Elizabeth Warren, a staunch advocate for tougher scrutiny of Wall Street, said such rules would expose ""critical"" U.S. financial regulations to challenge and dissuade policymakers from writing rules that impact foreign banks. 
Warren and fellow senators Tammy Baldwin and Edward Markey wrote to U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman on Dec. 17 urging him not to include investment protection rules in the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). 
""The consequence would be to strip our regulators of the tools they need to prevent the next crisis,"" said the letter, released on Thursday. It also warned against rules limiting the use of capital controls or allowing open access for risky financial products. 
A USTR spokesman said the TPP would in no way limit the ability of governments to put in place strong consumer protections or to regulate financial markets and would include ""specific provisions protecting regulation."" 
Foreign investment protection is also a hot topic in a planned U.S.-Europe trade deal, prompting the European Union to call a halt to talks on that part of the pact while it consulted more widely. 
Five Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over trade, wrote to U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday urging him to exclude such rules from the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) too. 
There was no need for investor-state dispute settlement in an agreement between developed countries with established court systems, and excluding them would be ""more likely to generate broad public support,"" they wrote.

DAVENPORT, Iowa (Reuters) - Life-long Republican Bob Shelley neatly folds his newspaper and uses it as a coaster, placing his coffee mug over a photo of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who just announced he will explore a bid for the White House in 2016. 
In a coffee shop in this riverfront city, Shelley, 63, says he is not certain which Republican presidential candidate he'll vote for in 2016 But he knows Bush is not his man. 
""Why? We've just had enough of those people,"" he says with a laugh, referring to the Bush dynasty that has yielded two Republican presidents and two state governors. 
But when asked on the street, many Republicans in this key state are far less certain about their feelings for Bush. In Iowa, which holds the first presidential nominating contest in early 2016, voters are used to hearing out candidates before judging them, they say. 
That's true even for a 61-year-old former two-term governor who carries one of the best-known political names in recent American political history. Bush announced his exploratory candidacy on Tuesday. 
""This is a place that takes their vote very, very seriously,"" says Bruce Calhoun, 44, a realtor. 
""It's going to take all those folks to make their way here as often as they can, and not just one of these quickie stops,"" he said of the presidential contenders. 
Carol Crain, a volunteer at the Scott County Republican headquarters in downtown Davenport, said Republicans ""are hopping around right now"" between various potential candidates. 
""People want to know him. They may disagree with him on one or two issues but they may like him for 50 other things,"" Cain said. ""People have to get to know Jeb and see how he differs, or if he's the same as his brother."" 
The same holds true in New Hampshire, the other traditional early voting state. Tom Rath, a veteran state Republican strategist, said Bush's team knows he must woo support there one voter at a time like every other candidate. 
""They certainly know how New Hampshire works and know the requirements of his physical presence,"" he said in a telephone interview. 
Bush currently ranks near the top of what is expected to be a crowded Republican presidential field in most national and state polls. But pollsters say much of that is name recognition. 
""That also means he's more polarizing because a lot of people know the Bush name, but a lot of people don't like the Bush name,"" said Andrew Smith, a pollster at the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. 
Lisa Standhill, a 38-year-old Democrat, said a Bush candidacy would galvanize members of her party who have not forgiven former President George W. Bush, Jeb's older brother, for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
""Jeb will cause big waves. Anyone who was against the war, Democrat or Republican, will not want him near the White House. It brings up all those years people want to forget,"" she said while loading groceries outside a Walmart. 
While critics say two Bushes in the White House have been enough, family matriarch and former First Lady Barbara Bush overcame early doubts and is now fully behind her son's campaign, family sources say. His brother, George W. Bush has been a strong advocate, telling Reuters in a recent interview that he told Jeb ""you ought to run."" 
Some Iowa conservatives say they are encouraged by what they know about Jeb Bush. Outside Legacy Baptist Church, a church volunteer who would only give his name as Daniel said he prefers Bush because of the values held by his brother and their father, former President George H.W. Bush. 
""He comes from a family that is comfortable talking about faith, about God. We haven't had that. And we need that, especially now,"" he says. 
The state's conservatives have played a prominent role in past campaigns. Bush will face resistance from some of those voters, largely because of his support of legal status, but not full citizenship, for illegal immigrants. Bush also backs a Common Core education plan that has drawn fire from conservatives. 
But even if some question what Bush stands for, none question the power of the family brand. Three women on their way from Illinois to play the slots at a casino on the Mississippi River lit up at the mention of the Bush name. 

""He's as known as known can get,"" says Susan Montgomery, 47. ""Which means no surprises.""

29,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2014 01:04AM ET</span>",Fed eyes audit push as key political challenge in 2015,"By Michael Flaherty and Emily Stephenson 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is lobbying to stem a rising threat to its independence as the ""Audit the Fed"" movement, once seen as usual background noise, looks set to gain momentum in 2015 when Republicans gain control of both houses of Congress. 
Interviews with current and former Fed staff, lawmakers and lobbyists show that the central bank, led by Chair Janet Yellen, is taking the audit threat seriously. Fed officials are making their case for independence across Capitol Hill, reminding politicians of the damage that can come from political interference into economic policy discussions. 
""They're sensitive to all of these issues,"" said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. Reed said he had met with Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo in recent weeks but would not say what they discussed. 
The Fed is subject to various audits, including reviews by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). But since 1978, its monetary policy discussions have been legally exempt from a GAO audit and some politicians say it is time to open up those deliberations to more public scrutiny. 
The Fed fears that a full GAO audit would reveal too much detail of monetary policy decisions made by the Federal Open Market Committee. Fed officials have said such exposure would complicate their public communication, hurt their credibility and stoke market volatility. 
The central bank's stance on the issue was on display Wednesday, when Yellen was asked if she was worried about the Fed's independence. Yellen reiterated it was important to keep short-term political interests out of Fed policy decisions. 
""I certainly hope that (the GAO exemption) will continue and I will try to forcefully make the case to why it is important,"" she said. 
But Fed officials realize that boosting transparency has broad support, which is expected to grow as both Republicans and Democrats push for greater scrutiny over the central bank, its $4.4 trillion balance sheet, its regulatory powers and its plan to begin raising interest rates. 
While it remains to be seen if the Senate will take up the audit cause in 2015, Fed officials are actively lobbying. 
KEY TASK 
Loretta Mester, Cleveland Fed President since June, said she has met with lawmakers since taking the job, discussing independence and other topics. Meeting lawmakers will be a key task and regular part of the job, she said. 
""It's important for the Fed to be independent in its setting of monetary policy,"" said Mester, adding that the central bank is accountable to Congress and the American people. ""We want to be non-political in terms of how we evaluate monetary policy because it actually leads to better policymaking."" 
Fed Chair Yellen and other Fed officials, including half a dozen of its legislative affairs staff, regularly meet with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. From March to September, Yellen formally met or spoke with 15 U.S. lawmakers, according to her meeting calendar, made public by the Wall Street Journal through a freedom of information request. 
That routine is likely to intensify next year, according to Mark Calabria, a director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute think tank. 
""I would expect a lot more outreach on Yellen's part, a lot more lunches, particularly to the Senate banking committee and the new members."" 
In September, the House passed a bill that would require a full GAO Fed audit, reviving a 2012 measure. The ""Federal Reserve Transparency Act,"" passed the House by a 333-92 vote in September, but died in the Senate. 

""The likelihood of re-introduction of the audit bill is essentially 100 percent,"" said Calabria, a former staffer for Alabama Senator Richard Shelby, who is expected to take over as new Senate banking chair. ""The question is whether both the House and Senate pass it in its current form. Certainly the odds of it passing have greatly increased.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senator Mike Enzi said on Wednesday he will take over as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee next year after the panel's current top Republican, Jeff Sessions, agreed to step aside. 
The two senators had contested the chairmanship of the committee that will provide a key blueprint for Republican policy priorities as the party takes control of the Senate in January. 
Enzi, who had previously served as the top Republican on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, had decided to exert his seniority to become the Budget Committee chairman instead. 
That seniority literally came from the luck of a draw. When Sessions, an outspoken conservative from Louisiana, and Enzi, a more moderate senator who shuns the media limelight, both joined the Senate in 1997, they drew straws to determine who had greater seniority. Enzi, who is from Wyoming, won. 
But Enzi said that their agreement calls for Sessions to play a significant role on the panel in reforming welfare spending and identifying and eliminating government waste. 
""He is our first line of defense on many issues,"" Enzi said of Sessions. ""The team needs him and Jeff will be right there with his expertise taking the lead on welfare reform."" 
Some Republicans and outside conservative groups had said Enzi's challenge was a sign that Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell had wanted a more moderate senator in charge of the Budget Committee, whose work will help set federal spending levels for 2016. 
Enzi has denied this. A spokesman for McConnell said the new Senate majority leader has ""made clear that he has no role"" in the decision on who chaired the committee. 
Sessions said the two senators remain close friends and said he looks forward to assisting Enzi. 
""Mike is an accountant and a small businessman who understands the need to balance budgets and tell the truth about the numbers,"" said Sessions, who also will serve on the Armed Services, Judiciary and Environment and Public Works committees. 
Independent Senator Bernie Sanders will be the Budget Committee's ranking opposition member. The panel's exiting chairwoman, Senator Patty Murray, will move to become the top Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.

31,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2014 07:34PM ET</span>",Washington governor unveils carbon cap-and-trade plan,"By Rory Carroll 
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Washington Governor Jay Inslee on Wednesday laid out a plan for a carbon cap-and-trade program aimed at fighting global warming and raising $1 billion a year for state schools and public transportation initiatives, but he will first need the support of a divided state legislature. 
The program would place an overall limit, or cap, on the amount of carbon that large businesses and fuel distributors can emit. Those companies would then have the option to either reduce their carbon output, buy carbon permits at state-run auctions, or purchase permits from other businesses on the open market. 
However, the program faces an uphill battle politically since it will need the state legislature to sign off on the proposal before becoming law, including approval from the Republican-held state Senate. 
The proposal in many ways mirrors California's two-year-old cap-and-trade program, which, like Washington, also aims to help the state roll carbon emissions back to 1990 levels by 2020. 
Inslee plans to introduce legislation early next year with an eye toward launching the program in July 2016 and linking with the California market at a later date. 
Unlike California's program, Washington would not give any carbon permits for free to oil refineries, pulp and paper producers or gasoline distributors, which account for 85 percent of the state's output. 
Businesses will instead be required to purchase permits at the outset of the program. Permits are expected to be priced at around $12 a metric tonne in 2016, Inslee officials said. 
The cap-and-trade proposal is just one part of a suite of policies Inslee said he would spearhead next year to slash emissions and raise money to plug the state's budget gap. 
He also plans to push forward with a low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS), a program that requires fuel producers to gradually reduce the carbon content of transportation fuels they produce. 
LCFS programs are also controversial. California's LCFS has been the target of lawsuits by out-of-state fuel producers, who claim it unfairly targets their products. 
In a speech on Wednesday, Inslee warned that there would be ""alarmist attacks"" directed at his plan. 
""Corporate polluters have launched aggressive campaigns against similar efforts in other states and have already begun to do the same here in Washington,"" he said. 
On Wednesday the Washington Consumers for Sound Fuel Policy, which represents oil producers and other business groups, called Inslee's plan a $1 billion ""hidden tax"" on Washington fuel consumers.

32,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2014 06:26PM ET</span>","From joy to outrage, Florida's Cuban-Americans greet new U.S. policy","By Zachary Fagenson and David Adams 
MIAMI (Reuters) - Some Cuban exiles responded with outrage. Others with ecstasy. 
News on Wednesday that the United States will restore diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time in more than a half century divided America's 1.5-million-strong Cuban exile community and threatened to shake up the political landscape in the vital battleground state of Florida. 
The reaction in Florida, which is home to about 80 percent of the nation's Cuban-American population, reflects a generational shift in an exile community whose powerful political influence in the United States and steadfast support for the Republican Party helped keep U.S. sanctions on Cuba in place for decades. 
But with President Barack Obama's vow to push for ""an honest and serious debate"" about lifting the United States' long-standing economic embargo against Cuba, many Cuban exiles welcomed the turn, seeing a chance for more engagement with the homeland they left behind. 
""It's amazing,"" said Hugo Cancio, who came to Miami in the 1980 Mariel boatlift and runs a magazine with offices in Miami and Havana. ""This is a new beginning, a dream come true for the 11.2 million Cubans in Cuba, and I think it will provoke a change of mentality here too in this community."" 
""I'm ecstatic,"" he added. ""I've been working for this moment for 25 years"". 
Such enthusiasm was not universal. In Miami's Little Havana neighborhood, occupants of passing cars screamed ""Obama traitor"" in Spanish. Other people on a sidewalk shouted ""Obama communista."" 
""This is nothing to be happy about,"" said Maria-Angeles Martinez, 50, who joined a crowd voicing displeasure at Versailles, a popular Cuban restaurant. ""I don't believe in talking about anything with the Castros. It's freedom or nothing."" 
Hardcore foes of former Cuban President Fidel Castro and his brother and current President Raul Castro have been a potent political force in Florida, one of the country's most hard- fought states in presidential elections. 
""DRAMATIC OVERREACH"" 
Older exiles who oppose any opening to Cuba still wield considerable influence. Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor who on Tuesday said he was actively exploring a presidential bid in 2016, was quick to criticize the White House's move to restore diplomatic ties as ""dramatic overreach."" 
But the diehard anti-Castro generation is aging. And with many younger exiles having arrived since 1980 with no direct memories of life under Castro and many more Cuban-Americans born in the United States, there is a younger generation of Cuban-Americans that is more pragmatic and more influenced by the needs of relatives who remain in Cuba. 
Obama's announcement could complicate efforts by Bush, a Republican, to rally support for a presidential bid in a Cuban-American community whose divisions may be accentuated by a restoration in diplomatic ties. Many Republicans have struggled to win the presidency by taking Florida's Electoral College votes, which at 29 ties it with New York as No. 3 among the U.S. states in electoral votes. Obama won Florida twice. 
Bush, whose father, George H.W., and brother George W. were both U.S. presidents, is considered the Republican frontrunner in the 2016 race for the White House. 
Obama's announcement on Cuba was welcomed by younger Cuban-Americans who have increasingly pushed for change and vote Democrat in growing numbers, a contrast to older exiles who believe President John. F. Kennedy - a Democrat - betrayed them during the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. 
""It's no exaggeration to say that this is a historic day,"" said Pedro Freyre, a Cuban-American attorney in Miami who was formerly a Republican and a one-time hardliner on Cuba but now calls himself a conservative Democrat. ""I think it is the right thing to do at the right time."" 
Some Cuban exiles embraced the prospect of trying something new with Cuba after so many years. At Sergio's, a popular Cuban restaurant in Miami, Octavio De Armas, 62, speculated about the future of an island he left as a child, as he sipped a Cuban espresso sitting at a outdoor patio. 

""If things like this cafe can start happening there, if people can have a better life, I'm all for change,"" he said.

33,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2014 05:41PM ET</span>","Secret talks in Canada, Vatican City led to Cuba breakthrough","By Warren Strobel and Lesley Wroughton 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The historic breakthrough in U.S.-Cuban relations began in spring 2013, when President Barack Obama authorized secret talks with Havana, the same tactic he used to open nuclear negotiations with Iran. 
Months of talks in Canada and at the Vatican, involving one of Obama's closest aides, culminated on Tuesday when Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro spoke by phone for nearly an hour and gave final assent to steps that could end a half-century of enmity and reshape Western Hemisphere relations. 
Obama believed that ""if there is any U.S. foreign policy that has passed its expiration date, it is the U.S.-Cuba policy,"" said a senior Obama administration official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity. 
The Vatican played a key role in the rapprochement, including facilitating talks on the release of Alan Gross, a former subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development who returned from Cuba on Wednesday after five years' imprisonment, U.S. officials said. 
In early summer 2014, Pope Francis - who is from Argentina - sent separate personal letters to Obama and Castro, urging them to exchange captives and improve relations. 
When the pope received the U.S. president in Vatican City in late March, the secret Cuba talks were a central topic of discussion. Cuba ""got as much attention as anything else,"" the official said. 
The first face-to-face talks that eventually led to this week's deal took place in June 2013 in Canada, which has long maintained relations with Cuba. 
Leading the U.S. delegation were Ben Rhodes, a close Obama aide who is a deputy national security adviser, and Ricardo Zuniga, the top Latin American specialist on the White House's National Security Council. The names of the Cuban participants in the talks could not immediately be learned. 
U.S. and Cuban prisoners were a major point of debate, the officials said. 
For the Obama administration, Gross' continued imprisonment was both a practical and political barrier to improved ties. 
Secretary of State John Kerry spoke by phone four times this summer with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez about Gross, a second senior U.S. official said. 
Kerry told the Cubans that if anything happened to Gross, there would never be better relations between Washington and Havana, this official said. 
VATICAN ENGAGEMENT 
The Vatican got involved as early as March 2012, when a group of U.S. lawmakers went to the papal ambassador's office in Washington's posh Embassy Row section and pleaded for help. 
Since then, through a Vatican transition from Pope Benedict XVI to Pope Francis, ""it has always stayed on the Vatican's radar,"" said Senator Barbara Mikulski, from Gross' home state of Maryland. ""They talk to higher powers. I don't know if it's radar or angels, Cherubim, Seraphim - they go for it."" 
In the talks, Washington also insisted on the release of a spy for the United States who had been languishing in a Cuban prison for nearly two decades. 
The unidentified individual ""was instrumental in the identification and disruption of several Cuban intelligence operatives in the United States,"" the office of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in a statement. 
Among the Cuban operatives unmasked by the agent were a senior U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency analyst and members of a Florida-based spy ring known as the ""Wasp Network."" 
Cuba insisted on the release of three members of the network, Cuban intelligence agents who had served 16 years in U.S. jails. 
In the talks, there were also clear signs of unresolved disputes. The Cubans reiterated calls for an end to U.S. pro-democracy programs in Cuba, which Havana has long viewed as a thinly disguised attempt to overthrow its communist system. Washington did not accede to those demands, the first senior official said. 
The transfer of prisoners was finalized at a key meeting at the Vatican, the official said. The date of that session is unclear. 
5 A.M. FLIGHT TO HAVANA 
At 3 a.m. EST (0800 GMT) on Wednesday, Gross' congressman, Maryland Democrat Chris Van Hollen, awoke to catch a 5 a.m. flight to Havana. His group, which included Gross' wife Judy, Republican Senator Jeff Flake and Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, arrived at 8 a.m. at an airport outside the Cuban capital. 
""We went into a room. We were escorted there by a couple of Cuban officials, and in the room was Alan Gross, along with two American officials who were part of the Interests Section,"" Van Hollen said. 
Gross, he said, ""looked very frail, but his spirits were very high."" 
Gross's lawyer had told him in a phone call on Tuesday that he was to be released. After a pause, Gross replied, ""I'll believe it when I see it,"" according to a spokeswoman, Jill Zuckman. 
On the plane home, Zuckman said, Gross found some favorite foods: popcorn, a corned beef sandwich with mustard on rye bread, and potato pancakes known as latkes. For Gross, who is Jewish, it was a special day -- the first day of Hannukah. 
At 8:45 a.m., the pilot announced the plane had left Cuban airspace. Said Zuckman: ""Alan stood up on the plane and took a deep breath at that moment.""

TUCSON, Ariz. (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Ron Barber, an Arizona Democrat and former aide to Gabrielle Giffords, has officially lost his re-election bid to the Republican challenger in November's congressional elections, a judge certified on Wednesday. 
A superior court judge declared Martha McSally, a retired Air Force colonel and a pioneer of women's combat aviation in the 1990s, the winner after a state-mandated recount showed she won by 167 votes in the Nov. 4 election. 
""There's no getting around that this was an incredibly close and hard-fought race. After what's been a long campaign season, it's time to come together and heal our community,"" McSally said in a statement. 
This was the last seat still being contested following the mid-term elections and gives the Republicans a 247-188 majority in the next House of Representatives. 
Barber, who has served in Congress since a 2012 special election to replace Giffords, congratulated McSally in a statement and thanked his constituents. 
Giffords' former district office director before she was shot and wounded in a 2011 rampage that left six dead and 18 wounded, Barber was himself shot in the face and leg in the same incident. 
McSally has already been appointed to the House Armed Services and Homeland Security committees - both important to her district, which includes Davis-Monthan Air Force Base and is about 80 miles of the Mexico border. 
She lost a Republican primary in the 2012 special election to replace Giffords, and then unsuccessfully challenged Barber in a newly-drawn district as he sought re-election in a race that began immediately after Barber's special election victory. 
Since McSally's win in last month's election was within a margin of 0.1 percent - fewer than 200 out of about 220,000 votes - state law required the recount, which was done by machine and by hand by Pima County election officials. 
""I sincerely thank Congressman Barber for his service over many years to southern Arizona. I'll be seeking his input to continue strong constituent services and help ensure a smooth transition,"" McSally said.

Senior U.S officials, previewing Obama's 12 p.m. ET announcement, said the United States and Cuba will move to open embassies in each other's capitals. Obama spoke on Tuesday to Cuban President Raul Castro to discuss the changes in a call that lasted nearly an hour. 
The shift will mean a relaxation in the flow of commerce and transportation by the United States to Cuba, the officials said. 
As part of a prisoner swap under the new policy, Cuba freed American Alan Gross in exchange for three Cubans held by the United States, the officials said. Cuba is also releasing a U.S. intelligence agent held for nearly 20 years. 
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will review Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. 
""These steps will be the most significant changes to our Cuba policy in more than 50 years,"" a senior administration official told reporters. ""What we are doing is beginning the normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba."" 
The official said the United States and Cuba will be intitiating high-level contacts and visits with Cuba. 
""We will be immediately initiating discussions with Cuba to reestablish diplomatic relations that have been severed since 1961,"" the official said. 
One official said the policy was being changed because of a belief within the Obama administration that the longstanding U.S. embargo against Cuba was not working.

It was not immediately clear where the Pentagon would carry out heavy maintenance of the F135 engine that powers the fighter planes. The engine is made by United Technologies Corp's Pratt & Whitney unit. 
According to Nikkei, sources said U.S. officials chose Japan for the maintenance hub because U.S. military personnel stationed there could run the center and because of the country's extensive technology industry. 
Japan is also finishing work on a large final assembly and checkout plant for the new warplanes at a cost of more than $1 billion.

Rosekind, an expert on human fatigue, has spent the past four years as a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates major transportation accidents. The Senate confirmed his appointment by unanimous consent late Tuesday. 
He joins a small agency that has been without a permanent chief since David Strickland resigned a year ago. Deputy Administrator David Friedman has been running NHTSA in the interim. 
NHTSA has come under fire from safety advocates and members of Congress for its perceived slow response to two major scandals this year: defects in Takata air bags and General Motors ignition switches.

""I'm very concerned like all of you have been with the slowness across all of the recalls,"" Rosekind said. 
The defective Takata air bags, which can rupture upon deployment and spray metal shards into cars, have been linked to at least five deaths.

McConnell told reporters that the bill would be based on a measure that failed in the Senate last month that was co-sponsored by North Dakota Republican John Hoeven and Louisiana Democrat Mary Landrieu. 
""It'll be open for amendment,"" McConnell said. ""I will hope that senators on both sides will offer energy-related amendments but there'll be no effort to try to micromanage the amendment process."" 
Landrieu pushed for a Keystone vote in November in a last-ditch effort to persuade voters in energy-rich Louisiana to re-elect her to a fourth term. 
But her gambit fell just one vote short of Senate passage despite winning significant support from Democrats. Landrieu was solidly defeated in a Dec. 6 runoff election by Republican Representative Bill Cassidy, setting the Senate's final post-election split at 54 Republicans to 46 Democrats. 
But even with Senate control, Republicans still may find it difficult to win the 67 votes needed to override a veto from President Barack Obama. 
Obama had been widely expected to veto the November measure forcing approval of TransCanada Corp's project, which would connect Canada's oil sands to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. A Nebraska court will soon rule on whether the state's governor had the right to push through the pipeline's route through the state, and Obama has questioned whether the project would do anything to lower fuel prices in the United States or simply facilitate petroleum exports. 
Construction workers, unions and energy companies say the pipeline, which would transport more than 800,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta through Nebraska en route to the Gulf of Mexico, would create thousands of jobs. 

But the project has galvanized environmentalists who say developing Canada's oil sands would spike carbon emissions linked to climate change and that much of the oil or refined products would be sold abroad.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's new plan to ease the threat of deportation for 4.7 million undocumented immigrants violates the U.S. Constitution, a federal judge found on Tuesday, handing down the first legal ruling against the plan. 
The ruling has no immediate impact, with the government saying there was no reason for Judge Arthur Schwab of the Western District of Pennsylvania to address the issue in the case, which concerns 42-year-old Honduran immigrant Elionardo Juarez-Escobar. 
Schwab is the first judge to rule on the legality of the plan Obama announced on Nov. 20. The executive action by the Democratic president is opposed by Republicans and is already subject to other legal challenges. 
Schwab ruled that the executive action violated the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of separation of powers and the separate ""take care clause,"" which requires the president to faithfully execute laws passed by Congress. 
Schwab says he ruled on the executive action issue because he concluded that Juarez-Escobar could be eligible for relief under the executive action. 

Government lawyers told Schwab that Juarez-Escobar, who has pleaded guilty to re-entering the country, was not eligible because Obama's order does not affect criminal proceedings.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Tea Party firebrand who nearly provoked the second government shutdown in a little over a year, on Tuesday apologized to his fellow Republicans for a strategy that backfired. 
A Cruz spokeswoman said the senator apologized to colleagues ""for inconveniencing their personal schedules"" over the weekend. Cruz still believes, the spokeswoman said, that fighting to stop President Barack Obama's new program easing deportations for millions of illegal immigrants ""was critically important."" 
The apology to Republican senators came at a closed-door lunch when Cruz, a possible 2016 presidential candidate, ""was contrite and made an effort to explain to people he wished he hadn't done it,"" said a source familiar with the meeting. 
Cruz sparked a public rebuke by fellow Republican senators. They criticized the Texan for forcing the Senate to be in session Friday night and through Saturday because he refused to allow quick passage of a $1.1 trillion bill keeping the government running beyond midnight Saturday. 
Cruz's actions inadvertently allowed Democratic leaders to advance nearly two dozen Obama nominees. These included Sarah Saldana, chosen to head the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Republicans had been trying to block some of those nominations. 
Some Republican senators had been privately talking up the need to punish Cruz, according to Senate Republican aides. 
Among ideas were possibly denying Cruz committee assignments or ""blocking him from being able to offer things,"" one aide said. 
Senator John Cornyn, second-ranking Senate Republican and Cruz's fellow Texan, noted ""persuasion,"" rather than punishment, was the coin of the realm. 
""One of the good things about being a United States senator is that any individual senator can pursue any tactics that they choose to pursue and there's not much anybody else can do about it,"" Cornyn said. 
Republicans won big in Nov. 4 elections, gaining control of the Senate and expanding their majority in the House of Representatives. The party appeared to be coming together after a series of election cycles pitting Tea Party activists against mainstream Republicans. 
But fissures on display last week signaled it might be complicated for the party to challenge Obama. 
In September, 2013, Cruz and House conservatives collaborated to hold up a spending bill to keep the government operating. The goal that time was to gut another Obama initiative, the healthcare law known as Obamacare. 

That episode resulted in a 16-day shutdown. This time, Cruz relented hours before the government was set to begin shuttering agencies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dozens of temporary tax breaks, including big ones for business research, wind power and foreign profits, were renewed by the U.S. Senate late on Tuesday, putting to rest worries that further delays in dealing with the so-called tax extenders might foul up the approaching tax-filing season. 
The Senate approved legislation sent from the House of Representatives that renews retroactively, back to Jan. 1, 2014, a 55-item package of tax breaks. Most of them expired at the end of 2013 and have since been in limbo. 
The legislation, which passed the Senate 76-16, will be sent to President Barack Obama for signing into law. 
In a floor speech before passage, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden said: ""With this tax bill, the Congress is turning in its tax homework 11 months late...this package of tax incentives will last just two weeks before families and businesses are thrown back into the dark with respect to the taxes they owe. The legislation accomplishes nothing for 2015."" 
In calling on Congress to provide greater certainty for taxpayers next year, Wyden added, ""The Congress is about to pass a tax bill that doesn't have the shelf life of a carton of eggs."" 
Nevertheless, not just big businesses, but ordinary Americans are affected by extender provisions for items such as state and local sales tax, canceled mortgage debt, college tuition, schoolteacher supplies and health insurance. 
The measure would be good through the end of this year. If Obama signs it, that would mean taxpayers could claim the tax breaks for the 2014 tax year, but Congress would have to debate them all over again in 2015. 
The bill was projected to cost U.S. taxpayers $41.6 billion over 10 years. No new federal revenue sources were dedicated to fully offsetting that cost, which means it would increase the federal budget deficit. 
The extenders usually win short-term renewal and extension from Congress every year or two. 
Nearly half of the total 10-year estimated cost comes from the three largest items: a $7.6 billion credit for business research and development costs; a $6.4 billion tax break for renewable energy production plants; and a $5.1 billion tax exception that allows financial firms and other businesses to defer U.S. taxes on certain foreign profits. 
Another tax break, known as bonus depreciation, allows businesses to write off and deduct capital investments more quickly at an estimated 10-year cost of $1.5 billion.

48,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2014 08:10AM ET</span>",U.S. terrorism insurance bill killed by objections in Senate,"By David Lawder and Emily Stephenson 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bill to extend an expiring federal terrorism insurance program effectively died on Tuesday when the U.S. Senate failed to reach an agreement to hold a vote before Congress wraps up its business for the year. 
The program, created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that provides a federal insurance backstop for owners of skyscrapers, sports stadiums and other large projects that could face terrorism threats, is now expected to lapse at year-end. 
Congress will need to reintroduce the measure in January in both the Senate and House of Representatives. 
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the bill was ""killed"" because retiring Oklahoma Republican Senator Tom Coburn had wanted to make last-minute changes and would not drop his objections. 
""We all know if we change the bill, it's gone,"" Reid said on the Senate floor, adding that any changes would mean that it would have to be sent back to the House of Representatives. 
The House passed the measure last week, but has left Washington for a holiday break until Jan. 6. 
""They're gone, they're not going to change anything in the bill. We've been told that many times,"" Reid said. 
In a final act as a Senator, Coburn had objected to a section of the bill that creates a licensing program to allow insurance agents to sell across state lines. 
Coburn said he wanted states to be able to opt out of the program and wanted the measure to expire in two years. The House-passed bill would extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act for six years and double the threshold for losses at which the backstop kicks in to $200 million. 
Lawmakers created the terrorism insurance program after the 2001 attacks, when insurers lost money and threatened to stop offering insurance against the chance of similar attacks. 
The program has enabled developers of large projects such as shopping malls to build and gain coverage at lower costs. The federal backstop has never been triggered. 
While the House and Senate could act quickly in January to take up renewal of the program, its lapse could cause delays in financing approvals for large development projects. 
""We hope the House will pass a bill quickly because billions of dollars of projects and hundreds of thousands of jobs are at risk,"" said Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat who has pressed for the program's renewal. 
House Republicans included in the bill language tweaking the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law to exempt ranchers, energy businesses and other so-called ""end users"" of derivatives from certain requirements. 
Many Democrats, who lost a battle last week over including Dodd-Frank changes in a $1.1 trillion government spending package, were bitterly opposed to changing the law again in the terrorism bill. 

The White House had said it opposed including Dodd-Frank modifications in an unrelated bill but stopped short of threatening to veto the insurance extension.

49,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2014 08:10AM ET</span>",U.S. to unveil plan to curb oil and gas sector methane soon: sources,"By Valerie Volcovici 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration as soon as Wednesday will announce its plans for curbing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, which the United States must do to meet its 2020 target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, people familiar with the issue said Tuesday. 
The government reaffirmed that goal last week at U.N. climate talks in Lima. 
The Environmental Protection Agency said it would announce its administration-wide methane strategy by the end of the fall. Administrator Gina McCarthy hinted recently that the agency will combine voluntary actions with some regulation, which would need to be finalized by 2016. 
People familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the plans could come out as soon as Wednesday. 
Methane emissions, the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions with 9 percent of output in 2012, are expected to rise. 
The EPA may seek to address them by imposing curbs on methane leaking from oil and gas production, and by tightening standards for emissions from landfill and agriculture. 
Rick Duke, associate director for energy and climate at the White House, said at United Nations climate talks in Lima last week that curbing methane could help the United States meet its target to cut greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and 26-28 percent by 2025. 
Environmental groups want the administration to target methane directly from existing facilities rather than voluntary guidelines. 
""The administration needs the extra tonnes to be able to make both of those international commitments,"" said Conrad Schneider of the Clean Air Task Force. ""It would be devastating to them to announce they will not do that before the ink is dry on the Lima agreement."" 
He called methane the ""missing piece of the puzzle"" of President Barack Obama's Climate Action Plan, which relies on executive actions to achieve emission cuts. 
The centerpiece of the strategy is the Clean Power Plan, which targets carbon emissions from existing power plants. Researchers say this only gets the United States part of the way to the 2020 target. 
""The Clean Power Plan is a huge component of the Climate Action Plan, but it's insufficient,"" said Kate Larsen, director at researchers the Rhodium Group. ""You really need to attack each of the sectors to achieve enough reductions."" 
An October report by the group projected methane emissions will grow 5 percent by 2020 without any efforts to curb them.

Senators voted 55-38 to approve Blinken to serve as deputy secretary of state, with almost all votes in favor from Democrats. 
Blinken, a longtime adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, is currently Obama's deputy national security adviser. Opposition to his confirmation was led by Republican Senator John McCain, a frequent critic of the president's foreign policy. 
McCain blasted Blinken as ""abysmally ignorant"" in a heated speech before the vote. The Arizona lawmaker had delayed Blinken's confirmation process earlier this month, citing sharp disagreement with the nominee's past statements on Iraq. 
""This individual has actually been dangerous to America and to the young men and women who are fighting and serving it,"" said the veteran senator, who will be chairman of the Armed Services Committee in the new Republican-led Senate. 
Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, the current chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, defended Blinken as eminently qualified. Blinken's resume also includes time as a senior foreign relations committee staff member.

51,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2014 08:10AM ET</span>",Top Democrat says regional banks key to Wall Street win on derivatives,"By Amanda Becker and Emily Stephenson 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday said unpopular Wall Street banks got a long-sought rollback to Dodd-Frank reforms through Congress last week partly by leveraging the influence of smaller banks that hold greater sway with lawmakers. 
""They have been working for a long time, trying different strategies on it,"" California Representative Maxine Waters said in an interview. ""The big banks are in trouble with most legislators... so they put the regional banks in front of them in order to gain more support."" 
Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co wanted to turn back a provision in the Dodd-Frank law that would have forced banks to push derivatives trading into separate units. The ""push out"" rule would have boosted banks' trading costs.  
The rollback was included in the $1.1 trillion spending package passed by Congress that funds most government agencies through September 2015. 
Wall Street banks launched a full-court press this year to get the provision into that bill, lawmakers and congressional aides said. Banks wanted a vehicle most lawmakers would feel compelled to vote for before the rule took effect in July 2015. 
""They knew this was a must-pass bill,"" Waters said. 
The derivatives rider, first offered by Kansas Republican Representative Kevin Yoder, was agreed on by a bipartisan team negotiating the omnibus spending package. 
Many Democrats criticized it as going easy on Wall Street. Appropriators said they fought off worse changes to the law and won higher funding for two key regulators. 
Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan, personally called lawmakers before they voted on the package. President Barack Obama dispatched a top deputy Thursday to encourage House Democrats to vote for the compromise. 
But in interviews after the bill passed, bank lobbyists and Hill staffers said the words ""Wall Street"" were anathema to most lawmakers. They said banks such as SunTrust and Fifth Third, which had ties to local lawmakers, actually got the changes across the finish line. 
Regional bank representatives met with Hill lawmakers and Treasury officials and participated in conference calls, congressional staffers and lobbyists said. 
Yoder's spokesman, CJ Grover, said the lawmaker proposed the amendment because smaller regional banks and farmers used derivatives to manage risk. 
Waters, however, said the biggest U.S. banks were the beneficiaries of the Dodd-Frank change. 

""The big banks tried to hide behind the regional banks,"" she said. ""That's what it's all about.""

The ruble has plunged more than 50 percent this year versus the U.S. dollar, thanks in part to slumping oil prices and Western economic sanctions, dropping more than 11 percent on Tuesday. 
""If I was chairman of President Putin's council of economic advisers, I would be extremely concerned,"" said Jason Furman, the chairman of Obama's Council of Economic advisers. 
""They are between a rock and a hard place in economic policy,"" Furman said, noting the country has raised interest rates to defend its currency, hurting the domestic economy and confidence. 
""It's a serious economic situation that is largely of their own making and largely reflects the consequences of not following a set of international rules,"" Furman said. 
He said the United States has limited exposure to the Russian ruble crisis, with exports to Russia accounting for only a tenth of one percent of the U.S. gross domestic product. 

But other economic slowdowns around the world do present a challenge to the United States, Furman said, citing weakness in Europe and Japan, and slower growth in China.

(Reuters) - California pension plans would divest all assets related to the coal industry under a measure the leader of the state senate said he will propose to reduce support for an industry that critics blame for contributing to climate change. 
Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León said on Monday he would introduce a bill that would require state pension plans to divest from coal assets. He had just returned from United Nations talks in Lima, Peru on international efforts to fight climate change. 
At the NextGen Climate Leadership Forum in Oakland, de León said divesting state pension funds from coal would ""provide another example of how California leads and defines the future economy."" 
The California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, the two largest U.S. pension funds, together hold almost a half trillion dollars worth of assets. 
""Any efforts to undermine our climate change policies are undermining our global leadership and the future of our economy. The world is watching and we can't stop now,"" de León said in a prepared statement. 
In response, CalPERS said it was working aggressively to engage with fossil fuel companies to ensure they are taking appropriate action to manage the physical and capital risks associated with climate change. CalPERS invests in approximately 30 coal mining and producing companies with holdings valued at approximately $167 million. 
""We firmly believe that engagement is the first call of action, and results show that it is the most effective form of communicating concerns with the companies we own,"" spokesperson Brad Pacheco said in an emailed statement. 
CalSTRS, too, said it wanted to proceed with caution and ""carefully weigh our duty to perform profitably with consideration of environmental, social and governance impact of those investments."" 
Measuring ""the ultimate impact of our investment in coal"" is on the pension fund's radar for the coming year, CalSTRS said. It said preliminary assets in global coal investments totaled $800 million, part of a $100 billion global equities portfolio.

MIAMI (Reuters) - A federal jury in Florida found a former Miami-area mayor guilty of six counts of wire fraud on Tuesday, part of a scheme that used straw buyers and false mortgage applications to collect millions from lenders. 
Marie Lucie Tondreau, 54, was taken into custody and will face up to 30 years in prison at sentencing in March. 
Prosecutors said Tondreau, a Haitian-American activist and radio host, used her notoriety in Miami's Caribbean community to recruit people to provide their information for up to $10,000 to complete falsified mortgage applications. 
Throughout the two-week trial her supporters, sometimes as many as two dozen, gathered in the courtroom. 
A few let out sobs as U.S. District Judge Robert Scola Jr. announced he would not permit Tondreau to remain free on bond until her sentencing. She was elected North Miami's first female Haitian-American mayor in 2013 and was indicted and suspended from office in May 2014. 
Between 2005 and 2008 Tondreau brought in 13 individuals whose identities were used to buy 20 Miami-area homes that were rented out for profit, according to prosecutors. 
The $11 million mortgage fraud scheme unraveled when one straw buyer was contacted by a lender about an overdue mortgage payment, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Lois Foster-Steers. 
""When he went to her for help ... Ms. Tondreau said he had money in his pocket, and he shouldn't complain,"" Foster-Steers said during closing arguments on Monday. 
Defense attorneys laid blame on Tondreau's onetime fiancée Karl Oreste, who they said led the scheme and misled Tondreau, using her reputation to bring in buyers. Oreste pleaded guilty to seven wire fraud charges in July and is due to be sentenced early next year. 
Neither Oreste, who was expected to take the stand as a government witness, nor Tondreau testified. 
She is one of about a half dozen Miami-area mayors to face charges of wrongdoing over the past two years. 
Former Miami Lakes Mayor Michael Pizzi, accused of accepting bribes from undercover FBI agents, was exonerated by a federal jury in August. Former Homestead Mayor Steven Bateman will be sentenced on Friday after being found guilty in September of two felony charges tied to holding a consulting job while in office.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A White House task force on Tuesday issued proposals to tighten the grip on the illegal global seafood trade, which the group said causes billions of dollars in losses to the legal fishing industry annually. 
Under the plan, the United States would create a program to trace seafood entering its ports from the source to the shelves, to prevent illegal products from getting into the domestic market. 
The recommendations would compel Congress to grant several federal agencies the authority to search, inspect and seize illegal seafood at U.S. ports and on sale, and to prosecute offenders as part of the wider effort to combat ""pirate fishing."" 
U.S. President Barack Obama formed the task force in June with representatives from 14 federal agencies to tackle illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, as well as seafood fraud that includes mislabeling, misbranding and falsification of product origins. 
Federal agencies estimate that illegal seafood trade causes up to $23 billion in annual losses globally and is one of the biggest threats to the world's fisheries and oceans. 
Up to 90 percent of seafood consumed in the United States is imported, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. 
A study published in the journal Marine Policy in April found that up to 32 percent of wild-caught seafood imported into the United States in 2011 was illegal. 
""Pirate fishing vessels take in fish without regard to the sustainability of ocean ecosystems,"" the White House said on a statement on its website on Tuesday. ""Not required to file trip plans or carry transponders, the ships roam the oceans in the shadows and become vectors for human, drug, and arms trafficking."" 
The task force recommended that curbing illegal fishing be included in free trade deals and U.S. agreements with other countries to fight illegal trafficking of drugs, weapons and people. 
Under these recommendations, the U.S. Trade Representative would coax foreign governments to commit to ending subsidies to their fishery sectors by 2020. Such subsidies, the group says, encourage over-fishing and contribute to illegal activity. 
The task force said the rules would create a level playing field for legitimate fishers and boost consumer confidence in seafood sold in the United States.

Between Nov. 15, when enrollment opened, and Dec. 12, nearly 2.5 million people signed up in the 36 states where these plans are sold through the HealthCare.gov website, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in an e-mailed statement that also appeared on its blog. 
Data from states that operate their own websites, such as California and New York, is not included in the agency's figures. 
The government said that of those who signed up on HealthCare.gov during this four-week period, 1.28 million were renewing plans they had purchased for 2014. 
The enrollment period ends on Feb. 15. 
""Open enrollment, in our view, has just begun,"" Andy Slavitt, principal deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said during a call with reporters. 
Individuals had until Monday to purchase a plan if they wanted coverage to begin on Jan. 1, although those with 2014 coverage were automatically re-enrolled and some states running their own exchanges extended that deadline by several days. 

In addition, Slavitt said, on Monday more than 1 million people phoned the federal call center, rather than use the website. Call-center workers were unable to complete the enrollment process for hundreds of thousands of them. The workers are continuing to call them back, and although the Dec. 15 deadline passed, these customers' coverage will begin on Jan. 1.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday confirmed President Barack Obama's choice for a senior immigration enforcement job, defying Republicans who tried to block the nomination to protest Obama's executive order granting deportation relief to undocumented immigrants. 
Sarah Saldana, currently the chief U.S. prosecutor in Dallas, Texas, was confirmed on a 55-39 vote to be director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
She will be the first Latina to run the agency. The position has been vacant for over a year, including a period over the summer when child migrants from Central America surged across the U.S. border with Mexico. 
Obama nominated Saldana in August and she initially enjoyed bipartisan support. But leading Republicans decided to oppose her after Obama announced in November he was easing the threat of deportation for some 4.7 million undocumented immigrants. 
Republicans accuse Obama of exceeding his authority by acting unilaterally and bypassing Congress with the order, which they say amounts to ""amnesty"" for illegal immigrants. Once Saldana publicly supported Obama's move, Republicans like Senator John Cornyn, a fellow Texan who had effusively praised her nomination, turned against her. 
""I was proud to support her,"" Cornyn said in the Senate on Tuesday. ""Unfortunately the president changed everything ... This is the situation in which the president has put a good and decent person like Sarah Saldana."" 
Democrats said that if Republicans were angry with Obama they should deal with it by passing legislation reforming immigration laws. The Senate did so in June 2013, but the House of Representatives never took up the bill. 
""It appears to me that their (Republican) feelings about this president have reached a point they're not thinking clearly,"" the Senate's number two Democrat, Dick Durbin, said. 
""They cannot announce that first we need to make sure we stop the flood of illegal immigrants and then refuse to fill the position responsible for administering that responsibility."" 
There are more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Obama's plan would let some who are parents of U.S. citizens and permanent legal residents temporarily stay in the United States and get work permits. 
Saldana's confirmation was part of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's push to get nominations through the Senate before Republicans take power next year. Reid hopes to get about 20 more nominees confirmed this week.

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura has sued HarperCollins Publishing, saying he was defamed in passage from a book it put out from an ex-Navy SEAL who claimed the two were in a bar fight. 
Ventura, who in July won more than $1.8 million in damages from the estate of former SEAL Chris Kyle, filed suit in federal court in Minnesota on Monday against HarperCollins over the best-selling book ""American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History."" 
""HarperCollins published a false and defamatory story about Ventura and subsequently used that story to promote 'American Sniper' for its own economic advantage and gain,"" the lawsuit said. 
A spokeswoman for HarperCollins said the company does not comment on pending litigation. 
Ventura is seeking an unspecified amount in damages for what he claims is unjust enrichment and defamation. 
Kyle, killed in 2013 at a Texas shooting range by a troubled Iraq war veteran he was trying to mentor, wrote in the book that he got into a fight with a man identified as ""Scruff Face"" who made disparaging remarks about the Navy SEALS. 
Kyle later identified the man as Ventura. 
Lawyers for Ventura, who first gained national attention as a professional wrestler with a penchant for feathered boas, said his reputation was left in shambles by the passage. 
Ventura felt vindicated when the jury this year returned a decision declaring the bar fight story to be a lie, Ventura's lawyers said. 
HarperCollins, a subsidiary of News Corp, said in July the passage in the best-seller would be removed, without offering further details. 
Lawyers for Kyle's estate contended Ventura's career was already fading and the defamation case was aimed at keeping his name in the headlines at the expense of an ex-SEAL who served his country with honor. 
Ventura, a former member of the Naval Special Forces Underwater Demolition/SEAL teams, was Minnesota's governor from 1999 to 2003, after running as a third-party candidate. 
A feature film based on Kyle's book, directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Bradley Cooper, is due out later this month.

(Reuters) - Long a legislative lion for Democrats, Barney Frank retired from Congress two years ago. But he remains famously shrewd and caustic, feisty and funny, as well as the most prominent gay politician in the nation. With current roiling debate over the financial reform that Frank helped to legislate, along with his frequent appearances on CNBC and the publication of his memoirs in March, he's back in the spotlight. 
Frank was in the U.S. House of Representatives for 32 years. In Congress, he was the controversial Democratic leader on the House Financial Services Committee and was a co-sponsor of the eponymous 2010 Dodd-Frank act, which brought sweeping reform to the financial industry. Now 74 and married, when he's not on TV or relaxing on the coast of Maine, he's giving paid speeches and teaching at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. 
David A. Kaplan recently talked to Frank for Reuters in mid town Manhattan. During a wide-ranging exchange, in his characteristic Bayonne-meets-Boston mumble, Frank discussed the 2016 presidential election and his fear of Chris Christie; his prediction on a Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage; the future of Dodd-Frank; his disappointment over President Obama; his distaste for Jon Stewart; and why, no, he didn't cause the 2008 financial crisis. Edited excerpts:

Q: Would you encourage President Obama to consider not signing the bill? 
A: Yes. 
Q: And thereby shutting down the government? 
A: He could say, ""Send me the same bill without the provision [affecting Dodd-Frank]."" Any shutdown would be brief. 
Q: Did supporters of changing Dodd-Frank, even a little, miscalculate politically? 
A: Yes, Republicans misread public opinion. So did the Senate Democratic leadership and the White House. 
Q: And the banks themselves—the ones affected by Dodd-Frank? 
A: They're not concerned with public opinion. 
Q: What will Republicans do in terms of further rollback since they'll soon be in control of Congress? 
A: Given the response we just saw, it will be difficult for them to make any major changes in the face of what I am now confident will be very loud public disapproval. 
Q: Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was most vocal in opposing the current bill. How do you think she comes out? 
A: She showed she's a force to be reckoned with. 
Q: Do you miss not being part of the legislative action? 
A: I wouldn't want to have had to be involved in complex negotiations. But I was glad to speak out last week. 
Q: Are you happy with how Dodd-Frank has been implemented so far? 
A: Yes, with one exception. There's been one chip-away, but it came a coalition of left and right, with the support of lenders, realtors, homebuilders and in particular, advocacy groups. I wanted to say that no mortgage loans could be made and then 100-percent securitized without risk-retention; people refer to that metaphorically as ""skin in the game."" But to get the bill through, we had to give in to create a special category of super-safe loans that didn't have to be risk-retained. I also was disappointed the Republicans under funded the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the SEC, but that hasn't really done any harm. Ideally, I'd have liked to merge the SEC and the CFTC. 
THE SCOURGE OF POLITICS 
Q: What do you think of the midterms? 
A: I'm discouraged by more than simply the God-awful turnout. The root of our problem is people who are frustrated we haven't produced for them economically. You get into a vicious cycle in which people are disappointed in government because it hasn't delivered, so they then get mad at government and vote for people who dislike government, which makes it even less likely that government will do anything for them. 
Q: What's the fix? 
A: There are two things we should do to free up money. One, and I'm sorry the President appears to be back-pedaling on this, is cut military spending. And the time has also come for Democrats to look at the environmental issue. Part of that community makes two mistakes. They take a morally superior tone. It's possible to support laws on climate change, but still understand it will have a negative impact on some people and figure out how to compensate them. Not every environmental issue has the same moral importance. 
Q: So, better turnout next time isn't the solution? 
A: We have to persuade white guys that we really do care about their economic interests. 
Q: Do the midterms portend badly for Democrats in 2016? 
A: Not so much. We have a temporary advantage in that the Republicans are so badly split that they're going to have a hard time putting together a ticket that gets unified support. They're going to have the same problem (Mitt) Romney had. 
GAY RIGHTS 
Q: Has the velocity of change gay rights surprised you? 
A: It's astonishing. I filed the first gay rights bill in Massachusetts history in 1972. And at any time these past 40 years, if you'd asked me to say, ""Where's it going to be three years later?"" I'd have been wrong. 
Q: Is that speed a function of the progressivity of the American people? 
A: Absolutely. If it hadn't been for gender equity and race, we wouldn't have gotten started. But once we did, the reason [for progress] is simple: We're much less different. Almost every straight person has gay and lesbian friends, relatives, etc. When we all started saying who we were, people realized it didn't make any difference. Reality beat the prejudice. 
Q: Will the U.S. Supreme Court rule on same-sex marriage? 
A: Yes, next year. Of course they'll say yes. Unless [Justice] Ruth Ginsburg dies. But then they'll still say yes because it will be a 4-to-4 tie. Based on his prior votes [in other gay rights case], I'm sure [Justice Anthony] Kennedy is going to vote to uphold same-sex marriage. 
Q: So, you predict 5-to-4? 
A: Yes. Potentially 6-to-3, if [Chief Justice John] Roberts joins, but I doubt it. I was struck by what they did recently—their refusal to act. [Without comment, the Court let stand lower-court rulings that upheld a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.] There's a perfect sports analogy. They gave same-sex marriage an intentional walk. They weren't going to let us hit a home run, but they weren't going to try and get us out. 
THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE: 2016 
Q: Would you support Hillary [Clinton]? 
A: Pretty enthusiastically. I have slight differences with her on foreign policy—she's more hawkish. But the reality's going to force Democrats into a less intervention position. And you have an appealing candidate. So I'm supporting her and I'd urge others not to run against her. 
Q: Think there's a chance others will? 
A: No, especially because it doesn't look like we have the luxury of a fight. After the midterms, it's particularly hard for anybody who's thinking about running against her from the left. 
Q: Who will the Republicans nominate? 
A: They have a terrible problem. You have Jeb Bush on the one hand who has real problems on the right. You have Rand Paul or even a [Marco] Rubio who have a certain implausibility. God is not that much of a Democrat for Ted Cruz to get nominated. 
THE GOP AS LEADERS 
Q: Will the GOP behave differently now that it controls both houses of Congress? 
A: The real problem is House-versus-Senate. You're going to see great dysfunction. The House Republicans are a very right-wing group, They understand they're going to have a hard time getting anything done, so they're preemptively blaming Obama for their own failure to get together. 
Q: Is current congressional dysfunction unique in U.S. history? 
A: You have to go back to the Civil War. Things were not ground down under George W. Bush, (Bill) Clinton, George H.W. Bush, [Ronald] Reagan, or [Jimmy] Carter. It starts in 2011. In 2009 and '10, we passed financial reform and health care. We repealed ""Don't ask, don't tell."" We did women's pay equity. Go back to W. You got No Child Left Behind, the prescription drug program. Under Clinton, even when Republicans were impeaching him, he was still working on a budget deal. 
Q: What will break the fever? 
A: If the Republicans lose badly in '16. The Democrats take back the Senate, win the presidency, and make gains in the House…Usually when a party goes far to the extreme, as the Republicans did in '64 with Goldwater, or the Democrats in '72 with McGovern—they're punished at the polls. What was unique in 2010 was Republicans went to the right, but so did the country. It was anger over the things we had to do to respond to the financial crisis. So the Republicans didn't get penalized. 
Q: Which '16 Republican candidate would worry you most? 
A: Chris Christie maybe, although that bridge scandal was bad. But he'll have terrible trouble getting the nomination, because there's this perception of him being more moderate. 
Q: More so than Jeb Bush? 
A: If I thought Bush, I would have told you Bush. 
Q: He's articulate and thoughtful, and from an important state electorally. 
A: And he's a Bush. And his brother went out very unpopular. There's a sense of establishmentism. Christie conveys a sense of being an outsider. 
Q: If Hillary doesn't run, would Senator Warren be interested? 
A: Of course she'd be. Who's got an ambition in life to be a Triple-A shortstop? 
OBAMA 
Q: You've praised Obama at times, even though you initially supported Clinton in 2008. What are the lessons from his presidency? 
A: He misunderstood partisanship in its best sense. I was worried when he said in 2008 he was going to be post-partisan, It gave me post-partisan depression…His mistake was to think you can talk your way out of things and undervalue the reality of genuine disagreement. You win the right to cooperate only by being tough to start with. He skipped that part. 
Q: Is his failure related to race? 
A: Obviously he got elected. And I don't think that's why Tea Party members of Congress were so bad. But the whole birther thing was clearly based on race. And by the way, any sense that race is not a big factor in America is totally refuted by Ebola. If Ebola had broken out in Israel or Ireland, rather than with black people in Africa, it would be treated very differently here. 
THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008 
Q: In prior financial epochs like Enron and the S&Ls, people went to jail. Why not this time? 
A: The abuses in many cases weren't yet illegal—ethically awful, but not illegal. 
Q: Was the Justice Department too timid? 
A: I think so. But liberals have to remember that an essential element of due process is you shouldn't be convicted on behavior that's ambiguously criminal. Part of it, though, was early on [prosecutors] were worried about the fragility of the economy, and those other things—Enron, Tyco, World Com—didn't occur when the economy was on the brink. 
Q: Why would a fragile economy deter prosecutions? 
A: Because you'd make it more fragile by crashing institutions and high-level individuals. 
Q: Are you given insufficient credit for supporting free enterprise? 
A: I have a fundamental philosophical view, which is we have two systems in our democratic, capitalist society: private sector and public. In the private sector, the more money you have, the more influence you have. That's how a market economy works. If you work harder, you get more money…And that's a good thing. (But) the public sector is supposed to be one-person, one-vote. But weak campaign-finance laws allow you to buy more influence. You're supposed to be able to buy influence in the private sector, not in the public sector. 
Q: Don't people get the government they deserve? 
A: I agree absolutely. My formulation is this: politicians make a lot of mistakes, the press drives me crazy, and voters are no bargain, either. But part of the problem is unequal money. 
Q: What do you mean by ""voters are no bargain, either""? 
A: It's interesting that the institution the public values the least is the one in which they have the greatest input in selecting: Congress. 
PRESS PROBLEMS 
Q: If the press were so influential, wouldn't Paul Tsongas have been elected president in 1992? 
A: The press is very different today. It's a major contributing factor to pro-right-wing, anti-government feeling. Because even the liberal press is anti-government. Ever watched Jon Stewart say anything good about government? 
Q: He's part of the problem? 
A: Him and others. The effect is to tell people it doesn't make any difference who they vote for. I differentiate Bill Maher from Jon Stewart. Maher's very funny, but also has good and bad guys on the show. You say, ""Oh, I agree more with this side than that side."" You come away from Stewart and especially [Stephen] Colbert, and say, ""Oh, they're all assholes."" 
Q: Is your media critique that different than it would've been a generation ago? 
A: The most active people in society live in parallel media universes, which only reinforce what they believe. That's one reason we don't get compromise. Because when people who represent one faction try to compromise, they're told by supporters, ""Why are you doing this?"" If the response is, ""We didn't have the votes,"" you hear, ""Of course you have the votes. Everybody I know is for it."" 
Q: Isn't there some good in how the Web makes information more accessible? 
A: Before the Internet, if you read something, except on a bathroom wall, people generally had to persuade somebody else that what they said had some plausibility. The Internet destroys that. 
Q: Shouldn't I expect my legislators to be smarter than to believe the echo chamber reflects reality? 
A: You missed the point entirely. You have the people who are going to vote for you overwhelmingly threatening not to vote for you if you compromise. If you think elected officials are entirely indifferent to their voters, you're wrong. 
Q: Might there not also be – God forbid I use the phrase—a ""silent majority""? 
A: Not who vote in primaries. 
Q: Is your press critique an argument for greater press regulation? 
A: No. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? 
Q: Say again? 
A: Who will guard the guardians? 
Q: What do journalists not ask you that they should? 
A: Good question. There's this misperception about who did what during the financial crisis, and particularly the irony that it was conservatives pushing for subprime loans. The liberals were trying to regulate them! There's been this great historical effort by conservatives to suggest otherwise. 
Q: Trying to turn you into the bad guy? 
A: Yeah. In 2007 a Wall Street Journal attacked me because we had a bill to restrict subprime loans. They said, ""Don't you want poor people to have homes? These loans are wonderful—80 percent of them are paying off."" That's not a very good percentage. 
PRIVACY IN PUBLIC 
Q: Is it fair game for journalists to speculate about the sexual orientation of public figures? 
A: There's a right to privacy, not a right to hypocrisy. If you're gay and you're voting for anti-gay stuff, then you should be outed. Let me ask you this: If the leader of the right-to-life movement got his daughter an abortion, would you publish that? 
Q: I'd have trouble. Because it's the daughter's privacy. 
A: If [gun-control advocate] Sarah Brady had an Uzi, would you report it? 
Q: Yes. That's not within the zone of privacy. 
A: Why not? 
Q: It's not about health, sexuality, finances, religion, and so forth. 
A: Here's the deal: Nobody thinks there's a zone of privacy as to whether or not you're heterosexual. 
Q: So if someone is gay that's not in a zone of privacy that journalism ought to respect? 
A: I didn't say you would go out [a public official]. I said it would be a good thing if he did it. 
‘TOO HARD ON PEOPLE' 
Q: What do you know now that you wished you'd known 30 or 40 years ago? 
A: I didn't fully understand how to integrate a democratic society with a capitalist system. I also wish I had a better sense I could be too hard on people. I've gotten a little gentler—being less explicit when I thought something was incredibly stupid. 
Q: Do those amount to regrets? 

A: Most people tell me that a lot changed when I fully came out in '87. If you muffle your sexuality and try to have your career make up for it, I believe that infects your career.

60,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2014 10:15AM ET</span>",Obama likely to sign two bills that could impact arms sales ,"By Andrea Shalal 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to sign in coming weeks two bills passed by Congress despite concerns raised by U.S. officials that they could add time and cost to the already complex process for approving foreign arms sales. 
One bill would allow leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate foreign affairs committees to request 30-day notification of certain arms shipments to specific countries, if concerns arose after the sales were approved. 
The other would require more elaborate explanations about how major arms sales to the Middle East would affect the ""qualitative military edge"" that U.S. law mandates for Israel. 
Both measures, passed as part of wider bills by Congress this month, aim to give lawmakers more oversight over arms sales at a time of rapid political and national security changes in the Middle East. Neither has drawn a White House veto threat. 
U.S. officials, speaking on background, said the provisions could slow approval of foreign arms sales and add administrative costs for the U.S. government, but the president was unlikely to veto the bills, given their importance to U.S. allies. One permits the transfer of older U.S. warships to Mexico and Taiwan; the other underscores U.S. strategic ties with Israel. 
The State Department, Pentagon and White House had no immediate comment on the provisions. 
Industry executives, who are counting on foreign arms sales to offset declines in U.S. military spending, said the provisions could further complicate the complex process for winning approval of weapons sales to U.S. allies abroad. 
Congress has already revised the first measure to account for some of concerns raised by the Obama administration. 
It now requires both the leader and ranking member of the Senate and House foreign relations committees to back a request for an arms delivery notification, instead of just one, and applies only to government-to-government, not commercial, sales. 
One Senate Republican aide said the measure would improve transparency by allowing Congress for the first time to monitor actual arms shipments, without adding new obstacles. 
One U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the government would need a new process for tracking such shipments, which often occur years after a sale is approved. 
Andrew Shapiro, who previously headed the State Department office that oversees foreign arms sales, said the provision would only be used in cases involving ""significant events"" and did not give Congress the ability to block sales. 
The other bill requires the administration to spell out more specifically how major weapons sales to the Middle East would affect Israel's ""qualitative military edge."" 
Such issues are already addressed in classified documents provided to Congress in conjunction with the proposed sale of major weapons to the Middle East, but the new measure would beef up that analytical process, said Shapiro, currently managing director of Beacon Global Strategies. 

It requires a detailed explanation of Israel's ability to respond to the improved capabilities, how a sale would alter the balance in the region, and whether the U.S. government had made any security assurances to Israel in conjunction with the sale.

61,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2014 09:39AM ET</span>",U.S. bill mandating community banker on Fed board nears passage,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - (This Dec. 15 story, corrects political affiliation of Vitter to Republican in 4th paragraph) 
When the U.S. House of Representatives approved a terrorism insurance bill last week, it contained a little-noticed provision that would require at least one member of the Federal Reserve's board to have community banking experience. 
    That provision appears destined to become law in what would mark a rare change to the composition of the U.S. central bank's governing structure. 
The U.S. Senate plans to vote on the House bill later this week. An earlier version of the legislation that cleared the Senate also contained the provision, suggesting it will sail through once again as lawmakers wrap up business for the year. 
    Several members of Congress, including the provision's initial sponsor, Republican Senator David Vitter, have called on President Barack Obama to tap a community banker for one of the two vacant spots on the normally seven-person Fed board. 
    These lawmakers, as well as community bankers themselves, have complained that a tightening of bank regulation since the financial crisis has put an unnecessary heavy burden on smaller lenders and should be targeted more carefully at big banks. 
    Many lawmakers worry that big Wall Street firms hold undue sway at the U.S. central bank and see adding a community banker as a way to temper that. The bill would require that at least one member of the Fed's board to have experience working at or supervising banks with $10 billion of asset or less. 
    While the Fed board is supposed have representatives from different parts of the country, the central bank has never had to reserve a specific seat for a particular business interest. 
    ""The claim that community banks should have a Fed board seat is no stronger than the claim that trade unions should, or mid-sized banks or (JPMorgan CEO) Jamie Dimon,"" said Justin Wolfers, a University of Michigan economics professor. 
    ""It's a bad practice and not consistent with central bank practices around the world."" 
    Fed board members are appointed by the president, subject to Senate confirmation.

62,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2014 08:19PM ET</span>","Accused of rights abuses, North Korea urges U.N. meeting on CIA torture","By Michelle Nichols 
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea on Monday asked the United Nations Security Council to add the issue of torture by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to its agenda as the council prepares to hold a meeting next week on alleged human rights abuses by the Asian state. 
The council is due to meet on Dec. 22 or Dec. 23 on human rights in North Korea after two-thirds of the 15-members pushed for the issue to be added to the body's agenda. A U.N. report in February detailed abuses in North Korea that it said were comparable to Nazi-era atrocities. 
Once an issue is on the Security Council agenda, it can be discussed at any time. Majority support is needed to add an item to the agenda and cannot be blocked by the five veto-wielding powers - China, Russia, the United States, France and Britain. 
Diplomats said it was not likely that enough countries would support a council meeting on torture by the CIA. 
""The so-called 'human rights issue' in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) is politically fabricated and, therefore, it is not at all relevant to the regional or international peace and security,"" North Korean U.N. Ambassador Ja Song Nam wrote in a letter to the council. 
""The issue of CIA torture crimes committed by the United States needs to be urgently addressed in the Security Council since it threatens to have an imminent and destabilizing impact on the maintenance of international peace and security,"" he added. 
A U.S. Senate report released last week found that the CIA misled the White House and public about its torture of detainees after the Sept. 11 attacks and acted more brutally and pervasively than it had acknowledged. 
North Korea called for the Security Council to establish ""an ad-hoc investigation commission mandated to make a thorough probe into the CIA torture crimes and hold those responsible to account for their most serious human rights violations."" 
A U.N. committee last month urged the council to consider referring North Korea to the International Criminal Court, alleging crimes against humanity. China, likely supported by Russia, would probably veto any referral to the international court based in The Hague, diplomats say. 
China's U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi said he opposed adding human rights in North Korea to the Security Council agenda. 
""The situation on the Korean peninsula is so complex and so precarious (that) what the council should do is work towards maintaining peace and stability on Korean peninsula and not to do something on the contrary,"" he told reporters on Monday. 
Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said the issue should be dealt with by the U.N. Human Rights Council. 

""If they have the meeting, I won't be heartbroken over it, but I think it's improper to do it at the Security Council,"" Churkin said on Monday.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (Reuters) - Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam will call a special session of the state Legislature to consider a plan aimed at providing healthcare coverage to state residents who either do not have insurance or whose options are limited, he said on Monday. 
    The ""Insure Tennessee"" plan is seen as an alternative to the Obama administration's signature Affordable Care Act. That measure, known as Obamacare, has faced strong opposition in several Southern states, which also have large numbers of uninsured residents. 
The Tennessee plan ""leverages federal dollars to provide health care coverage to more Tennesseans, to give people a choice in their coverage, and to address the cost of health care, better health outcomes and personal responsibility,"" Haslam's office said. 
The Republican governor said his plan had received verbal approval from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In addition to getting legislative approval, the state must submit a waiver to HHS. 
Craig Becker, president and chief executive of the Tennessee Hospital Association, applauded the plan. 
""The working uninsured in our state currently find themselves in a coverage gap that results in limited access to healthcare. Insure Tennessee can close this gap and help our neighbors and loved ones find quality coverage and access to care,"" he said in a statement.

64,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2014 07:31PM ET</span>",Pentagon weighs U.S. funding bill impact on terrorism fight,"By David Alexander 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon is scrambling to assess the impact of Congress' decision last week to approve only a third of the requested funding on the U.S. counterterrorism fight in Syria and Africa, the department's budget chief said on Monday. 
An appropriations bill approved on Saturday contained $1.3 billion of the $4 billion President Barack Obama sought for a new Counterterrorism Partnership Fund to counter al Qaeda affiliates in Africa and train Syrian moderates to fight Islamic State rebels. 
""We got a lot less flexibility than we asked for. So we'll really need to dive in with our attorneys and figure out how ... would we actually implement this with less money and more restrictions,"" Pentagon Comptroller Mike McCord said in an interview. 
He said Congress separately approved about $1.6 billion to help Iraqi forces battle Islamic State rebels. 
McCord said the Pentagon initially thought it would use about $1 billion of the $4 billion fund for the Syria conflict, with about half going to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels and half going to help border states deal with spillover effects of the conflict. 
""We had a variety of things that we had hoped to do both on the counter-ISIL (Islamic State) effort but also in Africa Command,"" McCord said, noting Africa had been a ""real beneficiary"" of the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund. 
McCord said Syria would probably be the main priority after the reduction in spending authority because language in the bill prevented the Pentagon from using other money for that effort. 
The Senate on Saturday gave final approval to a $1.1 trillion appropriations bill funding the government, including $577 billion for defense. The measure is expected to be signed by Obama soon. 
McCord said the military service branches were reviewing that bill and the defense policy bill passed on Friday to determine whether they need to make last-minute changes in their 2016 budget plans, which will be released early next year. 
McCord said he expected the Pentagon to ask Congress for more than the nearly $500 billion limit set for 2016 by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which called for the department to reduce projected spending by about $1 trillion over a decade. 
Unless current law is changed, an appropriation of over $500 billion would lead to across-the-board budget cuts known as sequestration to reduce spending to the level set by statute.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate confirmed the long-delayed nomination of Dr. Vivek Murthy for surgeon general on Monday, as Democrats pushed to approve some of President Barack Obama's stalled choices for government posts before Republicans take power in Congress next year. 
Obama's pick for the top U.S. public health job was approved 51-43. Earlier, Murthy barely cleared a procedural hurdle after he drew opposition over his support for stricter gun regulations. 
Obama applauded the Senate and said in a statement that Murthy would ""help us build on the progress we've made combating Ebola, both in our country and at its source."" 
The Senate will vote on Tuesday on another contentious nominee, Sarah Saldana. Her nomination to head the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office became bogged down after she said the president's executive action on immigration was legal. 
The Senate scheduled votes on Murthy, Saldana and three other nominees for Monday and Tuesday as part of Majority Leader Harry Reid's push to get nominations through the Senate before it goes home for the year. 
Reid hopes to move about 20 more nominees later this week in a process he started over the weekend, when delaying tactics by conservative Republicans on a government spending bill kept the Senate in session unexpectedly and gave him an opening. 
Last year, Democrats infuriated Republicans by changing Senate rules so government nominations can advance to confirmation votes by a simple majority of the 100-member Senate, rather than a 60-vote supermajority. 
Still, some nominations have languished. Obama nominated Murthy a year ago, but some Republicans and the National Rifle Association criticized his gun-control views. Senator Ted Cruz, a conservative Republican, called Murthy an ""anti-gun activist."" 
Murthy, who has been working as an internal medicine physician in Boston, also advocated the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature health initiative and anathema to most Republicans. 
Supporters of Murthy noted more than 100 public health organizations endorsed him, calling him a ""well qualified, forward-thinking, innovative leader with a strong commitment to public health."" 
""Does that sound like a political hack when 100 organizations say that about this doctor?"" said Senator Dick Durbin, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat. 
Two other nominees cleared procedural votes Monday: Daniel Santos to serve on the Defense Nuclear Facilities board, and Frank Rose as assistant secretary of state. 
On Tuesday, the Senate will vote on Saldana and Antony Blinken, nominated for the No. 2 post in the State Department.

RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, on Monday called to reinstate restrictions on the purchase of handguns, in a move that opponents described as unlikely to succeed with a Republican-dominated legislature. 
McAuliffe asked lawmakers to reinstate a law allowing buyers to purchase only one handgun a month, which had been repealed during his Republican predecessor's administration. He also wants to require private vendors at gun shows to run background checks on all prospective buyers. 
""At gun shows, private vendors are not required to conduct criminal background checks, creating an easy avenue for criminals to illegally gain access to guns,"" McAuliffe said. His call came the day after the second anniversary of a gunman's rampage in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 26 elementary school students and educators. 
McAuliffe also aims to revoke concealed weapons permits for parents who are delinquent on child support payments and prohibit the possession of firearms for misdemeanor domestic violence offenders. 
The head of a Virginia gun-rights group called the move political payback to former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an ardent gun-control activist who was a major donor to McAuliffe's 2013 gubernatorial campaign. 
""I think this is all politically motivated,"" said Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, a gun rights group. ""If anything, Virginia is more pro-gun than it was last year."" 
The National Rifle Association, meanwhile, has said it financed $500,000 in ads on television and online striking out at McAuliffe's views on firearms. 
In 2013, gun sales in Virginia set a new high with nearly 480,000 transactions, according to state police statistics on the number of mandatory criminal background checks of gun purchasers. 
Gun sales grew 10.8 percent over the previous record set just a year earlier. 
Overall sales could be even higher, because state police don't track private firearm transactions. Final sales numbers for 2014 aren't in yet. 
Thomas Baker, a criminologist and an assistant professor at Virginia Commonwealth University's L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs, said McAuliffe's gun control proposals could spur even more gun sales. 

""Usually, when new policies restricting firearm purchases are proposed, we see a rise in firearm sales,"" Baker said

There has been intense speculation that Bush, brother of former President George W. Bush and son of former President George H. W. Bush, may be gearing up to enter the White House race as a Republican candidate. 
In a television interview that aired on Sunday, Bush said releasing the emails showed his commitment to transparency in public service. 
""I'll let people make up their mind,"" he said in the interview with WPLG Local 10 News, an ABC affiliate. 
""There's some funny ones. There's some sad ones. There's some serious ones,"" added Bush, who was governor of Florida from 1999-2007. The emails will be released early next year. 
Bush, 61, has said he will make up his mind on running by the end of the year. He has not said which way he is leaning as he travels the country raising his profile, including a visit on Monday to speak at a commencement ceremony at the University of South Carolina, a key primary state. 

His famous name would bring connections to a powerful network of Republican donors and he has been publicly urged to run by his father and brother.

68,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2014 12:07PM ET</span>",Texas lawmakers put new gun rights laws in their sights,"By Jim Forsyth 
SAN ANTONIO (Reuters) - Several proposed new gun laws await the new Texas legislature when it opens next month, including one to allow open carrying of handguns in public and another providing a sales tax holiday for firearms purchases. 
The Republican-dominated legislature will become even more conservative due the party's landslide win in the November election, with many members pledging to expanding firearms rights in the state often seen as an incubator of conservative policies nationwide. 
Proposed measures would ban cities and counties from restricting gun rights and try to have any new federally imposed restrictions on firearms declared illegal in Texas. Lawmakers are also looking to prohibit schools from punishing students who fashion their breakfast pastries into the shape of a gun. 
""We have so many gun bills that have been filed that we can't have anything but an open carry law passed next year,"" said C.J. Grisham, founder of the activist group Open Carry Texas. 
The group has been pushing for the unlicensed open carrying of handguns, pointing to laws in Texas and elsewhere that allow for the unlicensed open carrying of long guns such as rifles. 
Current Texas law grants citizens the right to carry concealed handguns with a permit. 
An open carry measure seems likely with nine pieces of legislation up for consideration and Governor-elect Greg Abbott, a Republican who takes office in January, saying he supports the move. 
There has been some push back after members of Open Carry Tarrant County were criticized for endangering public safety by staging rallies this year where armed members took to streets, stores and restaurants seeking support for their cause. 
In response to a wave of school shootings across the United States, some conservative Texas lawmakers advocate measures that would make it easier for teachers and administrators to carry weapons, arguing that this is a way to prevent violence. 
A so-called ""Pop-Tart bill"" to bar punishment for children who make firearms inferences has attracted much attention. It was inspired by the case of a Maryland school that suspended a second-grader for chewing a breakfast pastry into the shape of a gun. 
""The bill is a proactive effort to prevent even the chance of a Texas student losing valuable instruction time due to an act of non-disruptive, non-threatening behavior by a child,"" said State Representative Ryan Guillen, a Democrat sponsoring the bill.

69,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2014 07:58AM ET</span>","UK lawmakers will ask U.S. for secret parts of CIA report, to scrutinize UK spies","By Andrew Osborn 
LONDON (Reuters) - A powerful British parliamentary committee will ask the United States to hand over blacked out parts of a report into the CIA, to try to establish whether British spies were complicit in torture or rendition, its chairman said on Sunday. 
If parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) saw evidence of such behavior, it could summon politicians from the left-leaning Labour party such as former prime minister Tony Blair who were in power at the time of the allegations. 
""If British intelligence officials were present when people were being tortured then they were complicit in that torture,"" Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the ISC's chair and a former foreign secretary, said. 
""That would be quite against all the standards of this country. It would be something that ought to be brought into the public domain,"" Rifkind told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. 
A report by the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee released last week found that the CIA had misled the White House and the public about its torture of detainees after the Sept. 11 attacks and had acted more brutally than thought. 
Its publication has already raised uncomfortable questions in Poland and other countries identified as being involved in the program about how much their leaders knew. 
The British government said it had asked the United States, a close ally, to keep parts of the report referring to UK intelligence activity secret on national security grounds. It insisted it was not covering up anything embarrassing. 
Britain's foreign and domestic security services, known as MI6 and MI5, have for years been accused of colluding in the ill-treatment of suspected militants. 
But the heads of MI5 and MI6 have repeatedly said they would never use torture to gain information, and ministers have also denied knowledge of sending suspects to face torture abroad. 
However, a Libyan dissident asserts he and his pregnant wife were kidnapped by U.S. forces in 2004 with the help of MI6 and handed over to Muammar Gaddafi's government, which tortured him. 
A Pakistani man also says he was waterboarded by British special forces in Iraq in 2004, and a former Labour security minister says there may have been ""the odd case"" when British spies knew of U.S. torture. 
Rifkind said his committee would be asking both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. government to give it access to the relevant parts of the report into the CIA as part of its own inquiry into the work of Britain's intelligence services. 

If necessary, he said the committee would summon spies and current and former ministers to learn the truth. He said he hoped his committee's report into the matter would be ready next year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York's police union is showing its displeasure with Mayor Bill de Blasio and the head of the city council by starting a campaign to keep the two politicians away from funerals of fallen officers. 
The campaign follows harsh criticism of de Blasio by Patrick Lynch, the head of the union, who said the mayor had failed to support the police after a grand jury decided against indicting a white officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner. 
Since the grand jury decision on Dec. 3, protesters have taken to New York streets to vent their anger over Garner's death in July and to call for reforms in how police use force. 
New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association posted a form on its website, for members to sign, that requests that de Blasio and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito keep away from funeral services should an officer die in the line of duty. 
The mayor and other senior city officials traditionally attend the funerals of fallen officers. 
The form, entitled ""Don't Insult My Sacrifice,"" accused the pair of ""consistent refusal to show police officers the support and respect they deserve."" 
In response, de Blasio and Mark-Viverito released a joint statement saying the union's campaign was divisive. ""Incendiary rhetoric like this serves only to divide the city, and New Yorkers reject these tactics,"" local media quoted them as saying in the statement. 
De Blasio has made it clear that he is concerned by Garner's death and how police treat African-Americans in general. Immediately after the grand jury's decision in the Garner case, the mayor said he had warned his bi-racial son Dante to take special caution in any dealings with police officers. 
On Saturday night, following an incident during which police said two officers were assaulted by protesters, the mayor condemned the violence which he said marked ""an ugly and unacceptable departure from the demonstrations thus far."" 
""Those who reject peaceful protest and provoke violence can expect immediate arrest and prosecution,"" de Blasio warned. 

Largely peaceful protests have taken place nightly in major U.S. cities since a grand jury returned a no indictment decision after a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, in August. The protests have intensified since the decision on the Garner case and other police shootings in New York and Cleveland.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The fine print of a massive $1.1 trillion spending bill before the United States Congress includes a passage considered a ""high priority"" by lawmakers that could resolve a burning issue among the country's 40 million anglers: does the federal government need to regulate fishing tackle? 
The unexpected provision buried in the 1,603-page bill tracks back - as so much legislation does in Washington - to an influential lobbying group, the National Rifle Association. 
The NRA, which represents American gun owners and sportsmen, wants to stop the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from regulating the lead content of both fishing tackle and firearms ammunition. 
Conservationists have long clamored for a crackdown, partly due to concerns about lead in drinking water, but the debate has outraged some hunters and fishermen. 
Republicans in the House of Representatives this week used the spending bill to try to block federal interference. 
""It was a House priority,"" said one Republican aide familiar with the provision in a bill that the Senate weighed in a rare weekend session. 
An NRA publication called the efforts to regulate lead in ammunition and fishing gear ""hysteria."" The powerful gun rights group also contends the regulation is not backed by sound science. 
The Republican-run House Appropriations Committee touts the provision as protecting Americans' constitutional right to bear arms by fending off a government assault on ammunition as well as tackle. 
The American Sportfishing Association advanced a practical argument against Washington's meddling: ""Non-lead fishing tackle products can cost from ten to 20 times more than lead products. Non-lead products may not be as available and most do not perform as well."" 
Dale Denney, whose company Bearpaw Outfitters runs guided hunting and fishing trips in Western states, said the legislation counters ""an overreaction in wanting to ban lead."" 
The emotion runs almost as deep as anger from opponents of energy-saving light bulbs now crowding out old-fashioned incandescent bulbs. Republicans also addressed this in the budget bill by banning the Obama administration's ""onerous light bulb standard."" 
The federal law passed in 2007 does not ban incandescent light bulbs, but it does require them to be made more energy-efficient in a phased process through 2020. 
Meanwhile, anglers and hunters watched intently as Congress fought over whether to fund continued government operations and programs ranging from space exploration to soybean supports. 
City slickers like Democratic Senator Charles Schumer, who grew up in Brooklyn, are tracking the legislation as well. 

""One of my great trips is to go for small-mouth bass in Lake Ontario every summer,"" Schumer observed, deftly deflecting the fight over getting the lead out.

Michele Dunne, a former diplomat once posted to Cairo and a senior associate at the Washington, D.C.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said she was given no reason when she was turned back at Cairo International Airport. 
""I come into the country two to four times a year, for the past 10 years at least,"" Dunne told Reuters from Frankfurt's airport, where she was waiting for a flight to return to the United States after leaving Cairo Saturday morning. 
A foreign ministry spokesperson declined to comment and referred questions to the interior ministry. Calls to the ministry and its spokesperson were not answered. 
Dunne, who served in the U.S. foreign service for 17 years, including a posting at the U.S. embassy in Cairo, was coming to Egypt for a conference of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs, she said. 
""I write about Egypt frequently ... I don't think there's been anything really different on my part. It seems to me the change is more on the Egyptian side. It seems the tolerance for any kind of writing that is critical is much less than it was before,"" Dunne said. 
Dunne authored an article published Dec. 2 that highlighted challenges facing human rights organizations in Egypt and other Arab countries. 
Under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the former army chief who ousted elected Islamist President Mohamed Mursi last summer, Egypt's government has pushed non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to register under a Hosni Mubarak-era law. 
Human rights groups say the push to enforce the old law aims to restrict their activities and funding, raising concerns that Sisi's government is rolling back freedoms won in the 2011 uprising that ousted Mubarak. 
""We are deeply disappointed by the Egyptian government's action, which undermines the important need for open dialogue about the difficult challenges Egypt faces today and further isolates Egypt from the international community,"" said Marwan Muasher, vice president for Carnegie's Middle East program. 
The statement that included Muasher's comments added that it was the first time a Carnegie scholar had been denied entry into Egypt.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - (State Department corrects timing of Kerry-Lavrov meeting to Sunday from Monday, paragraph 13) 
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday the United States was seeking to defuse tensions over proposed U.N. resolutions to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during talks in Europe next week. 
Kerry will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Rome on Monday and senior European officials to discuss possible resolutions, which would require a vote in the U.N. Security Council where the United States holds a veto. 
""We're trying to figure out a way to help defuse the tensions and reduce the potential for more conflict and we're exploring various possibilities to that end,"" Kerry told reporters in Bogota when asked whether there is a resolution the U.S. could support. 
Jordan has circulated a Palestinian resolution to the 15-member council calling for Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory to end by November 2016. Western diplomats have said the proposal is ""unbalanced."" France, Britain and Germany are in the process of drafting a proposal. 
""There are a lot of different folks pushing in different directions out there, and the question is can we all pull in the same direction,"" Kerry said. ""That's what we're looking at."" 
Some countries believe agreement on a resolution would be easier to achieve before Israeli elections in March. 
If the United States pushes the Europeans to wait until after Israel's elections, the Jordanians could put forward the Palestinian-drafted resolution for a vote in January that is likely to be vetoed by Washington. 
Jordan's U.N. Ambassador Dina Kawar said this month that she hoped a resolution could be put to a vote in December or January. 
""Waiting until April and therefore probably facing a Palestinian draft in the Security Council in January, vetoed by the Americans, will just make the situation worse,"" said a senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
""If there is a window of opportunity for a consensus resolution it might be this month,"" the diplomat said. 
Kerry met French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius on the sidelines of a climate conference in Peru on Thursday to talk about a European proposal.

76,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2014 10:51AM ET</span>",Senate aims to vote Monday on $1.1 trillion spending bill,"By Richard Cowan and David Lawder 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Friday struggled to pass a $1.1 trillion spending bill that would avert a looming federal government shutdown, postponing a vote until Monday when procedural hurdles begin to evaporate. 
Negotiations between Democrats and Republicans to speed the process along collapsed during late-night talks in the nearly abandoned U.S. Capitol. 
Barring any agreement to act in a more streamlined way, the Senate is on track to hold a procedural vote at 1 a.m. eastern time Sunday aimed at clearing the way for passage on Monday. 
The breakdown in talks capped a week in which passage of the massive spending bill to fund most of the government through Sept. 30, 2015, advanced in fits and starts. 
 Some senators, angered over the bill's easing of a ""Dodd-Frank"" bank regulation law requirement, wanted a shot at removing the provision. 
But demands from some conservative Republicans for a separate vote on an amendment to immediately defund President Barack Obama's implementation of a recently announced immigration program further stymied the bill's progress on Friday. 
In order to keep federal agencies operating beyond midnight Saturday, when existing funds expire, the Senate is expected to pass sometime Saturday a stop-gap bill to temporarily fund the government through the middle of next week. 
The House of Representatives already passed such a measure anticipating the Senate's inability to finish the broad spending bill this week. 
The 1,603-page spending bill, negotiated by Republican and Democratic appropriators and leaders, narrowly passed the House on Thursday following a battle that exposed fraying unity in Obama's Democratic Party. 
 A revolt over financial provisions by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, long a staunch Obama ally, led to a day of tension on Capitol Hill on Thursday. 
Democrats balked at rolling back part of Dodd-Frank, an early legislative achievement of the Obama administration that was passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis and aimed to rein in risk-taking by Wall Street. Democrats also objected to a provision allowing bigger political donations. 
The Dodd-Frank provision would kill planned restrictions on derivatives trading by large banks, allowing them to continue trading swaps and futures in units that benefit from federal deposit insurance and Federal Reserve loans. 
Democrats, aware of the need for unity when Republicans take full control of Congress next year after their midterm election gains, tried to tamp down speculation of a lasting split between Obama and Pelosi. One leadership aide said Pelosi had fired a warning shot to Republicans that House Democrats would fight hard in the new year. 
Reid opened Friday's debate on the bill urging quick passage. ""Since 2011 we have lurched from crisis to crisis with the country constantly under the threat of shutdown or financial catastrophe,"" he said. 
McConnell was also anxious to avoid another unpopular government shutdown as the Republicans head toward taking control of the Senate after the November elections that also gave them a larger House majority. 
PLAYING DOWN THE DIVIDE 
Democrats seeking to play down the Pelosi-Obama divide noted that the two actually were in agreement that the Dodd-Frank measure and some other Republican add-ons were objectionable, but differed on stopping the bill because of them. 
While Pelosi put up a spirited fight to kill the add-ons, she stopped short of trying to slay the spending bill late Thursday by demanding ""no"" votes by her Democrats. 
The battle was a warning to Republicans against further erosion of Dodd-Frank or the president's landmark healthcare law, said a House Democratic leadership aide. 
If such challenges arise next year, Pelosi said, ""Should the president threaten a veto, the votes will be here in the House to sustain it."" 
Democratic fervor against the Dodd-Frank provision was stirred up in part by Senator Elizabeth Warren, viewed as a possible 2016 presidential candidate. 
In a Senate floor speech Friday, she singled out Citigroup's ""influence"" on the U.S. political process. 
""Let me say this to anyone who is listening at Citi: I agree with you. Dodd-Frank isn't perfect. It should have broken you into pieces."" 
Another possible presidential aspirant, Republican Senator Ted Cruz, delivered a fiery speech late on Friday to rally opposition to Obama's immigration reforms. 
 In the 219-206 House vote, 67 Republicans rejected the spending bill, largely because it failed to take action to stop Obama's immigration order. But that was offset by 57 Democrats who voted in favor. 

The spending bill would fund all government agencies through September 2015, except for the Department of Homeland Security, which would get an extension only through Feb. 27. That is the department mainly in charge of implementing the order announced by Obama last month.

77,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2014 09:28AM ET</span>",Drone downer: Will new FAA rules ground recreational fliers?,"By Alwyn Scott 
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Americans shopping for toy remote-controlled airplanes or helicopters may find, sometime in the near future, that they come with unexpected accessories: A raft of new regulations. 
The Federal Aviation Administration, by the end of the month, is expected to propose new rules governing small unmanned aircraft systems, the first major overhaul of its drone policy. 
The agency is closely guarding details, saying only that the rules will cover a wide range of users flying aircraft or drones weighing 55 pounds or less. 
But legal and policy experts who have advised the FAA and lobbied on drone regulations said they predict the new regulations will include restrictions on hundreds of thousands of people who fly quad-copters or toy planes in parks or backyards. 
The focus on toy aircraft is a new twist. Such regulations have been in the works for years, largely because of pressure from businesses wanting to use drones for tasks such as aerial photography. 
Experts said that based on existing drone guidelines, the new FAA rules, expected to take at least a year to kick in, will likely require, among other things, recreational fliers to either join a community-based model aircraft organization - or obtain authorization from the FAA. The rules also could place other restrictions on people who fly drones recklessly, the experts said. If the rules omit discussion of recreational fliers, the experts added, that could sow confusion on what type of flying is allowed. 
""There's basically going to be two options,"" said Richard Hanson, director of government affairs at the Academy of Model Aeronautics, who has lobbied Congress and advised the FAA on drone regulations. ""You either participate in a community-based organization or you have to follow the rules as if you are commercial operator."" 
RISKY FLIERS 
Bona-fide hobbyists have gotten little attention, largely because Congress in 2012 exempted them from new FAA rules - provided they adhere to, among other things, the safety code of a community-based organization, such as AMA, which has more than 170,000 members. 
But that carve-out doesn't apply to an estimated 300,000 people in the U.S. who have bought toy aircraft and are largely unaware of hobbyist association safety codes. 
These casual fliers, including people who get a toy drone as a holiday gift, are blamed for dangerous flights near airports, stadiums and military bases. The FAA recently documented more than 190 close calls, including instances of drones flying within 50 feet of jetliners landing in New York and elsewhere. 
""Unfortunately, there are lots of people who've bought these things at the local store or online who don't know anything about the AMA or its safety guidelines,"" said Ted Ellett, a former FAA chief counsel and head of the unmanned aircraft systems group at law firm Hogan Lovells in Washington, D.C. 
In the absence of rules, the FAA has largely relied on local and state police to prosecute risky drone fliers. 
GOING SOFT? 
Experts say it makes little sense for the FAA to be softer on hobbyists than on commercial fliers, who have an interest in flying responsibly to avoid lawsuits and protect their brands. 
""Drone technology is far surpassing the flying skills of the people who have them,"" said Paul Fraidenburgh, an aviation lawyer at Buchalter Nemer in Irvine, California. ""The fact that someone is receiving money makes me feel safer about their operation."" 
Ellett, the former FAA chief counsel, said the FAA should issue clear definitions for flights that are exempt from the new rules - and those that are not. Otherwise, he added, confusion will be the order of the day. 
The AMA has lobbied for the hobbyist exemption, arguing its members have an 80-year history of safe piloting, even with planes that are fitted with jet engines and can zoom at 200 miles an hour, the AMA's Hanson said. Those enthusiasts are not the toy-flying amateurs who order a quad-copter from Amazon.com Inc that experts expect the FAA's new rule to address. 
Hanson served on an FAA advisory group that recommended light regulation for drones weighing a pound or two but would ratchet up requirements for flying aircraft of greater size and power. He said his understanding of current FAA policy suggests the agency won't provide that kind of stepped regulation. 
The AMA's safety code covers items the FAA has said should apply to hobbyists: not flying carelessly or recklessly, avoiding prohibited areas, staying below 400 feet, keeping clear of manned aircraft and not ""flying directly over unprotected people."" The AMA's $58 annual membership fee includes $2.5 million in liability insurance. 

The FAA said at a congressional hearing on Wednesday it is trying to educate recreational fliers about safe flight, recognizing that final rules are at least a year away. In the same vein, Amazon has linked its online ""drone store"" to the AMA, the FAA and other sites with safety information.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has decided not to force a New York Times reporter to divulge the identity of a confidential source for a book that detailed a failed CIA effort to undermine Iran's nuclear weapons program, a person familiar with the decision said on Friday. 
Federal prosecutors had wanted James Risen's testimony because they think information in his 2006 book ""State of War"" was leaked by former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling, who is facing trial. In 2010, Sterling was indicted on 10 charges relating to Risen's book, including unauthorized retention and communication of national defense information. 
The source, who is not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said Holder has ruled out forcing Risen to disclose his contact but has not made a final decision on whether the Justice Department may ask Risen to testify in Sterling's trial on several other questions. 
A federal judge has given the Justice Department until next Tuesday to make a decision on its efforts to force Risen to testify. 
Representatives for the New York Times and Risen could not immediately be reached for comment. 
In June, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an appeal filed by Risen, leaving intact a July 2013 ruling by the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that said Risen must testify. The appeals court ruled that there is no ""reporter's privilege"" under the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech, meaning journalists do not receive special treatment. 

Holder earlier this year told a group of media executives that no reporter would ever be jailed while he is in office for carrying out news gathering duties, according to a Justice Department summary of the meeting.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ashton Carter, President Barack Obama's nominee to replace Chuck Hagel as U.S. defense secretary, has undergone a long-planned surgical procedure on his back ahead of his confirmation process in the Senate, the White House said on Friday. 
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement that the procedure was successful but did not give details about the operation. 
""Mr. Carter decided to go ahead with the previously scheduled procedure so that he could complete it before beginning his confirmation process,"" Earnest added. 
""Mr. Carter is resting comfortably with his family and is looking forward to (the) confirmation process and if confirmed, to serving with the men and women of the Defense Department,"" Earnest said. 
Obama formally nominated Carter, 60, for the Pentagon post on Dec. 5, choosing him for a job that will entail tackling messy wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan and trying to fend off potentially damaging budget cuts. 
If confirmed by the Senate, he would become the fourth defense secretary to serve under Obama. The confirmation process is expected to begin early next year. 
Hagel, who resigned under pressure on Nov. 24, had privately expressed frustration with the Obama administration's strategy on Iraq and Syria and with his lack of influence over the policy, which was driven by the White House.

80,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2014 06:43PM ET</span>","Wall Street scores a win in Washington, eyes more victories ","By Emily Stephenson 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Five years after President Barack Obama slammed Wall Street ""fat cat"" bankers, some of the nation's biggest banks this week successfully lobbied Congress to roll back a hotly debated provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. 
The question is whether bankers can keep up their winning streak. 
The early view is that Wall Street, insurers, and companies that deal in complex financial instruments will secure targeted victories in 2015, especially with Republicans in control of the Senate. 
But Democrats who chafe at the idea of bank handouts will block any measures that could gut Dodd-Frank, one of Obama's signature legislative accomplishments. 
""I don't think Dodd-Frank is, in whole, going anywhere,"" said Tony Fratto, who worked in the Bush White House and now is at Hamilton Place Strategies in Washington. 
Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives included in a $1.1 trillion federal government spending package a provision easing a Dodd-Frank rule that forces Wall Street banks to push out certain swaps trading into isolated units. 
Republicans also attached to a popular terrorism insurance bill a Dodd-Frank provision saying ""end-user"" businesses such as energy companies would not need to post collateral for certain risky trades. 
The Democrat-controlled Senate had not passed either bill on Friday afternoon, but appeared likely to do so. 
Lawmakers also on Wednesday gave the Federal Reserve more flexibility in writing certain requirements for insurance companies such as Prudential Financial (N:PRU). 
These wins would have been unthinkable a few years ago, when Obama pointed to the Occupy Wall Street protests as a sign of Americans' frustrations with the after-effects of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. 
On Thursday night, Obama was forced to lobby indignant Democrats to support the funding bill in spite of the Dodd-Frank rollback provision, even as JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon was also calling Democrats to support the bill. 
""I don't think it's accurate to describe the president and anybody from Wall Street being on the same side of this issue,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Friday, when asked if Obama was more aligned with big banks than House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. 
'FIRST CRACKS' 
Some Republicans on Friday were taking a victory lap. ""Yesterday showed the first cracks in the wall for Dodd-Frank,"" Saat Alety, a spokesman for Republican Representative Ed Royce of California, said about the spending bill. 
Bank lobbyists are taking a more reserved view, saying it will be difficult to overcome Obama's veto power for major blows to Dodd-Frank. ""The battle lines, so to speak, will continue to be drawn,"" said James Ballentine of the American Bankers Association. 
Lobbyists said alterations with bipartisan support or a thumbs-up from regulators could move forward. 
That could include changing the asset threshold at which banks are considered big enough to destabilize markets if they fail. That could provide medium-sized banks such as Regions Financial Corp (N:RF) relief from tough capital rules. 
There is also broad support for changes to the bankruptcy code that would be tailored to banks. Currently, Dodd-Frank lays out a path for unwinding failing banks that Wall Street supports but that Republicans find unworkable. 
Further, Congress may act to exempt small banks from a proprietary trading ban known as the Volcker rule, to change the way mortgage rules treat certain fees, and to give some relief to Wall Street banks' international swaps trades. 
PUSHOUT WARS 
Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren this week said a vote to roll back the swaps push-out provision was ""a vote for future taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street."" 
Others say it's more of a symbolic victory for Wall Street. The swaps push-out provision was a late addition to Dodd-Frank championed by former Democratic Senator Blanche Lincoln, who was in danger of losing her seat. 
The idea behind the measure was that banks such as Citigroup (N:C) and JPMorgan were conducting risky swaps trading in the same units that enjoyed federal backstops, and taxpayers should not be on the hook if trades soured. 
But banks claimed it was more dangerous to push out the activity to less-regulated units. And the provision captures only about 5 percent of banks' derivatives books instead of all swaps trading. 
White House Spokesman Earnest said on Friday there was not consensus about the importance of the push-out provision. 
Robert Holifield, her staff director on the Senate Agriculture Committee, said on Friday that in hindsight, the provision was not the most crucial derivatives section in the law. 

""The important reforms are still very much intact,"" he said.

81,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2014 05:00PM ET</span>",U.S. Congress readies new sanctions on Russia,"By Timothy Gardner 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers were expected on Friday to approve new sanctions on Russian weapons companies and investors in the country's high-tech oil projects, putting more U.S. pressure on President Vladimir Putin for interference in eastern Ukraine. 
Late on Thursday, the Senate and House of Representatives unanimously passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act. A House panel made a small change and sent the bill back to the Senate for a last vote expected as soon as late Friday. 
President Barack Obama has said he opposes further sanctions on Russia unless Europe is on board. 
The bill, which will be sent to Obama to sign, requires him to apply sanctions on Russian state-owned arms exporter Rosoboronexport and other defense companies Congress says contribute to instability in Ukraine, Georgia and Syria. 
It requires Obama to penalize global companies that make large investments in crude oil drilling projects in deep waters and the Arctic. 
The penalties go beyond U.S. and EU sanctions imposed in September on the world's largest oil companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp and BP Plc. 
The legislation would also provide $350 million in military assistance to Ukraine from 2015 to 2017, and other aid for energy to the country, which has been threatened by cutoffs in natural gas supply from Russia. 
Republicans, who control the House and will have a majority in the Senate from January, have criticized Obama's reaction to Russian interference in Ukraine as inadequate. 
""The hesitant U.S. response to Russia's continued invasion of Ukraine threatens to escalate this conflict even further,"" said Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, incoming chairman of the foreign relations committee. 
The unanimous support for the bill showed a ""firm commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty and to making sure Putin pays for his assault on freedom and security in Europe,"" said Corker, who co-authored the bill with Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, the current head of the panel. 
The bill authorizes Obama to penalize the top Russian natural gas producer Gazprom if he determines it is withholding significant natural gas supplies from NATO members or from Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova. Lawmakers dropped a measure that would have designated Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova as non-NATO allies of Washington. 
Obama on Thursday said slapping fresh sanctions on Russia without a similar move by Europe would be counterproductive. 

In Kiev on Friday, Ukraine's defense minister called for a doubling of the military budget to buy weapons abroad and better equip the army to fight Russian-backed separatists in the east.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The next Republican budget will look a lot like those written by exiting House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan, eliminating deficits in 10 years and calling again for a massive revamp of the federal Medicare program, Ryan's replacement said on Friday. 
Representative Tom Price, who takes the reins of the U.S. House budget panel in January, told reporters he will ""build on"" Ryan's proposals by devising ways to put more federal benefits programs under the control of states. 
Ryan will take over as chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. Over the past four years, he used his budgets to articulate a vision for Republican priorities that elevated him to the national political stage, even though none were passed by the Democratic-controlled Senate. 
Ryan's budget last year sought deep cuts to social safety net programs in order to achieve balance by the mid 2020s. 
Price, a physician with four years on the Budget Committee, said a Republican-controlled Congress can now advance policies pioneered by Ryan, including his controversial Medicare plans. 
Those plans would scale back the popular social insurance program for the elderly and disabled by limiting beneficiaries to a set amount of money every year to buy private healthcare insurance. 
Known as ""premium support,"" the program as envisioned by Ryan would mark a dramatic shift from the current Medicare system, under which the federal government helps pay for all medical services that an individual uses. 
""The issue of premium support, internally is now basically settled policy for the Republican conference,"" Price said. 
Republicans argue that this will save Medicare from collapsing as the massive Baby Boom generation retires, but Democrats and President Barack Obama say it would ""gut"" the program and shift a growing healthcare cost burden to seniors. 
One potential way for Republicans to push through such a policy would be to employ a procedural tool that allows certain budget-related bills. 
Known as ""reconciliation,"" the maneuver was last used by Democrats in 2010 when they controlled both House and Senate, to pass Obamacare, President Barack Obama's landmark healthcare reform law. 
Reconciliation can only be used in limited cases. Some Republicans say it should be employed to repeal Obamacare. But Price said his party needs to think hard about whether this might be a wasted effort, because Obama would be certain to veto such legislation. 
""There aren't many opportunities to do a reconciliation piece of legislation, so we want to use it in the wisest manner possible,"" he said. 
Republicans will soon decide whether they would be better off using reconciliation to pass reforms to federal benefits or tax reform, which Obama may be more likely to sign, Price said. 
A March 2015 deadline to extend the federal debt limit would present a ""pinch-point"" to demand more spending cuts, but Price said this did not have to lead to a debt default crisis.

""This is by definition a compromise bill,"" Obama told reporters as he met senior aides to discuss the U.S. fight against the Ebola virus. ""This is what's produced when you have the divided government that the American people voted for."" 
In the negotiations, Obama found himself at odds with a key Democratic loyalist in Congress, Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives. 
Pelosi wanted pulled out of the legislation a provision that weakens some of the Wall Street reforms that Obama engineered after the 2008-09 financial meltdown. While Obama opposed the Wall Street reform provision as well, he did not actively fight to get it excluded to avoid disrupting the compromise talks. 
""There are a couple provisions in this bill that I really do not like,"" Obama said. On the other hand, he said, it includes funding needed for his signature healthcare law, fighting climate change, expanding early childhood education and confronting the Ebola virus. 
""Had I been able to draft my own legislation, get it passed without any Republican votes, I suspect it would be slightly different,"" Obama said. ""That is not the circumstance we find ourselves in and I think what the American people very much are looking for is responsible governance and the willingness to compromise."" 
At his daily news briefing, White House spokesman Josh Earnest sought to mend fences with Pelosi after the strains that emerged between her and Obama on Thursday. He said none of the central legislative achievements of the Obama presidency could have been done without Pelosi's help. 
""The president is confident that the strong working relationship and the effective, productive working relationship that we have had over the last six years will continue for the next two,"" said Earnest, referring to the end of Obama's tenure. 
Obama said the $1.01 trillion legislation that passed the House of Representatives and appeared headed toward approval by the Senate contains funds necessary for the fight against Ebola. 

""We've got to stay on this,"" he said of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. ""This is not a fight that is going to go away any time soon.""

85,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2014 04:10AM ET</span>",China expresses regret at U.S. failure to pass IMF reforms,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China expressed regret on Friday at the failure of U.S. Congress to pass reforms to give emerging markets greater say at the International Monetary Fund. 
The White House signed off on the reforms in 2010, but U.S. lawmakers need to back changes in how the IMF is funded before they can be put into place, given Washington's position as a controlling shareholder in the global lender. 
But a must-pass $1.1 trillion U.S. spending bill unveiled late on Tuesday omits the IMF voting reform provision, dooming prospects that it will get passed by a year-end deadline. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said that passing the reforms concerned the ""reputation, electiveness and legality"" of the IMF. 
""China will continue to urge the U.S. Congress to approve it,"" Hong told a daily news briefing. 
Finance chiefs from around the world had given the United States until Jan. 1 to ratify the reforms, and have threatened to move forward without it if it fails to do so. 
The changes would double the fund's resources and hand more IMF voting power to countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, also known as BRICS. It would also revamp the IMF's board to reduce dominance of Western Europe. 
Some outside observers believe the lack of reforms was the impetus behind the decision of the BRICS nations to launch their own currency reserve pool and development bank earlier this year, intended as a challenge to Western dominance in global financial institutions. 

China also launched a proposed $50 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, seen as a direct rival to the Western-dominated World Bank and Asian Development Bank.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House of Representatives averted a government shutdown on Thursday, narrowly passing a $1.1 trillion spending bill despite strenuous Democratic objections to controversial financial provisions.
The vote followed a long day of drama and discord on Capitol Hill that highlighted fraying Democratic unity and featured an uneasy alliance between President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, enemies in past budget battles but on the same side this time in pushing for passage.
A vote on the measure was delayed for hours after Democrats revolted against provisions to roll back part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and allow more big money political donations, while conservative Republicans objected because the measure did not block funds for Obama's immigration order.
Democrats said Republican leaders, flexing their new political muscle after big wins in the midterm elections that will give them control of both chambers of Congress next year, had gone too far in trying to roll back Dodd-Frank.
""We have enough votes to show them never to do this again,"" Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi told members of her party, behind closed doors, according to a source in the room.
Some Democrats also demanded the removal of a provision that allows a massive increase in individual contributions to national political parties for federal elections, potentially up to $777,600 a year.
The debate pitted Obama against Pelosi, one of his most loyal allies in Congress, as Obama and his administration waged a last-ditch campaign to persuade Democrats to set aside their objections, arguing that if it failed, the party would get a worse spending deal next year under Republican control.
The effort to save the bill angered some Democrats, who complained that both Obama and JPMorgan Chase & Co chief executive Jamie Dimon were calling Democrats to support it.
""It is very strange, very strange that the two of them would be working for the support of this bill,"" said Representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee.
In the 219-206 vote, 67 Republicans rejected the spending bill, largely because it failed to take action to stop Obama's executive immigration order. But that was offset by 57 Democrats who voted in favor.
Shortly after passage, both the House and Senate passed a 48-hour extension to allow the Senate more time to consider the measure. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said it would be debated on Friday.
The 1,603-page bill, negotiated by Republican and Democratic appropriators and leaders, drew Democrats' ire when they discovered it would roll back the Dodd-Frank law due to go into effect next year by killing planned restrictions on derivatives trading by large banks, allowing them to continue trading swaps and futures in units that benefit from federal deposit insurance and Federal Reserve loans.
If passed by the Senate, the spending bill would fund all government agencies through September 2015, except for the Department of Homeland Security, which would get an extension only through Feb. 27. Republicans intend to deny funding to the agency to carry out Obama's order allowing millions of undocumented immigrants to stay and work in the United States.

The measure keeps domestic spending largely flat, while providing billions of dollars in additional funds to fight Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

88,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2014 07:20PM ET</span>",Psychologist who helped devise CIA interrogation program lost Mormon role,"SPOKANE, Wa. (Reuters) - One of the chief architects of the CIA's harsh interrogation program said on Thursday he had to quit as leader of his Mormon church in 2012 amid controversy about his role in fighting terrorism. 
No senior policymakers or CIA officials have been charged for the maltreatment of suspects, but at least for former Air Force psychologist Bruce Jessen there has been a repercussion at a local level for his part in the so-called ""war on terror."" 
Jessen resigned as bishop of a Mormon congregation in Spokane, Washington after civil liberties and human rights activists criticized his professional past in the local newspaper. 
""I just felt it would be unfair for me to bring that controversy to a lot of other people, so I decided to step down,"" Jessen told Reuters outside his home south of Spokane. 
The CIA paid $80 million to a company run by Jessen and another former Air Force psychologist, James Mitchell, according to a U.S. Senate report released this week. The report said the pair recommended waterboarding, slaps to the face and mock burial for prisoners suspected of being terrorists. 
The pair are referred to by pseudonyms in the report but intelligence sources have identified them by name. Mitchell said earlier this week the report was a ""bunch of hooey."" Jessen said a nondisclosure agreement prevented him from commenting. 
""It's a difficult position to be in,"" he said. ""You want to set the record straight."" He accused the media of publishing ""distortions"" about CIA interrogation methods. 
Jessen, 65, had only spent a week in the role as head of his 300-member Spokane congregation when he stepped down in October, 2012. 
""This was due to concerns expressed about his past work related to interrogation techniques,"" said Eric Hawkins, a national spokesman in Salt Lake City for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as the Mormon faith is formally known.  
The position of bishop is unpaid and part-time but well-respected in the Mormon world. 
""Local leaders met with Jessen and together determined that it would be difficult for him to serve as an effective leader in that position,"" Hawkins said. 
A bishop normally serves three to six years, he added. Jessen remains a member of the same congregation. 
    The American Psychological Association – to which Jessen and Mitchell do not belong and are thus not subject to discipline - has called for the pair to be held accountable. But U.S. officials say there will be no criminal charges.

Senator Carl Levin released a newly declassified section of a March 11, 2003 cable that undercut administration statements that Mohammed Atta and Iraqi agent Ahmad al-Anian had met in the Czech capital in April 2001. 
"" (T)here is not one [U.S. counter terrorism] or FBI expert that ... has said they have evidence or 'know' that (Atta) was indeed [in Prague]. In fact the analysis has been quite the opposite,"" said the cable, made available by Levin, retiring chairman of the Armed Services Committee. 
President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney had earlier linked Iraq with al Qaeda and international terrorism and, incorrectly, said it was in possession of weapons of mass destruction, justifying the March 20, 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. 
Levin said a recent memoir published by Jiri Ruzek, head of Czech counterintelligence in 2001, described the story about Atta's Prague meeting as a single-source rumor and said the Bush administration pressured officials in Prague to confirm it. 
Levin urged CIA Director John Brennan to release the entire March 2003 cable.

90,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2014 06:20PM ET</span>",CIA chief admits agency used 'abhorrent' methods on detainees,"By Mark Hosenball 
LANGLEY, Va. (Reuters) - CIA Director John Brennan said on Thursday some agency officers used ""abhorrent"" methods on detainees captured following the Sept. 11 attacks and said it was ""unknowable"" whether harsh interrogation techniques yielded useful intelligence. 
With his agency under fire in the aftermath of a U.S. Senate report detailing the CIA's use of torture on detainees after the 2001 attacks, Brennan rejected the report's conclusion that the agency had deceived the White House, Congress and the public about its interrogation program. 
""Our reviews indicate that the detention and interrogation program produced useful intelligence that helped the United States thwart attack plans, capture terrorists and save lives,"" Brennan told a news conference at the agency's Virginia headquarters. 
""But let me be clear. We have not concluded that it was the use of EITs (enhanced interrogation techniques) within that program that allowed us to obtain useful information from detainees subjected to them,"" Brennan said. 
""The cause-and-effect relationship between the use of EITs and useful information subsequently provided by the detainee is, in my view, unknowable,"" he added. 
The program was run under President George W. Bush. Senior officials from that administration have defended the methods, which President Barack Obama barred when he took office in 2009. Former Vice President Dick Cheney said in 2009 the methods were ""absolutely essential in saving thousands of American lives and preventing further attacks against the United States."" 
Brennan made an appeal to move on from the controversy over past CIA actions. 
""We know we have room to improve,"" Brennan said. 
""In light of the fact that these techniques were abandoned seven years ago, however, my fervent hope is that we can put aside this debate and move forward to focus on issues that are relevant to our current national security challenges,"" he added. 
The Intelligence Committee's report found that the CIA acted more brutally and pervasively than it has acknowledged. 
Some captives were deprived of sleep for up to 180 hours, at times with their hands shackled above their heads, and the report recorded cases of simulated drowning, or ""waterboarding,"" and sexual abuse, including ""rectal feeding"" or ""rectal hydration"" without any documented medical need. 
""In a limited number of cases, agency officers used interrogation techniques that had not been authorized, were abhorrent and rightly should be repudiated by all. And we fell short when it came to holding some officers accountable for their mistakes,"" Brennan said. 
Brennan said the ""overwhelming majority of officers involved in the program at CIA carried out their responsibilities faithfully and in accordance with the legal and policy guidance they were provided."" 
The Senate committee concluded that CIA, through torturing al Qaeda and other captives in secret prisons worldwide between 2002 and 2006, did not obtain information it could have gotten through non-coercive means enabling it to disrupt a single al Qaeda plot. 
CHAIN OF COMMAND 
Brennan was a senior CIA official when the interrogation program was put in place. He acknowledged he had some knowledge of the agency's involvement in harsh interrogations and running secret prisons. ""I was not in the chain of command. I did not have authority over the implementation of that program or the management oversight of it,"" he said. 
Brennan said the CIA believes information from detainees subjected to enhanced interrogation eventually helped the United States track down al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, killed in a 2011 U.S. raid in Pakistan. Brennan conceded it was uncertain whether the same intelligence could have been obtained without such methods. 
Brennan said that non-coercive methods are available to elicit useful information from detainees that will not impact national security or international standing. 
Asked whether he considered some of the methods used by CIA interrogators to be torture, Brennan said he would leave it to others to place labels on what occurred. 
Brennan noted that the CIA was directed by Bush to carry out a program to detain terrorism suspects around the world after the 2001 attacks. ""We were not prepared,"" Brennan said. 
Brennan said he believes the use of ""coercive methods has a strong prospect for resulting in false information"" because the detainee may say anything simply to get the methods to stop. He noted the CIA maintains the methods yielded both ""useful"" and ""false"" information.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior Republican in the U.S. Senate plans to revive legislation early in 2015 that would raise the cap for temporary work visas for programmers, engineers and high-skilled workers. 
Utah Senator Orrin Hatch said his tech-focused bill could be a way for lawmakers to start to make progress on the polarizing issue of immigration reform. 
Hatch's Immigration Innovation Act, I-Squared for short, would address chronic shortages of temporary visas used by the technology industry to fill jobs that they argue go unfilled because of a lack of qualified Americans. 
""If we can do I-Squared, I think it would open the door to real, decent, honorable immigration reform itself,"" Hatch said in a telephone interview. 
Republicans were enraged when President Barack Obama used his executive powers last month to lift the threat of deportation for as many as 4.7 million undocumented immigrants. 
Obama said he was forced to act because Congress had failed to pass comprehensive immigration reforms. 
Republicans will control both the Senate and House of Representatives in the new year. They have said they will try to undo some of Obama's measures. 
But Hatch said he saw common ground between Republicans and Democrats for moving ahead on reforms for high-skilled visas, a more targeted approach than the broad comprehensive bill that the Senate passed last year, but the House failed to adopt. 
""For too long, we've said 'Comprehensive or nothing,'"" Hatch said in a telephone interview. 
Hatch represents the tech-rich ""Silicon Slopes"" state of Utah, and regularly talks to tech moguls. This month, for instance, he met with Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella and Apple CEO Tim Cook. 
Hatch's bill was first introduced last year with Republican Marco Rubio and Democrats Amy Klobuchar and Chris Coons. The measures became part of the Senate's comprehensive bill. 
Tech companies have been strong supporters of the comprehensive approach. But if they threw their heft behind his stand-alone bill, Hatch said it would pass. 
""I think they need to call in the chips and say, 'OK: you said you're for us. Now prove it,'"" Hatch said. 
The path in the Senate will not be easy. The bill would need to attract enough support from Democrats to pass the 60-vote threshold. 
Hatch said he expects his bill would face amendments from both sides of the aisle, but ultimately would pass. 
""I think virtually every Republican would vote for this, and I suspect that we'll get a considerable number of Democrats too,"" he said.

92,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2014 04:09PM ET</span>","Italy, Turkey to service F-35 jet, engine in Europe: Pentagon","By Andrea Shalal 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Thursday said Italy and Turkey would provide initial heavy maintenance of Lockheed Martin Corp's new F-35 fighter jet and its engine in Europe from 2018, paving the way for billions of dollars in work by companies there. 
The move reflects the growing maturity of the $399 billion weapons program, with over 120 jets already produced and U.S. and foreign militaries gearing up to start operating the jets around the world in coming years. 
Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan, the Pentagon's F-35 program manager, said the decisions came after months of reviews and site visits, and were based on ""best value"" and other factors such as location and projected F-35 basing. 
Bogdan said Italy would do initial heavy maintenance of the jets, with Britain providing backup if needed. He said that might be the case if Italy's F-35 production facility was needed to build more jets than currently planned. 
Heavy maintenance of the F135 engines that power the supersonic F-35 would be done in Turkey, but Norway and the Netherlands would also set up sites in two to three years, given the high cost of equipment required for testing, he said. 
The engines are built by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. 
Bogdan told reporters the U.S. military had already begun work at sites for servicing the jets and engines in the United States, and would announce sites in Asia next week. Next year, he said U.S. officials would look at other elements involved in servicing a global fleet of jets that could reach 3,100 jets. 
Bogdan underscored that other countries buying the jet could bid for that additional maintenance work in coming years. 
The total value of maintenance work on the new warplanes could amount to ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" over the next 50 years, Bogdan said, given Pentagon estimates that it will cost the U.S. military over $1 trillion to operate and maintain the 2,457 jets that it plans to buy over that time. 
Lockheed is developing three variants of the F-35 for the U.S. military and eight partners that helped fund its development: Britain, Australia, Italy, Norway, Turkey, the Netherlands, Denmark and Canada. Israel, Japan and South Korea have also placed orders for the planes. 
The Marine Corps plans to start initial combat use of the planes in July 2015, with the Air Force following suit in 2016. 
In Italy, much of the work will be done by Alenia, a unit of Finmeccanica SpA, which manages a $1 billion-plus government-owned final assembly and checkout facility in Cameri that is also building wings for F-35 jets. 
The news provided a boost for the government of Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, and cements Italy's commitment to the F-35 program. It comes at a time when some Italian lawmakers have suggested further reducing their country's F-35 orders, which were already whittled back to 90 jets from 131 several years ago. 
John Phillips, the U.S. ambassador to Italy, told reporters in Rome that the decision would ""provide a very substantial economic benefit for Italy for decades into the future."" 
Mauro Moretti, Finmeccanica CEO, said the work would result in a large number of jobs and other economic benefits. He said the firm was also vying for F-35 avionics and other components. 
Norway also welcomed the news and said the work in its country would be done by AIM Norway, a privately held firm. 
In Turkey, the work is likely to be done by Turkish Aerospace Industries, sources familiar with the matter said. 

No comments were immediately available from Britain or the Netherlands.

93,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2014 02:30PM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers give preview of coming oil export fight,"By Timothy Gardner 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers gave a preview on Thursday of a looming fight next year on lifting the ban on crude exports with supporters saying it would sustain the drilling boom and others questioning its impacts on industry and fuel prices. 
In a House of Representatives hearing on the ban, Texas Republican Joe Barton said exporting oil would boost the economy, lower gas prices, and help give allies alternative oil supplies to Russia. 
By some measures the United States is the world's top oil producer and Barton said the country should use that power. 
""When you're number one, you use that status,"" said Barton, who introduced a short, 1.5 page bill this week to lift the ban Congress passed in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo. 
The U.S. drilling boom of the last five or six years has led to a glut of light crude many oil refiners, who paid dearly to retool plants to run heavy crude, are unable to easily process. 
Barton's fellow Republican, Lisa Murkowski, an Alaskan and the incoming Senate energy chairman, and Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, are big supporters of removing the ban. They face an uphill battle in both Houses of Congress in getting widespread support. 
Many lawmakers from states with economies that are heavily dependent on energy are concerned they could see higher costs from U.S. oil exports. Barton's fellow Republicans Representatives John Shimkus, and David McKinley of West Virginia, and Joseph Pitts of Pennsylvania, questioned the panel of oil market experts at the hearing on how industry would be affected by lifting the ban. 
Pitts asked Adam Sieminski, head of the U.S. Energy Information Administration, if there was a guarantee lifting the ban would remove volatility in gasoline prices. Sieminski said there was a chance U.S. oil exports could cause global crude prices to rise temporarily if they caused unrest in an oil producing nation. 
He stressed that U.S. gasoline prices are mostly based on global Brent crude prices, which many analysts say should fall in the long term if the U.S. ban is lifted. 
Shimkus said he has ""tons of questions"" about removing the ban. 
As pressure builds to lift the trade restriction, the U.S. Department of Commerce has told at least three companies that they can export a minimally-processed light crude called condensate. 
Oil producers want the Obama administration to allow all condensate to be exported as a first step in removing the ban. There are no signs this will happen soon. 
U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman has said the administration is looking at the oil export issue but there have been no policy changes. Froman told CNBC on Thursday the domestic oil boom has helped draw more investment to the United States and made it ""a place where companies want to put their factories both to serve the U.S. market but also to export (products) all over the world.""  
Murkowski has said she will introduce legislation, perhaps next year, to lift the ban if the administration does not take action.

Obama said he was also confident the administration could make a ""strong case"" in Congress for a Trans-Pacific Partnership deal covering nearly 40 percent of the world economy. 
""I'm much more optimistic about us being able to close out an agreement with our TPP partners than I was last year,"" he said at a meeting of the President's Export Council. 
""It doesn't mean it's a done deal, but I think the odds of us being able to get a strong agreement are significantly higher than 50-50."" 
A senior Chilean official said last week the talks should be finalized in the first quarter of 2015. Any agreement would need to be ratified by the U.S. Congress. 
Countries had hoped to wind the deal up last year, but the United States and Japan have been in a stalemate over market access for U.S. farm exports. 
Obama said the administration would work with Congress to approve fast-track authority, which limits lawmakers to a yes-or-no vote on trade deals in exchange for setting negotiating objectives. He did not give details on timing. 
Some lawmakers in Obama's own Democratic party oppose fast-track, worried about the impact of trade on jobs. Also, some conservative Republicans oppose fast-track, saying it delegates too much power to the White House. 
But many trade experts expect Republican victories in mid-term elections will give trade bills an easier ride through Congress from next year. 
""The dynamics really don't change in terms of the number of votes in the House and the Senate that are there to be gotten for a good trade deal but we have to make the case and I think we can make a very strong case,"" Obama said. 
One focus of criticism has been proposals allowing companies to take cross-border legal action against governments, for example over laws aimed at limiting smoking. 
Obama said U.S. companies should comply with local public health and safety rules but those should not be discriminatory or used as a ""ruse"" to keep investors out. 

""Those are issues that I think can be negotiated,"" he said.

96,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2014 01:50PM ET</span>",Lawyer fears abuse of U.S. detainees transferred to Afghan custody,"By Frank Jack Daniel 
KABUL (Reuters) - The final few inmates of U.S.-run prisons near Kabul, scenes of abuse highlighted by a U.S. Senate report this week, are now in an Afghan detention system with its own grisly record of torture, their lawyer said on Thursday. 
But the government in Kabul vowed they would be safe and not mistreated. 
Afghan security forces, including the army that runs the detention facility where the foreign inmates are believed to be held, regularly engage in torture of conflict-related detainees, several reports by the United Nations and rights groups say. 
The International Criminal Court (ICC) said on Dec. 2 that common Afghan interrogation techniques included beatings, suspension by the wrists or ankles, electric shocks, twisting and wrenching of the genitals and burning with cigarettes. 
According to the Senate report, two Tunisian inmates transferred to Afghan custody this week suffered harsh treatment while in a CIA prison in Afghanistan 12 years ago and have been held in different U.S. facilities ever since. 
They are now believed to be at a large detention centre that was formerly part of the U.S.-run Bagram facility. 
A lawyer representing the two, Redah al Najar and Lufti al Gharisi, said they had wanted to return to their home country rather than be transferred to an Afghan prison. 
""We are extremely concerned about our clients who have been handed over to the Afghan authorities,"" said Tina Foster, a New York-based lawyer. ""They face a very real risk of being tortured, again."" 
REPATRIATION MAY COME SOON 
Al Najar was picked up in Pakistan in May, 2002 and the U.S. government suspects him of being a former bodyguard to Osama Bin Laden. Like other suspects picked up on battlefields around the world in the U.S. ""war on terror"", al Najar was never charged. 
The office of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said fears about the treatment of the detainees were unfounded. 
Spokesman Nazifullah Salarzai said they would not face torture and that the government was committed to weeding out any cases of abuse of prisoners. 
""We hear about these things, and we do seek assessment from our independent human rights commission, and we are strongly committed to eliminating any abuse or mistreatment in case it exists,"" Salarzai said. 
A senior government official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, said he expected the inmates to be transferred to their home countries fairly soon. 
""We stand ready to help the Afghans repatriate or resettle our clients,"" Foster said. 
""We are hopeful that the Afghans will act more responsibly than the Americans and allow us to assist our clients so they can finally get home to their families or to safe third countries."" 
""DISAPPEARED"" 
Adding to her concerns, Foster said she had no idea of the whereabouts of four other clients she believed were being held at Bagram when it closed on Dec. 10, the day after the U.S. Senate report. 
The U.S. government said the timing was linked to an agreement with Afghanistan, not the report. 
""The (U.S.) government's lawyers claim to have no information at this point.  This is the second time the U.S. government has 'disappeared' our clients."" 
The U.S. military said it had just three detainees in custody in Afghanistan on Dec. 9. Two were sent to Afghan custody ""for potential prosecution."" 
One was released and will be resettled with the assistance of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said Myles B Caggins III, a Pentagon spokesman for detainee policy. He said the transfers were consistent with U.S. security requirements and humane treatment policy. 
Rights groups say torture in detention was common in Afghanistan before the U.S.-led war on the Taliban that followed the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, and that it remains engrained in Afghan forces trained and funded by the U.S. government. 
The ICC singled out the national intelligence agency as the worst offender, but said there were also credible allegations of abuse by local police and the army.

Representative Dave Camp, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed the bill at the 11th hour in the midst of Congress' scramble to keep the federal government funded and open. Camp is set to retire within weeks. 
The $11 billion bill dealt with tax breaks for donating property for conservation, for donating food inventories, and for making distributions from retirement plans to charities. 
Camp called for making the trio of tax breaks permanent. At present, they are part of a package of dozens of temporary tax laws that Congress routinely renews every year or two. 
By a vote of 275-149, the House declined to approve the bill, which failed to gain the two-thirds majority needed under an expedited voting procedure. 
Democrats had criticized the bill because it offered no new sources of tax revenue to offset the drain on the federal budget that making the tax breaks permanent would impose. The White House had also expressed opposition to the measure. 
The Republican-controlled House last week voted to renew all 55 of the temporary tax provisions, known as the extenders, postponing further debate on them until 2015. The Democratic-controlled Senate has not voted on the extenders renewal, but its approval was widely expected. 
The renewal by the House of the extenders, most of which expired at the end of 2013, was retroactive to Jan. 1, 2014, meaning taxpayers could claim the tax breaks for the 2014 tax year, including the three charitable giving provisions.

98,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2014 12:50PM ET</span>",Shutdown deadline looms as opposition to U.S. spending bill mounts,"By David Lawder 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With the threat looming of a midnight government shutdown, the fate of a $1.1 trillion U.S. spending bill was thrust into doubt on Thursday by Democratic objections over a provision to roll back part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. 
A vote on final passage of the bill was set for Thursday afternoon, and House Speaker John Boehner predicted passage. 
But the measure barely cleared a procedural hurdle as both liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans urged their colleagues to oppose it. 
Current spending authority for federal agencies expires at midnight on Thursday, so the House is also planning to pass a two-day extension to avoid a shutdown and allow more time for Senate passage, the Republican aides said. 
The 1,603-page funding package, negotiated by Republican and Democratic appropriators and leaders in both chambers, looked to be cruising toward passage until full details were disclosed on Tuesday night. 
Liberals, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, were livid that it included a provision that kills planned restrictions on derivatives trading by large banks, allowing them to continue trading swaps and futures in units that benefit from federal deposit insurance and Federal Reserve loans. 
The Obama administration views the restriction, due to go into effect next year, as a pillar of the financial reforms enacted after the financial crisis, which was triggered by a collapse in complex mortgage derivatives. 
""We think that's wrong"" Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told CNBC of the roll-back provision in the spending bill. However, both Lew and the White House stopped well short of issuing a veto threat against the measure. 
Warren and others urged Democrats to withhold support until the provision was dropped. Some also demanded the removal of a provision that allows a massive increase in individual contributions to national political parties for federal elections, potentially up to $777,600 a year. 
""I am increasingly optimistic that House Democrats will come together to defeat this effort to protect Wall Street's biggest banks,"" said Representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee. 
She said many Democrats spoke out against the provision at a meeting Thursday morning. Aides to House Democratic leaders said, however, that they were not actively campaigning to defeat the bill. 
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Republicans would not make any last-minute changes, adding: ""I think we will be fine."" 
Democratic support is seen as critical to passage of the spending bill in the House, as Republican aides and lawmakers say it is unlikely their party would be able to muster enough votes for passage on its own. 
The spending bill would keep most federal agencies funded through September 2015, except for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which would get an extension only through Feb. 27. 

The plan is intended to give Democrats leverage over DHS next year, when they control the Senate and a stronger House majority. They intend to deny funding to the agency for implementation of Obama's order allowing millions of undocumented immigrants stay and work in the United States.

Revelations by former National Security Agency employee Edward Snowden that Washington carried out large-scale electronic espionage in Germany provoked widespread outrage -- particularly the allegation that the NSA had bugged Merkel's phone. 
Harald Range launched an official investigation in June, believing there was enough preliminary evidence to show unknown U.S. intelligence officers had tapped the phone, although there was not enough clarity on the issue to bring charges. 
On Wednesday he said however, ""the document presented in public as proof of an actual tapping of the mobile phone is not an authentic surveillance order by the NSA. It does not come from the NSA database. 
""There is no proof at the moment which could lead to charges that Chancellor Merkel's phone connection data was collected or her calls tapped."" 
Range said neither a reporter for German news magazine Spiegel who presented the document, nor Germany's BND foreign intelligence agency, nor Snowden had provided further details to his office. The investigation continues, however. 
The spying affair severely tested ties between Berlin and Washington, but Berlin's pleas for a ""no-spy"" agreement with the U.S. came to nothing. 

Snowden has sought refuge in Moscow. Merkel's government has shied away from bringing him to Berlin to testify to a parliamentary enquiry into the espionage, fearing it would further damage relations with Washington.

A telephone poll of 1,340 registered New Jersey voters by Quinnipiac University found that Christie, and every other potential Republican contender for the 2016 White House race, would lose the state to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the possible Democratic candidate. 
Among voters in the traditionally blue state, Clinton tops Christie 50 percent to 39 percent; former Florida Governor Jeb Bush 53 to 31; Kentucky Senator Rand Paul 55 to 31; and 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney 52 to 35 percent, according to poll results. 
Christie's popularity among his home-state voters has slipped, with 45 percent for Christie versus 49 percent for Clinton in February 2013, 42 percent for Christie versus 50 percent for Clinton in August 2014 and 39 percent for Christie versus 50 percent for Clinton in December 2014, the survey showed.

KABUL (Reuters) - The United States said on Thursday it had shut its last detention facility in Afghanistan and no longer had custody of detainees there, closing a much-criticized chapter in Washington's fight against Islamic extremism. 
The U.S. Defense Department said it had recently transferred the last detainees from Bagram Airfield north of the capital, Kabul. It closed the prison there on Dec. 10, a day after a Senate report detailed abuse at a secret CIA prison in Afghanistan. 
The U.S. embassy in Kabul said the closure decision was linked to a deadline to end the detention program in Afghanistan this year, not to the Senate report. 
""The Government of Afghanistan will be responsible for all detention facilities,"" from Jan. 1, an embassy spokesman said. 
Foreign prisoners at the various sites in Bagram, often compared to Cuba's Guantanamo Bay jail, were given no trials, facing only review boards staffed by U.S. military officers. At its peak, the Bagram prison held hundreds of detainees. 
A U.S. court found two adult detainees had been beaten to death at Bagram in 2002. The U.S. government said such cases of abuse were rare. 
The last few weeks have seen a flurry of transfers from Bagram, including a top Pakistani Taliban militant returned to Pakistan this week. Tunisian detainee Redha al Najar was placed in Afghan custody on Tuesday, his lawyer said. 
Najar, one of the longest-serving detainees of the U.S. ""war on terror"", was captured as a suspected bodyguard of Osama Bin Laden in May 2002. 
He and another Tunisian, who lawyer Tina Foster said was also transferred to Afghan custody, received harsh treatment at a secret CIA facility that the intelligence agency described as a ""dungeon"" in the Senate report. 
Lawyers in Pakistan for some of the detainees said they sought a full list of those who had been moved recently. 
Pakistani citizen Kamil Shah, released without trial after five years in U.S. custody in Afghanistan from 2004, when he was 16, said he was beaten by U.S. personnel during his stay in Bagram. 
""I was in isolation for 11 months,"" said Shah, who was among some 2,500 juveniles the United Nations identified as having been detained in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo Bay by the United States since 2001.

Both U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and U.S. ambassador to China Max Baucus issued statements on Wednesday to mark International Human Rights Day in which they mentioned cases such as the imprisoned Chinese Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo.

China and the United States often spar about each other's human rights records, and on Wednesday, Beijing urged Washington to ""correct its ways"" following the torture report. 
China's criticism of the United States has come in the same week that a Chinese court handed down sentences of up to eight years in prison to seven students of jailed scholar Ilham Tohti, a member of the Muslim Uighur minority, in the western region of Xinjiang, in a case that has attracted concern in the West. 
The United States was ignoring the facts about the great strides China has made to improve human rights, Hong said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Marijuana advocates on Wednesday urged Congress not to use a spending bill to overturn a local referendum that overwhelmingly backed legalizing pot in the District of Columbia. 
A $1.1 trillion spending bill negotiated by lawmakers on Tuesday barred the U.S. capital from using funds to implement Initiative 71, which legalized possession of small amounts of marijuana in Washington. 
Voters easily approved the measure last month but Congress has the power to restrict D.C. municipal spending. A provision in the bill bars any spending by the District to legalize or reduce penalties for marijuana. 
Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district's non-voting representative in Congress, said in a statement the amendment on marijuana was unclear. 
She said she would try to have it removed from the bill before the full House of Representatives and Senate vote on it. The measure funds federal agencies that otherwise would run out of money at midnight on Thursday. 
""The District of Columbia government and its residents should never be put in the position of uncertainty of any kind about any of their local laws,"" Norton said. 
Dr. Malik Burnett, policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance, said Initiative 71 was a civil rights issue since blacks made up 90 percent of district marijuana arrests even though non-blacks used pot at similar rates. 
""D.C. voters chose to reform their marijuana laws, which have a direct impact on how communities of color interact with police. Congress should not undermine this,"" he said. 
Protesters waving a District of Columbia flag bearing the slogan ""No Taxation Without Representation"" briefly blocked traffic a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday evening. Police stood by but made no arrests. 
Malik Burnett of the D.C. Cannabis Campaign said 70 percent of voters supported legalization. 
""Now Congress has said the District of Columbia cannot carry out the will of the people,"" he said. 
Some Republican lawmakers, led by Representative Andy Harris of Maryland, had balked at legalization in Washington. The city has one of the lightest U.S. penalties for pot possession, although marijuana is illegal under federal law. 
The White House warned Congress in July to leave the District of Columbia alone on legalization. But with prompt passage of the funding bill essential to avoiding a government shutdown, the legislation is not expected to be held up over the marijuana measure. 

Speaker John Boehner predicted the House would approve the measure on Thursday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - At the 11th hour of a scramble by the U.S. Congress to keep the federal government funded and open, Republicans in the House of Representatives on Wednesday called for making a handful of temporary tax breaks for charitable giving permanent. 
The last-minute move, led by Republican Representative Dave Camp, drew criticism from Democrats. They said his plan would add $11 billion to the national debt because it offers no new sources of tax revenue to offset the drain on the federal budget that making the tax breaks permanent would impose. 
Camp, who will retire from Congress within weeks, urged passage of a bill dealing with a tax break for donating property for conservation; one for donating food inventories; and one for making distributions from retirement plans to charities. 
""This legislation will ultimately increase charitable giving by making these policies permanent and enabling charities to better serve those in need,"" Camp said in a statement. 
His bill was debated on the House floor on Wednesday evening. A vote was called for, but was postponed. 
The White House has said it ""strongly opposes"" Camp's proposal on budgetary grounds and if the bill were presented for Democratic President Barack Obama's signature, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto it. 
All three tax breaks are now part of a package of dozens of temporary tax measures, known as the ""extenders,"" which Congress historically has renewed every year or two. 
The Republican-controlled House last week voted 378-46 to renew all 55 extenders, postponing further debate on them until 2015 and clearing a major hurdle in a race to develop a stopgap spending plan to prevent a government shutdown. 
The Democratic-controlled Senate has not voted on the extenders renewal, but its approval was widely expected. 
The renewal of the extenders, most of which expired at the end of 2013, was retroactive to Jan. 1, 2014, meaning taxpayers could claim the tax breaks for the 2014 tax year, including the charitable giving provisions being singled out by Camp. 
""This House has already taken action to provide for the three provisions included in this bill for this year's tax returns as part of the broad extender bill that passed last week,"" said Democratic Representative Sander Levin. 
He is the top Democrat on the House's tax committee; Camp is the top Republican. ""For this tax season these provisions are in effect. There's no doubt about that,"" Levin said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday approved a bill giving big insurance companies such as American International Group Inc and Prudential Financial Inc relief from part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank oversight law. 
Lawmakers agreed to give the U.S. Federal Reserve more authority to tailor the capital requirements it places on big insurers. The U.S. Senate approved the change in June, and it now goes to President Barack Obama for his signature. 
""The Fed now has the opportunity to write rules that will preserve competition and ensure affordable access to financial security,"" MetLife Inc Chief Executive Officer Steven Kandarian said in a statement. 
Global regulators want banks to rely less on debt and more on shareholder equity in an effort to make them more stable after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. 
Dodd-Frank applied the same strict standard to big insurers and other non-bank companies that regulators believe are risky enough that their failure could threaten markets. 
Insurers, however, said their business models were too different from banks' to justify identical capital rules. They said insurers hold different assets than banks do and are not subject to runs on their businesses in crises. 
Lawmakers, including Republican Senator Susan Collins, who wrote the relevant section of Dodd-Frank, and many regulators supported changing the law to give the Fed flexibility to write rules specifically aimed at insurers. 
The House passed legislation in September making that adjustment, but it also included other changes to Dodd-Frank that the Democrat-controlled Senate would not accept. On Wednesday, the House approved the Senate version.

110,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2014 07:28PM ET</span>",U.S. Congress closes out year without passing IMF reforms,"By Anna Yukhananov 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is preparing to leave town for the holidays without passing reforms to give emerging markets greater say at the International Monetary Fund, a step the Obama administration has warned could undermine Washington's international influence. 
The White House signed off on the reforms in 2010, but U.S. lawmakers need to back changes in how the IMF is funded before they can be put into place, given Washington's position as a controlling shareholder in the global lender. 
But a must-pass $1.1 trillion U.S. spending bill unveiled late on Tuesday omits the IMF voting reform provision, dooming prospects that it will get passed by a year-end deadline. 
Finance chiefs from around the world had given the United States until Jan. 1 to ratify the reforms, and have threatened to move forward without it if it fails to do so. 
The changes would double the fund's resources and hand more IMF voting power to countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, also known as BRICS. It would also revamp the IMF's board to reduce dominance of Western Europe. 
""Without these reforms, emerging economies may well look outside the IMF and the international economic system that we helped design,"" U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Nathan Sheets said last week. 
Some outside observers believe the lack of reforms was the impetus behind the decision of the BRICS nations to launch their own currency reserve pool and development bank earlier this year, intended as a challenge to Western dominance in global financial institutions. 
China also launched a proposed $50 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, seen as a direct rival to the Western-dominated World Bank and Asian Development Bank. 
Twice this year, BRICS nations threatened to veto a renewal of the IMF's crisis funds as a sign of their displeasure over the lack of reforms, according to several sources close to the IMF board. 
The crisis fund, known as the New Arrangements to Borrow, was meant as a temporary credit line. But the IMF has been forced to rely more heavily on the NAB and bilateral lending to fund bail-outs of countries like Ukraine and Jamaica while it waits for U.S. ratification of the reforms, which would double its main accounts. 
Some Republicans have complained the IMF changes would cost too much at a time of big budget deficits in Washington. They are also critical of how efficiently the IMF was helping struggling economies in Europe and the risks attached to billion-dollar IMF loans to countries like Greece. 
The Obama administration last made a big public push to include the IMF reforms in a broader funding package for Ukraine in March, but U.S. Senate Democrats dropped the language to ensure smooth passage of the bill. 
This time around, the administration appears to have run a quieter campaign, meeting numerous times with lawmakers on Capitol Hill over the past few months, according to a source familiar with the discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly. Sheets and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew also brought up the IMF issue during meetings with lawmakers, the source said. 
But three congressional aides, who requested anonymity, said the administration had not mounted a forceful push. 
""They haven't really put their shoulder into it, at all, in the last nine months,"" said one source familiar with IMF legislative issues.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation on Wednesday to impose sanctions on Venezuelan government officials found to have violated protesters' rights during demonstrations earlier this year. 
The Senate approved the measure on Monday, so the House's approval by voice vote sends it to the White House, where President Barack Obama's administration has signaled he would sign the legislation into law. 
The measure would deny visas and freeze assets of officials involved in what the law considers a crackdown on political opponents during three months of street protests in Venezuela over crime and the economy that left 43 dead. 
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro railed against the measure's ""insolent imperialist sanctions"" after it was passed by the Senate. Venezuela has accused the opposition of plotting with Washington to topple his government. 
Senator Robert Menendez, who sponsored the bill, called on other countries to follow the U.S. lead. 
""Governments in our hemisphere and throughout the world must stand in solidarity with the citizens of Venezuela by denying Venezuelan officials involved in human rights violations entry into their countries and access to their financial systems,"" he said.

112,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2014 06:20PM ET</span>",House passes six-year extension of terrorism insurance program,"By Emily Stephenson 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to extend a federal terrorism insurance program that was created after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, overcoming criticism from Democrats of a provision that would retool part of 2010 Wall Street reforms. 
The program is intended to support insurers by creating a federal backstop that kicks in if they lose a certain amount of money after an attack. It has never been triggered. 
Businesses, sports stadium owners and others that insure against attacks have said their costs could rise if the program is not renewed before it expires at the end of the year. 
Lawmakers in both parties want to renew the program but are in dispute over whether to include provisions related to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms. 
Democrats objected to the House plan but let it move forward, passing 417-7. It was not clear whether the Democrat-controlled Senate would take up the same version. 
""I urge the Senate to move on this bill and vote for these needed reforms,"" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, said in a statement. 
The House bill reauthorizes the program for six years and doubles the losses needed to trigger federal support to $200 million, changes agreed to by Senate negotiators. It also includes the Dodd-Frank provision. 
At issue is a portion of the 2010 law that requires swaps participants such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc to post margin against certain kinds of riskier swap deals. 
An early version of the law explicitly exempted energy, agriculture and other ""end-user"" businesses that use swaps to hedge risks. But the final text removed that protective language, raising concerns that it could lead to higher costs. 
The provision tacked into the insurance extension bill explicitly frees these ""end users"" from the rules. 
""This isn't for Wall Street. It's for Main Street,"" said House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, a Republican. 
Democrats, on the other hand, have argued the Dodd-Frank provision does not belong in the terrorism extension bill. The Senate passed a seven-year extension of the terrorism insurance program in July. 
""We should have a clean bill, with nothing else in it,"" said Representative Maxine Waters, who is the top Democrat on the Financial Services Committee. 
The White House said on Wednesday it opposed including Dodd-Frank modifications in an unrelated bill but stopped short of threatening to veto the insurance extension.

113,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2014 06:10PM ET</span>","For CIA, fallout from Senate report looks far from over","By Mark Hosenball and Warren Strobel 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As outcry grows over its now-defunct brutal interrogation program, America's spy agency appears caught in the crossfire of debate over its methods in the ongoing U.S. battle against Islamic militants and whether it has changed its ways. 
Inside the Central Intelligence Agency, intelligence officials expressed resentment over what they said was the unfairness of a Senate Intelligence Committee report released on Tuesday that harshly criticized the spy agency's detention and questioning of militant suspects. 
As Senate Democrats urged more information about the program be made public and CIA officials be held accountable, CIA Director John Brennan was scheduled to speak privately to the agency's employees on Wednesday about the Senate report. 
Brennan, who is close to U.S. President Barack Obama, on Tuesday acknowledged the agency made mistakes, but rejected some key Senate panel findings, including its conclusion that harsh interrogation techniques did not produce valuable intelligence about militants that could not be obtained by other means. 
""CIA is frequently asked to do difficult, sensitive and sometimes risky things on behalf of the country,"" a U.S. intelligence official said. ""Congress doesn't do massive studies of CIA's successful efforts such as preventing another massive casualty attack on the United States."" 
""The intellectual dishonesty of the (Senate) report will eventually be revealed and in the end CIA's position about the value of the detention and interrogation program will stand as the historical fact,"" the intelligence official said. 
Countries that cooperated with the CIA's post-Sept. 11, 2001 detention and interrogation program expressed dismay that its details became public. 
""Who now in any form is going to want to continue cooperation in the fight with global terrorism and with opponents of our world view, democracy, in this domain when the system is so dramatically liable to leak?"" Polish Deputy Prime Minister Janusz Piechocinski told Poland's TVN24 broadcaster. 
Poland has acknowledged allowing the CIA to operate a secret interrogation center on its territory. 
As details of the CIA program dribbled out over the years, the agency has faced Justice Department investigations - no prosecutions materialized - and worried it would lose cooperation from allied intelligence services. 
But even some who are sympathetic to the CIA say the agency bears the brunt of blame for the damage. 
""It's just a self-inflicted wound of the worst kind,"" said former CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz. 
TUG OF WAR 
In the continuing tug of war over the CIA program, retiring Sen. Mark Udall, Colorado Democrat, took to the U.S. Senate floor to disclose findings of an earlier CIA review that he said backs up the Senate Intelligence Committee majority report. 
The conclusions of the CIA study, known as the ""Panetta Review"" after former CIA director Leon Panetta, ""fly directly in the face of claims made by senior CIA officials past and present,"" Udall said, urging its declassification. 
He called for new legislation banning coercive interrogation techniques. 
CIA officials have said the Panetta Review was not an investigation that reached conclusions, but merely a factual account of the program's history. 
Significant new limits on the CIA's role and powers seem unlikely. Obama has placed the agency at the forefront of battling Islamic militants worldwide, including using armed drones. 
Obama is known to rely heavily on the counsel of Brennan, formerly his top White House counter-terrorism advisor. And the CIA faces a more sympathetic Congress next year, when Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who was critical of the 'torture"" report, replaces Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. 
COULD IT HAPPEN AGAIN? 
Obama in 2009 issued an executive order barring the CIA from operating detention facilities and conducting ""enhanced interrogation."" 
The CIA on Tuesday said it had already taken steps to address issues raised in the report, including better management of sensitive programs and enhanced vetting of CIA officers who participate in them. 
Philip Zelikow, who as a top State Department official in 2006 wrote a secret memo arguing some of the CIA techniques were unconstitutional, said the CIA's assurances were insufficient. 
The Senate report ""does raise some important issues regarding the management of covert activities,"" he said. 
The report ""will have for some time, and some time can mean for years, a chastening effect. But over time the agency does what it does,"" said Glenn Carle, a retired CIA officer who questioned prisoners after 2001. 

""I think generations will forget,"" he said. ""And the institution strives to serve the executive. And there will be mistakes again.""

114,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2014 05:25PM ET</span>",Illinois Supreme Court speeds up pension reform law appeal,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Illinois Supreme Court on Wednesday fast-tracked the state's appeal of a trial court ruling that found a new law aimed at easing the state's huge pension burden unconstitutional. 
The court ordered public labor unions and retiree groups challenging the law and the state to file their briefs in January and February with oral arguments to be scheduled in March. Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan had asked the court last week to speed up the appeal process. 
The state asked for oral arguments as early as Jan. 22 and no later than March 10 to enable Illinois' upcoming budget to incorporate about $1 billion in cost-savings under the law, or adequate spending cuts or tax increases to offset those savings. 
The pension reform law was supposed to go into effect on June 1 but was put on hold by Sangamon County Circuit Court Judge John Belz in May pending his Nov. 21 ruling in five consolidated lawsuits. The state's new fiscal year begins July 1 and the legislature usually passes a budget by May 31. 
The law's opponents asked the supreme court on Tuesday not to speed up the case. 
Illinois has the worst-funded state retirement system in the country, and its unfunded pension liability hit $104.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2014. No U.S. state has a lower credit rating than Illinois. 
The reform law, which was enacted in December 2013, reduces and suspends cost-of-living increases for pensions, raises retirement ages and limits salaries on which pensions are based. 
Employees contribute 1 percent less of their salaries toward pensions, while contributions from the state, which has skipped or skimped on its pension payments over the years, are enforceable through the Illinois Supreme Court. 
In his ruling last month, Belz rejected Illinois' arguments that pensions could be cut to protect the public welfare in an emergency, including the state's precarious financial situation. He concluded that the state could not go back on a promise protected by a provision in the Illinois Constitution prohibiting public worker pensions from being impaired or diminished.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a victory for oil and gas industry advocates, a $1.1 trillion spending bill to fund the U.S. government most of next year would block the Obama administration from protecting several species of birds found in western states.The proposed compromise spending bill would prohibit the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from listing the greater sage-grouse as endangered or threatened and stop the service from working to implement protections for the Gunnison sage-grouse, which the agency listed as threatened last month. 
Republicans successfully negotiated a number of policy provisions into the measure, which aims to avoid a government shutdown at midnight on Thursday. It is expected to be put to a House of Representatives vote on Thursday, while Senate passage would follow by a day or two, congressional aides said. 
Oil industry groups and some western state governors have fought a potential listing for the sage-grouse, arguing that enacting federal protections for the birds' expansive territory would severely curtail oil and gas drilling in these areas. 
The greater sage-grouse inhabits 186 million acres in nearly a dozen states, according to the Western Energy Alliance, which opposes a federal listing for the bird. The group says industry and local governments are already working to protect the species. 
But environmentalists say greater sage-grouse populations have fallen sharply in the past 50 years. Green groups have sued the service to force it to take action on the bird. 
A court-approved settlement had set a September 2015 deadline for the agency to issue a decision on listing the sage-grouse. In anticipation of that, western state officials and developers had been working on voluntary conservation plans in an effort to stave off federal intervention. 
""This rider makes it all the more essential that we dig in and get good conservation in place, fast,"" said Eric Holst, senior director of the working lands at the Environmental Defense Fund. ""Time is one thing the greater sage grouse does not have.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will travel to Rome on Sunday for talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on developments in Israel and the West Bank, the State Department said on Wednesday. 
""John Kerry will travel to Rome on Sunday to meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu on developments in Israel, the West Bank, Jerusalem and region,"" department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Twitter. 
The talks come as Israeli politicians campaign ahead of March elections. 
Psaki said the meeting will include discussions on various proposals at the United Nations to create a Palestinian state. Jordan circulated a Palestinian-drafted resolution to the 15-member council last month calling for Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory to end by November 2016. 
France, Britain and Germany are also drafting a resolution. 
""There are a growing number of countries that are pushing for action on this issue at the U.N.,"" Psaki said, adding: ""This warrants discussion with Israel, the Palestinians and key members of the international community."" 
Palestinians seek statehood in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and blockaded Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as their capital. All three areas were captured by Israel in the 1967 war. 
Israel accepts the ""two-state solution"" of an independent and democratic Palestinian state alongside Israel, but has not accepted the 1967 pre-war borders as the basis for final negotiations, citing security and other concerns. 
Meanwhile, tensions between Israel and the Palestinian Authority escalated on Wednesday after a Palestinian minister died shortly after an Israeli border policeman shoved and grabbed him by the throat during a protest in the West Bank. 
Psaki said the United States was ""deeply concerned"" over the death of Ziad Abu Ein, a minister without portfolio, and called for a swift, fair and transparent investigation of his death. Abu Ein was convicted of killing two young Israelis in a bomb attack in 1979 and released as part of a prisoner swap in 1985.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers voiced deep skepticism on Wednesday about President Barack Obama's handling of the war against Islamic State rebels in Iraq and Syria, charging that his response had been slow and ""dithering"" and warning the strategy did not match the threat. 
Ambassador Brett McGurk, the deputy presidential envoy for countering Islamic State, told lawmakers the administration was making progress in the effort to destroy Islamic State, defeat al Qaeda and encourage the departure of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 
But members in the Republican-led House Foreign Affairs Committee questioned the Obama strategy. ""These aren't realistic plans that can truly destroy ISIL, can defeat al Nusra and defeat the Assad regime,"" Florida Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said. 
McGurk testified that U.S. efforts to train moderate Syrian opposition fighters were expected to begin in March and produce some 5,000 troops a year. Lawmakers questioned whether they could hold out that long. 
""We haven't even begun the train-and-equip mission,"" Ros-Lehtinen said. ""And we're about a year away from even standing that minimal force up, if ever at all."" 
Representative Ed Royce, the California Republican who chairs the panel, said he worried ""about the dithering"" that was slowing the administration's response. 
He said as Islamic State captured ""city by city by city,"" members of Congress warned about the threat. But from the administration there was ""still no action, still discussions, still dithering,"" Royce said. 
McGurk said the effort against Islamic State would be a ""long-term, multi-year campaign"" and he said the air strikes and other elements of the strategy had produced signs of progress. 
""ISIL's offensive has been halted, its ability to mass and maneuver forces degraded, its leadership cells pressured or eliminated,"" McGurk said. He said Islamic State was losing more than 100 fighters a week in combat, including top commanders. 
Representative Joe Wilson, a South Carolina Republican, questioned the slow movement of weapons to Iraqi and Kurdish forces. 
""I'm really concerned that the president's actions don't match the threat,"" he said. 
Representative Eliot Engel of New York, the panel's top Democrat, voiced concern about Iran's role in the fight, noting it was partly responsible for the sectarian strife that led to the rise of Islamic State. 
""We need to be very wary of Iran,"" Engel said. ""It's not simply the enemy of my enemy is my friend. ... I think we need to be very, very careful not to stumble down that path.""

Obama praised Republican-led states like Oklahoma and Georgia for their preschool programs, saying the federal government can help other states follow their lead. 
""They're not known as wild-eyed liberal states,"" Obama said. ""But it just goes to show you that this is an issue that's bigger than politics."" 
Fewer than a third of U.S. 4-year-olds are currently enrolled in preschool programs that help them do better when they get to elementary school and help increase their learning and earning potential later in life. 
The United States ranks 28th in access to preschool among industrialized nations. ""Quite frankly, as a nation, we should be ashamed,"" Education Secretary Arne Duncan told reporters. 
Obama has proposed $75 billion in federal investments over 10 years to help states provide preschool for 4-year-olds from low- and moderate-income households. 
States currently spend more than $5 billion on preschool programs, according to the National Institute for Early Education. 
Obama said the Education Department will give more than $226 million in grants to 18 states to enroll more than 33,000 kids in programs, and the Health and Human Services Department will give up to $500 million for Head Start and child care programs for more than 30,000 infants and toddlers. 
The private sector has also pledged more than $330 million to preschool projects, including $55 million from Walt Disney Co, and $25 million from the family foundation of J.B. Pritzker, a Chicago businessman whose sister is Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday granted four more companies exemptions to use drones commercially, further opening the airspace to unmanned aircraft even as lawmakers raised questions about the risks. 
Trimble Navigation Ltd, VDOS Global LLC, Clayco Inc and Woolpert Inc said in their petitions to the FAA that they would operate drones weighing less than 55 pounds (25 kg) and keep them within view at all times. 
The approvals broaden the uses of commercial drones to include aerial surveying, construction site monitoring and oil rig flare stack inspections. Previous FAA exemptions were for aerial photography by seven television and film companies. 
The FAA is expected to release a draft rule on drones by the end of December. The latest approvals came as the FAA and other industry officials were questioned by Congress on Wednesday about the safety and benefits of drone use. 
The FAA has been under mounting pressure from companies seeking to employ drones to survey crops, inspect remote power lines and pipelines or deliver packages, or other uses. 
The U.S. drone industry is expected to generate $13.6 billion in economic activity and create 70,000 jobs in the three years after commercial use restrictions are lifted, according to the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International. 
The FAA bans most commercial drone flights, but is required by Congress to integrate drones into the U.S. airspace by September 2015. 
Capt. Lee Moak, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, brought a small quad-copter to a House aviation subcommittee hearing on Wednesday that he noted was capable of flying at 6,600 feet for 15 minutes. 
""That means it could easily end up in the same airspace I occupy when I am on approach to land at Newark, Seattle, or any other airport,"" he said, noting increased reports of drone sightings by pilots. 
He urged the FAA not to allow pressure to rapidly integrate drones into the national airspace and compromise safety. 
But others pressed for much more rapid FAA action. Rep. Roger Williams, a Texas Republican, said Amazon.com has had difficulty getting FAA permission for outdoor tests of package delivery in Washington state. Amazon told the FAA this week it has begun testing outside the United States because of the restrictions. 
The FAA's associate safety administrator, Peggy Gilligan, said the agency knows Amazon is unsatisfied and expects to ""reach some conclusions shortly"" on its application for an exemption.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday fell in line behind a $1.1 trillion bill that would remove the threat of an imminent government shutdown while setting up new fights for early next year over President Barack Obama's immigration reforms. 
House Speaker John Boehner huddled early in the day with his often rambunctious rank-and-file Republicans and heard little opposition to the massive spending bill that was negotiated with congressional Democrats, according to lawmakers at the meeting. 
""Tomorrow we'll pass a responsible bill that will keep the government running,"" Boehner declared to reporters following the closed-door meeting. 
Without fast action by Congress, federal agencies would run out of money at midnight on Thursday. A White House spokesman said he was encouraged by the movement in Congress on a compromise measure. 
While the legislation would fund most federal agencies through September, the end of the current fiscal year, it would pay for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) activities only through February. 
DHS is the main agency that will implement Obama's controversial executive action announced in November. Supported strongly by immigration activists and staunchly opposed by many Republicans, Obama's action eased deportation threats for around 4.7 million undocumented immigrants. 
The spending bill moving through Congress gives conservatives another chance next year to try to dismantle the president's initiative. 
""Without the threat of a government shutdown, it sets up a direct challenge to the president's unilateral actions on immigration when we have new majorities of both chambers of Congress"" next year, Boehner said. 
But it was unclear whether the new, Republican-controlled Congress will actually be able to stop Obama's executive actions, and some House conservatives derided the decision to put off the showdown until next year. 
""I think we'll just roll over and capitulate in February if we're not going to fight now,"" said Republican Representative John Fleming of Louisiana, a Tea Party activist. 
Besides enjoying a stronger House majority and a new Senate majority next year that will help them advance legislation, Republican leaders in Congress are eager to demonstrate now that they can act responsibly by keeping the government operating. 
Republicans forced a 16-day government shutdown in October 2013 that was widely criticized and damaged the party's brand. 
If the House passes the spending bill on Thursday, as Boehner predicted, it will be sent to the Senate. It was unclear whether any senators would erect time-consuming procedural hurdles that could delay its passage for up to a few days. 
Anticipating such maneuvers, congressional leaders were preparing a very short-term funding bill, possibly providing funds for just a few days, while the $1.1 trillion measure moves through Congress and to Obama's desk for signing into law.

125,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2014 12:33PM ET</span>","Ex-CIA officials say torture report is one-sided, flawed","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of former top-ranking CIA officials disputed a U.S. Senate committee's finding that the agency's interrogation techniques produced no valuable intelligence, saying such work had saved thousands of lives. 
Former CIA directors George Tenet, Porter Goss and Michael Hayden, along with three ex-deputy directors, wrote in an op-ed article published on Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal that the Senate Intelligence Committee report also was wrong in saying the agency had been deceptive about its work following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. 
""The committee has given us ... a one-sided study marred by errors of fact and interpretation - essentially a poorly done and partisan attack on the agency that has done the most to protect America after the 9/11 attacks,"" they said. 
The report concluded the CIA failed to disrupt any subsequent plots despite torturing captives during the presidency of George W. Bush. 
But the former CIA officials said the United States never would have tracked down and killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011 without information acquired in the interrogation program. Their methods also led to the capture of ranking al Qaeda operatives, provided valuable information about the organization and saved thousands of lives by disrupting al Qaeda plots, including one for an attack on the U.S. West Coast that could have been similar to the Sept. 11 attacks. 
The former CIA officials defended the interrogation program by saying agents were in an unprecedented daily ""'ticking time bomb' scenario"" that required quick action. 
They said the committee report was ""flat-out wrong"" in saying the CIA misled the White House, Justice Department, Congress and the public about its methods. The CIA sought and received confirmation from the White House and Justice Department for its programs and also kept Congress informed, they said. 
""In no way would we claim that we did everything perfectly, especially in the emergency and often-chaotic circumstances we confronted in the immediate aftermath of 9/11,"" the former officials wrote. ""As in all wars, there were undoubtedly things in our program that should not have happened. When we learned of them, we reported such instances to the CIA inspector general or the Justice Department and sought to take corrective action."" 

The intelligence officials criticized the committee staff for not interviewing any of them and said the staff had already concluded the interrogation methods gave no useful intelligence before conducting their investigation.

126,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2014 11:10AM ET</span>",Trade authorization deal faces test from U.S. legislators,"By Krista Hughes 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A push by the White House to woo free trade skeptics on Capitol Hill will help bills through the next Congress, but lawmakers are unlikely to simply wave through legislation that holds the key to deals covering two-thirds of the world economy. 
President Barack Obama plans to advocate for a bill allowing the administration to negotiate trade deals and fast-track them through Congress with no amendments. 
Fast-track authority, likely the first test of free trade sentiment in the new Congress, will require 218 votes in the House of Representatives and 60 in the Senate to avoid a filibuster, a Senate delaying tactic. 
A Reuters examination of lawmakers' voting records and trade views suggests passage is not a done deal even though Republicans, considered more supportive of trade, won control of both chambers of Congress in November's election. 
That boosted hopes for a U.S. trade agenda involving deals with European and Pacific partners which supporters say will add nearly $500 billion to annual global output. 
But the midterms also hit the ranks of congressional trade liberalizers. Trade supporters will have to shepherd relatively new or incoming lawmakers who are untested on trade, limit Republican defections, and convince some Senators to change past votes. 
Virginia's Gerry Connolly, a leader of the pro-trade New Democrats, expected fast-track to pass in 2015 but said: ""It won't be an easy vote, it will not be a slam dunk, the White House will have to fight for it."" 
There is core support for free trade in the next Congress. In the House, 195 members have shown strong or moderate backing for trade deals, compared to 85-odd opponents. 
But not all trade supporters back fast-track authority for the President, with conservative Republicans opposed to delegating power to the White House. In the House, 37 free-traders have voted against fast-track authority or signed letters of concern. 
The 2015 House contains 219 Republicans who have not openly voiced opposition to fast-track and 17 Democrats who voted for three major 2011 trade deals. Connolly said the ""maximum universe"" of Democrat votes was 50, even with White House efforts. 
In the Senate, 60 of the 2015 members have strong or moderate pro-trade voting records, although five of those are Republicans who have voted against fast-track before. 
Passage of trade bills is not easy partly because the number of departing staunch supporters of free trade, who backed the last fast-track bill in 2002, outnumbers departing die-hard opponents two-to-one. Many newcomers have not shown their hands. 
Roughly two-thirds of the 43 incoming Republican House members were endorsed by the pro-trade U.S. Chamber of Commerce, although some who spoke to Reuters wanted more information before committing to fast-track. Others oppose it. 
Incoming Oklahoma representative Steve Russell, a military veteran and rifle manufacturer, said lawmakers should do their ""due diligence"" while Nevada state politician and small businessman Cresent Hardy said Congress should vet trade deals. 
Business groups expect the final bill to be one both parties can support, although some steps that could sway Democrat skeptics could alienate Republicans and vice-versa. 
New Democrat caucus chair Ron Kind warned if Congress did not extend aid for workers hurt by imports ""the bipartisan effort could break down real quick.""

128,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2014 06:40AM ET</span>",Congress reaches deal for $1.1 trillion U.S. spending bill,"By David Lawder 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional negotiators unveiled a $1.1 trillion U.S. spending bill that aims to avoid a government shutdown at midnight on Thursday and punts an immigration showdown between Republicans and President Barack Obama until February. 
As the funding deadline loomed, Republicans successfully negotiated a number of policy provisions into the measure, including easing of regulations ranging from the environment to financial derivatives trading. 
The measure was expected to be put to a House of Representatives vote on Thursday. But to enable Senate passage, a short-term extension of one or two days was being prepared, congressional aides said. 
""This bill will allow us to fulfill our constitutional duty to responsibly fund the federal government and avoid a shutdown,"" House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers said in a statement. 
The measure largely keeps unchanged fiscal 2015 domestic spending, while adding funds to fight Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria and to fight Ebola in West Africa. 
It funds all government agencies through September 2015, except for the Department of Homeland Security, which would be extended only through Feb. 27. That move aims to give Republicans leverage over the agency implementing Obama's immigration order. 
Next year, when Republicans control both the House and Senate, they intend to pass restrictions barring federal funds for Obama's plan to let millions of undocumented immigrants stay and work in the United States. 
Current government spending authority expires at 12:01 a.m. EST on Friday. 
Negotiations were delayed by wrangling over a Republican effort to block new curbs on derivatives trade that would require banks to shift these activities to units that do not benefit from federal deposit insurance and Federal Reserve loans. 
The compromise that ended up in the bill grants a reprieve for derivatives trades on behalf of farmers and other commodity producers, who had feared the rule would require them to put up more collateral. 
A bipartisan provision to shore up distressed multi-employer pension plans and the government fund that guarantees them was taken out of the bill and proposed as an amendment facing a separate vote. Changes include raising insurance premiums for these plans and allowing them to cut benefits for non-disabled beneficiaries under 75. 

A six-year extension for a federal terrorism insurance backstop created after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks was also excluded from the funding bill and is being dealt with separately.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tacked at the end of the 1,603-page government spending bill released by the U.S. House of Representatives late Tuesday is a provision that would enable wealthy individuals to make significantly larger contributions to political parties. 
Under current campaign finance law, individuals cannot give more than $32,400 a year to the Democratic National Committee or the Republican National Committee. But a section on ""other matters"" on page 1,599 of the spending bill sets separate limits for donations earmarked for the national parties' political conventions, buildings and potential recount efforts. 
Individuals would be allowed to donate three times the annual party contribution limit to each of the earmarked efforts in addition to the party itself, effectively allowing one person to funnel $324,000 a year to party efforts. 
Good government groups were surprised by the inclusion of the language, believing they had averted earlier efforts to include a campaign-finance provision related to coordination between independent groups and political candidates. 
""The price for seat at the table in Washington just went up again and even further out of reach for all but the very richest of Americans,"" Campaign Legal Center President Meredith McGehee said in a statement. 
Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer said leaders from both parties had secretly entered into an ""unholy alliance"" to undermine a 2002 bipartisan campaign finance reform law. 
""These provisions have never been considered by the House or Senate, and were never even publicly mentioned before today,"" Wertheimer said in a statement. 
The nonprofit groups Public Campaign and Common Cause also criticized the inclusion of a political contribution expansion in the bill funding government programs. 
The House is expected to vote on the spending bill on Thursday.

130,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2014 08:20PM ET</span>",CIA paid Poland to ease qualms over secret prison: Senate report,"By Christian Lowe and Wiktor Szary 
WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland threatened to halt the transfer of al Qaeda suspects to a secret CIA jail on its soil 11 years ago, but became more ""flexible"" after the Central Intelligence Agency gave it a large sum of money, according to a U.S. Senate report. 
U.S. President Barack Obama discussed the report's forthcoming publication during a telephone call on Monday with Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz, administration officials and the Polish government said. 
The heavily redacted report does not mention Poland. But it is clear it refers to the country because details such as the names of three detainees and the dates they were transferred match other documents, including a European Court of Human Rights ruling relating to a CIA-run ""black site"" in Poland. 
The details also match interviews with people with knowledge of a Polish investigation into the alleged facility. 
The CIA declined to comment on the Senate report, and Polish officials have always denied the CIA ran a jail in Poland. 
A Polish government spokeswoman did not answer calls to her mobile phone seeking comment on the Senate report, or reply to emailed questions. A foreign ministry spokesman asked for questions in writing, but did not immediately respond when they were sent. A spokesman for Leszek Miller, who was Polish Prime Minister at the time the alleged CIA jail was running, declined to comment. 
According to a ruling by the Strasbourg-based European Court, between 2002 and 2003 the CIA operated a facility near the northeast Polish village of Stare Kiejkuty, one of a network of sites around the world where al Qaeda suspects were held and subjected to interrogation techniques human rights groups say amounted to torture.   
The report published on Tuesday by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence described how seriously the CIA's rendition program strained relations with Poland, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member and one of Washington's staunchest European allies. 
People close to the Polish authorities at the time say Poland felt an obligation to protect its relationship with Washington, even as it knew hosting the facility was open to legal challenge. 
""The agreement to host a CIA detention facility in Country () created multiple, ongoing difficulties between Country () and the CIA,"" the report said. All mentions of the name of the country were blacked out. 
It said the country proposed drawing up a written memorandum of understanding defining the CIA's roles and responsibilities at the facility, but the agency refused. 
The host country's government then refused to accept the planned transfer of new detainees, who the report said included Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on U.S. cities. 
""The decision was reversed only after the U.S. ambassador intervened with the political leadership of Country () on the CIA's behalf. The following month, the CIA provided $ () million"" to the country, the report said, blacking out the amount of money handed over. 
The report did not name the ambassador. The U.S. ambassador to Poland at the time was Christopher Hill. A woman who answered the telephone in his office at the University of Denver, where he now works, said he was not reachable until Wednesday afternoon. 
After the money changed hands, officials speaking for the country's political leadership indicated the country ""was now flexible with regard to the number of CIA detainees at the facility and when the facility would eventually be closed,"" according to the report. 
Years later, officials in the country were ""extremely upset"" when details of the detention program began to emerge from U.S. government sources, and were disappointed not to have had more warning before President George W. Bush publicly acknowledged the program existed in 2006, it said. 
Adam Bodnar, vice-president of the Warsaw-based Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, said of the Polish authorities at the time: ""They betrayed the Polish constitution for money, to a great extent, and all the values that are associated with the Polish constitution."" 
The Polish constitution states that no one can be subjected to torture, or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.  
Bodnar said the diplomatic tensions outlined in the report explain why Obama telephoned the Polish Prime Minister on the eve of the report's publication. 
The two leaders ""expressed hope that the publication of this report will not have a negative effect on Polish-U.S. relations,"" according to a statement from the Polish prime minister's office. 
Senior U.S. administration officials confirmed the subject of the Senate report came up during Obama's call with Kopacz. 
A Polish foreign ministry spokesman, Marcin Wojciechowski, said on Tuesday he hoped the Senate report would shed new light on allegations there was a CIA jail in Poland, and that it would give new impetus to an investigation into the allegations by Polish prosecutors that has been running since 2008. 
""The Polish state's intention is to investigate and establish the truth in this case."" he said. 
The Washington Post newspaper reported in January this year, citing unnamed former CIA officials, that the agency paid $15 million to Poland for use of the facility, handing over the cash in two cardboard boxes. 
At the time of the newspaper's report, Polish officials did not respond directly to questions about whether they had received the cash. The United States has never disclosed which countries hosted the CIA detention centers overseas. 
Representatives of the European Court of Human Right did not respond to calls on Tuesday evening seeking comment about the Senate report.

By unanimous voice votes, the Senate approved former State Department official Richard Rahul Verma as U.S. ambassador to India and Peter Michael McKinley to be the ambassador in Kabul. 
Verma, who is Indian-American, will replace Nancy Powell, who resigned in March after a damaging dispute over the treatment of a junior Indian diplomat in the United States. 
He served as assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs at the State Department in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2011. 
The United States sees India as a natural ally on a range of issues and a potential counterbalance to an increasingly assertive China in Asia and is eager to expand relations across the board, particularly in the security sphere. 
McKinley, a career diplomat who has also served as U.S. ambassador in Colombia and Peru, is currently the deputy ambassador in Afghanistan, where the United States is drawing down its forces after 12 years of war. 
He replaces the current ambassador, James Cunningham, who has held the Kabul post since 2012. 
The White House has been fighting with the Senate all year to get its nominees confirmed more quickly. The last days of the current legislative session have been marked by a flurry of confirmations. A new Senate, in which Republicans will hold a majority of seats, will be seated in January.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Tuesday called on lawmakers to reauthorize a federal terrorism insurance program, saying they should not tie its approval to consideration of proposed changes to unrelated Wall Street reforms. 
The federal insurance program was created after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and is set to expire at the end of the year. Businesses, owners of sports stadiums and other groups that insure against terrorist acts have lobbied for its renewal. 
The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly in July to extend the program, called the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. But negotiations with the House of Representatives stalled when Republicans tried to include changes to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law in the extension bill. 
Lew said in a letter to U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat who has been negotiating over the insurance program, that lawmakers should quickly approve a clean extension without the unrelated regulatory changes. 
""Time is running short to head off an unnecessary, unprecedented and disruptive lapse of the program,"" Lew said in the letter, which was obtained by Reuters. 
The program was created to restore confidence after the 2001 attacks, when some companies stopped offering insurance against terrorist threats to commercial buildings. 
It has been reauthorized twice but the insurance, which kicks in after losses from an attack exceed a set amount, has never been triggered. 
The House bill, which extends the program for six years, is expected to be debated on Wednesday, according to the House Rules Committee. 
It includes a controversial tweak to a Dodd-Frank provision that requires participants in swap trades that do not go through a third-party clearinghouse to post collateral. The House Republicans' change would exempt certain agricultural and energy companies from this rule. 
Republicans and some Democrats support the change, but its passage is unlikely in the Senate, which has been hesitant to re-open the Dodd-Frank law. 
The bill also includes a provision that was approved by the Senate that would create a designated seat on the Federal Reserve for someone with community banking experience. 

A more popular tweak to Dodd-Frank that would loosen capital requirements for insurance companies was not in the terrorism insurance package and appeared set to move as a separate bill. The Senate approved that change in June.

133,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2014 07:20PM ET</span>",Obama tells Latinos immigration policy shift won't hurt them later,"By Jeff Mason 
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama sought to reassure Latinos on Tuesday that signing up for deportation relief under his new immigration policy was safe and would not put them in jeopardy if his White House successor tried to overturn the action. 
Supported strongly by immigration activists and staunchly opposed by many Republicans, Obama's controversial executive action removed the threat of deportation for up to 4.7 million undocumented immigrants. But it sparked fears that coming out of the shadows now could leave immigrants vulnerable later if another administration rescinded the policy. 
Under the policy enacted last month, eligible undocumented immigrants must submit to background checks and start paying taxes. 
During a town hall style question and answer session in Tennessee, Obama acknowledged a new president could try to reverse his orders. 
""It's true that, theoretically, a future administration could do something that I think would be very damaging,"" he said. ""It's not likely politically that they reverse everything that we've done, but it could be ... that some people then end up being in a disadvantageous position."" 
Nonetheless, he predicted that a future president would not reverse his policy because good-hearted Americans wanted immigrants who were registered and paying taxes to stay. 
""Any future administration that tried to punish people for doing the right thing, I think would not have the support of the American people,"" Obama added. 
Democrats largely support Obama's action and a successor from his party would be unlikely to change course, but a Republican president could shake up the system when Obama leaves office in early 2017. 
Hispanics are an important political constituency for both parties, but tilt toward Democrats. 
Obama noted it would take a lot of work from community organizations, churches and local agencies to register people. 
Only 55 percent of the estimated 1.2 million young people eligible under Obama's 2012 executive action - known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals - have applied, according to a report in August by the Migration Policy Institute. 
The latest program was modeled after DACA, which stopped deportation and granted work permits to immigrants brought illegally into the country as young children. 

The White House said Obama came to Nashville because the city has one of the fastest growing immigrant populations in the country.

134,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2014 05:30PM ET</span>",Prosecutions for CIA torture still seem unlikely after Senate report,"By Warren Strobel and Lawrence Hurley 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Minutes after a U.S. Senate intelligence panel released details of the CIA's torture of terrorism suspects, President Barack Obama suggested the country should move on. 
The U.S. Department of Justice, which has the power to bring criminal charges, looks set to take him at his word. 
Criminal prosecutions of those who ran secret prisons and ""enhanced interrogations"" between 2002 and 2006, look unlikely despite renewed demands by civil rights advocates. So do efforts to hold to account politicians who authorized the CIA actions. 
""Rather than another reason to refight old arguments, I hope that today's report can help us leave these techniques where they belong — in the past,"" said Obama, who banned harsh interrogation techniques after taking office in 2009. 
By then, President George W. Bush had ended many aspects of ""Rendition, Detention and Interrogation"" that he authorized after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States by Islamist militants. 
A senior law enforcement official said the Justice Department has no plans to reopen a criminal investigation. That inquiry, which narrowed to two cases in which prisoners died in CIA custody, was closed in 2012 with no criminal charges. 
The CIA and its supporters have opposed criminal investigations, arguing their actions were legally authorized by the Bush-era Justice Department and the White House. 
Accountability is needed, civil rights advocates say, to ensure that torture is not used in the future. 
The 500-plus page report by the Senate Intelligence Committee's majority Democrats provides details of torture and argues that the CIA lied to the White House, Congress and the public. 
""It reopens the issue of accountability,"" said Alberto Mora, who as the U.S. Navy's general counsel during the Bush administration, actively opposed the use of cruel interrogation practices at the Guantanamo Bay prison. 
Mora said it has been ""politically unthinkable"" that Bush and his top advisors would be prosecuted, but the report's publication means ""The shield that has been provided ... now may be no longer as effective as it was."" 
The only civilian ever charged with wrongdoing in the CIA's treatment of detainees after the Sept. 11 attacks is David Passaro, a CIA contractor convicted in 2006 of felony assault in the death of an Afghan prisoner. 
Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the Senate report provided a blueprint for possible prosecution. Romero also said that if Obama granted formal pardons to Bush administration officials, that would send a signal that torture prosecutions could occur in future. 
""Either you prosecute those who committed the torture or you grant the pardons. You don't pretend that the people who broke the law are not criminals,"" Romero said. 
There is also the possibility of criminal probes outside of the United States. Some former Bush aides have been warned against travel to Europe. In 2012 Italy convicted, in absentia, 22 CIA officers and an Air Force pilot for kidnapping an Egyptian cleric off the streets of Milan. 

""The fact that the policies revealed in this report were authorized at a high level within the U.S. Government provides no excuse whatsoever,"" Ben Emmerson, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on counter terrorism and human rights, said in a statement. ""Indeed, it reinforces the need for criminal accountability.""

State Attorney General Lisa Madigan last week asked the Illinois Supreme Court to speed up the appeal of Sangamon County Court Judge John Belz's Nov. 21 ruling, requesting oral arguments as soon as Jan. 22 and no later than March 10. 
She said the move was necessary to enable Illinois' fiscal 2016 budget to incorporate about $1 billion in cost-savings under the law, or adequate spending cuts or tax increases to offset those savings. 
The pension reform law was supposed to go into effect on June 1 but was put on hold by Belz in May pending his ruling in five consolidated lawsuits. The state's new fiscal year begins July 1 and the legislature usually passes a budget by May 31. 
Opponents of the law, including a coalition of labor unions and state retiree groups, said the normal appeals process should be followed, contending that the state was relying on ""a false sense of urgency."" 
Even if the state's high court determines as early as next month that the law is constitutional, the legal battle would head back to Sangamon County Court and continue well past May 31, according to their filing. 
Illinois has the worst-funded state retirement system in the country, and its unfunded pension liability hit $104.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2014. No U.S. state has a lower credit rating than Illinois. 
The reform law, which was enacted in December 2013, reduces and suspends cost-of-living increases for pensions, raises retirement ages and limits salaries on which pensions are based. 
Employees contribute 1 percent less of their salaries toward pensions, while contributions from the state, which has skipped or skimped on its pension payments over the years, are enforceable through the Illinois Supreme Court. 
In his ruling last month, Belz rejected Illinois' arguments that pensions could be cut to protect the public welfare in an emergency, including the state's precarious financial situation. He concluded that the state could not go back on a constitutionally-protected promise to its employees concerning their pension benefits.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday handed a victory to employers over worker compensation, ruling that companies do not have to pay employees for the time they spend undergoing security checks at the end of their shifts in a case involving an Amazon.com Inc warehousing contractor. 
The court decided by a 9-0 vote that employees of Integrity Staffing Solutions facilities in Nevada, where Amazon merchandise is processed and shipped, cannot claim compensation for time spent undergoing screening - up to half an hour a day, according to the workers - aimed at protecting against theft. 
The ruling is likely to benefit other companies facing similar lawsuits including Amazon, CVS Health Corp and Apple Inc, according to Integrity's lawyers. The cases against Amazon, Integrity and other staffing companies affect up to 400,000 workers, with plaintiffs claiming hundreds of millions of dollars in damages, according to court filings. 
Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said the allegations in the Integrity case of a lengthy security screening process were ""simply not true."" She added that Amazon's screening process is designed to take 90 seconds per employee at its facilities. 
Mark Thierman, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said the ruling leaves thousands of workers ""short-changed a half hour per day."" Many workers will still be able to pursue similar claims under state law, Thierman added. 
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote on behalf of the court that the screening process is not a ""principal activity"" of the workers' jobs under a law called the Fair Labor Standards Act and therefore is not subject to compensation. 
For workers to be paid, the activity in question must be ""an intrinsic element"" of the job and ""one with which the employee cannot dispense if he is to perform his principal activities,"" Thomas wrote. 
The high court reversed an April 2013 ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which had found that the screenings were an integral part of the warehousing job done for the benefit of the employer and should be compensated. 
Employees had sued Integrity Staffing Solutions for back wages and overtime pay, saying they should have been compensated for time spent in security screenings. 
Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, is not directly involved in the case. A business group called the Retail Litigation Center, in a brief supporting the warehousing company, said the industry in general loses $16 billion annually in thefts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The CIA routinely misled the White House and Congress over its harsh interrogation program for terrorism suspects and its methods, which included waterboarding, were more brutal than the agency acknowledged, a Senate report said on Tuesday. 
The program, devised by two agency contractors to squeeze information from suspects after the Sept. 11 2001 attacks, was ineffective and never led to the disruption of a single plot, the report by the Senate Intelligence Committee said. 
The program ran from 2002 to 2006 and involved questioning al Qaeda and other captives in secret detention facilities in various countries, including Afghanistan, Poland, Romania and Thailand. 
The report, which followed a five-year investigation, found the techniques used were ""far more brutal"" than the CIA told the public or policymakers. Its release prompted a boost of security at U.S. facilities abroad. 
""This document examines the CIA's secret overseas detention of at least 119 individuals and the use of coercive interrogation techniques - in some cases amounting to torture,"" committee chair Dianne Feinstein said. 
The CIA dismissed the findings, saying the interrogations did result in valuable information. Many Republicans condemned the report, which was put together by the committee's Democratic majority, saying it would put Americans at risk. 
Specific examples of brutality cited include the November 2002 death from hypothermia of a detainee held partially nude and chained to a concrete floor at a CIA prison. 
The report said the CIA had tried to justify its use of the program by giving examples of what it called ""thwarted"" terrorist plots and suspect captures, but the ""representations were inaccurate and contradicted by the CIA's own records."" 
SLEEP DEPRIVATION 
Some captives were deprived of sleep for up to 180 hours, at times with their hands shackled above their heads, and the report recorded cases of ""rectal feeding"" or ""rectal hydration"" without any documented medical need. 
It described one secret CIA prison, whose location was not identified, as a ""dungeon"" where detainees were kept in total darkness and shackled in isolated cells, bombarded with loud noise and given only a bucket in which to relieve themselves. 
It says that during one of the 83 occasions on which he was subjected to a simulated drowning technique the CIA called ""waterboarding,"" an al Qaeda detainee known as Abu Zubaydah became ""completely unresponsive with bubbles rising through his open full mouth,"" though he later was revived. 
The report said CIA records showed that seven of 39 CIA detainees subjected to harsh interrogations produced no intelligence at all while in CIA custody. Others made up stories, ""resulting in faulty intelligence."" 
It said: ""The methods in question, which were based on discredited coercive interrogation techniques such as those used by torturous regimes during the Cold War to elicit false confessions, regularly resulted in fabricated information."" 
The report also said the CIA had failed to use adequately trained and vetted personnel. Two psychologists were contracted to set up the program and run it, but neither had any experience in interrogation or specialized knowledge of al Qaeda 
One detainee subjected to some of the harshest treatment, Al Qaeda commander Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, accused of being the mastermind of the Sept. 11 hijacked plane attacks, was among the militants who gave interrogators false information, the report said. 
In his case, such information included a bogus claim that he had assigned Dhiren Barot, a British al Qaeda operative, to recruit African-Americans in Montana to the Qaeda cause. 
The report said internal CIA records described the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as evolving into a ""series of near drownings."" 
President Barack Obama said in a statement the techniques damaged American interests abroad without serving broad counter terrorism efforts. ""Rather than another reason to refight old arguments, I hope that today's report can help us leave these techniques where they belong, in the past,"" he said. 
CIA Director John Brennan acknowledged that the CIA detention and interrogation program ""had shortcomings and that the agency made mistakes."" 
But he denied the agency misled anyone about it and said the agency's own review indicated that detainees who were subjected to harsh interrogations ""did produce intelligence that helped thwart attack plans, capture terrorists and save lives."" 
A law enforcement official said that the Justice Department had no plans to conduct any investigation of the CIA's actions in light of the release of the report. 
Intelligence officials said that at one point, the Justice Department, through a specially-designated prosecutor conducted a criminal investigation into around 20 cases of allegations the CIA abused detainees. However, that investigation was closed without charges being filed. 
ENDANGERING LIVES 
The report charts the history of the CIA's ""Rendition, Detention and Interrogation"" program, which President George W. Bush authorized after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
Bush ended many aspects of the program before leaving office, and Obama swiftly banned ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" after his 2009 inauguration. 
Republican Senator John McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam in the 1960s, said Americans were entitled to the truth about the program and its disclosure that such methods were ineffective. 
Two Republican senators, Marco Rubio and Jim Risch, issued a statement calling the release of the report ""reckless and irresponsible."" 
They said it ""could endanger the lives of Americans overseas, jeopardize U.S. relations with foreign partners, potentially incite violence, create political problems for our allies, and be used as a recruitment tool for our enemies."" 
The executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, Anthony Romero, said in an opinion piece in The New York Times that Obama should issue formal pardons to senior officials and others to make clear that these actions were crimes and help ensure that ""the American government never tortures again."" 

The 500-plus page report that the Intelligence Committee has prepared for release, a summary of a much more detailed, 6,000-page narrative which will remain secret, includes 200 pages on the interrogation program's history and 20 case studies.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A U.N. human rights expert said a report that the U.S. Senate released on Tuesday revealed a ""clear policy orchestrated at a high level within the Bush administration"" and called for prosecution of U.S. officials who ordered crimes, including torture, against detainees. 
Ben Emmerson, United Nations special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, said senior Bush administration officials who planned and authorized crimes must be prosecuted, along with as CIA and other U.S. government officials who committed torture such as waterboarding. 
""As a matter of international law, the U.S. is legally obliged to bring those responsible to justice,"" Emmerson said in a statement issued in Geneva. ""The U.S. Attorney General is under a legal duty to bring criminal charges against those responsible."" 
The CIA routinely misled the White House and Congress over its harsh interrogation program for terrorism suspects, and its methods, which included waterboarding, were more brutal than the agency acknowledged, a Senate report said on Tuesday. 
Emmerson, a British international lawyer serving in the independent post since 2010, welcomed the belated release of the report, commending the Obama administration ""for resisting domestic pressure to suppress these important findings"". 
""It is now time to take action. The individuals responsible for the criminal conspiracy revealed in today's report must be brought to justice, and must face criminal penalties commensurate with the gravity of their crimes,"" he said. 
International law prohibits granting immunity to public officials who have engaged in acts of torture, he said. 
""The fact that the policies revealed in this report were authorized at a high level within the U.S. government provides no excuse whatsoever. Indeed, it reinforces the need for criminal accountability,"" Emmerson said. 
Torture is an international crime and perpetrators may be prosecuted by any other country to which they might travel, he added. 
The U.N. Human Rights Committee, which reviewed the U.S. record in upholding civil and political rights in March, called for the release of the report then. 
Critics, including independent experts on that U.N. rights panel, say the CIA program set up after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States included harsh interrogation methods that constituted torture banned by international law.

The Republican governor ordered 4 percent in spending cuts as well as a steep $40.7 million reduction in state contributions to its public employees retirement system to save $78.5 million. The remaining $201.5 million would be tapped from several state funds subject to legislative approval. 
State Budget director Shawn Sullivan said in a memo the deficit projection made last month resulted from a lower revenue forecast and expectations of increased expenditures for education, Medicaid and other programs. 
State agencies and officials can appeal the cuts, which would take place at the midpoint of the fiscal 2015 budget, to the governor by Dec. 19. 
Under a plan passed in 2012 that Brownback said would spur economic growth, Kansas began ratcheting down income tax rates through 2018 and eliminating some taxes on business income. 

The subsequent drop in revenue contributed to one-notch downgrades of the state's credit ratings to Aa2 by Moody's Investors Service in April and to AA by Standard & Poor's in August. Both credit ratings agencies said the state had not cut spending deep enough to compensate for the loss in revenue.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Obamacare consultant Jonathan Gruber apologized on Tuesday for remarks in which he referred to ""the stupidity of the American voter"" and told a congressional committee that President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law was not passed in a deceptive manner. 
Gruber, a healthcare economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he had not intended to denigrate the 2010 Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, and played down his role in its development. 
    ""I behaved badly, and I will have to live with that, but my own inexcusable arrogance is not a flaw in the Affordable Care Act,"" Gruber told the House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee. 
Republicans have seized on videos from past years that came to attention in November in which Gruber says the law was written in a ""very tortured way"" to hide new taxes and that voter stupidity helped ensure its passage. The remarks embarrassed the Obama administration and Democratic supporters of the law and provided more fuel for relentless Republican attacks on Obamacare. 
Representative Darrell Issa, the panel's Republican chairman, said Gruber's statements ""were not only an insult to the American people, but revealed a pattern of intentionally misleading the public about the true impact and nature of Obamacare."" 
Gruber also came under attack from the committee's top Democrat, Representative Elijah Cummings, who said the economist's comments ""were irresponsible, incredibly disrespectful and did not reflect reality."" 
Cummings described the hearing as ""political theater"" designed to bolster the Republican effort to undermine the law. 
Gruber rejected efforts to describe him as a leading architect of the law, saying he was paid around $400,000 for providing economic models predicting the impact of different policy options, such as cost estimates for proposed subsidies. 
But Gruber angered Republicans when he declined to provide the total amount he has been paid by federal and state governments for his consulting work, saying he did not recall and lawmakers should ""take it up with my counsel."" 
In addition, Marilyn Tavenner, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service administrator, told lawmakers she erred when she testified to Issa's panel in September that 7.3 million people had signed up for coverage under Obamacare. Those numbers were overstated by about 400,000. 

""It was inexcusable. It should not have happened,"" Tavenner said, adding she did not think anyone in the administration had intended to deceive the public.

The program, which will encourage consumers buying replacement tires to choose low rolling resistance tires, which cost more initially than those with more friction but increase fuel economy and save money on gasoline.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that if 10 percent of replacement tires sold in the United States each year were upgraded to tires with lower rolling resistance, consumers would save more than $200 million in fuel costs and cut carbon pollution by 690,000 tonnes per year.
Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx will announce the program at a White House event on Tuesday featuring a NASCAR stock car and driver, a White House official said.
The program requires a formal rule-making, which the administration wants to finish by 2017.
The administration also plans to highlight tire safety during the next month, working with tire manufacturers, retailers and oil and gas companies to explain how tire inflation, balance, alignment and rotation can prevent crashes.
For example, Bridgestone Americas will offer free tire inspections, and Goodyear will provide free inflation pressure services, the White House said.
About 11,000 U.S. crashes per year are related to tire problems, the White House said.

WASHINGTON/KUWAIT CITY (Reuters) - Despite three failed raids to free U.S. hostages held by militants, the United States will continue to conduct such operations, administration officials indicated, as President Barack Obama grapples with a spate of kidnappings and killings of American citizens.
The latest setback came in a remote area of Yemen early on Saturday, when al Qaeda militants shot and fatally wounded American photo journalist Luke Somers and South African teacher Pierre Korkie during a rescue attempt led by U.S. Special Forces.
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel defended the operation and the intelligence that spurred it.
""I don't think it's a matter of going back and having a review of our process. Our process is about as thorough as there can be. Is it imperfect? Yes. Is there risk? Yes,"" Hagel said on Sunday during a visit to Tactical Base Gamberi in eastern Afghanistan.
""But we start with the fact that we have an American that's being held hostage and that American's life is in danger and that's where we start. And then we proceed from there,"" he said.
Some members of Somers' family have criticized the failed raid.
His British stepmother, Penny Bearman, told the Times newspaper that she was ""quite angry, because if there had not been a rescue attempt, he would still be alive."" She said the family had not been informed of the rescue effort.
U.S. officials said Somers was about to be executed by his captors after they released a video last week threatening to kill him. But Bearman told the Times that previous threats had not been carried out, and she had been hopeful.
An earlier raid in mid-November to free Somers had been unsuccessful, as was a July attempt to rescue American journalist James Foley, held by Islamic State militants in Syria. Foley was later beheaded.
Still, such rescue attempts seem unlikely to stop, given the U.S. government's policy of not paying ransom for captives.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Monday that Obama had no regrets about ordering the mission, and said militants should take it as a sign of his resolve to do everything possible to rescue Americans who are held anywhere.
""Militants or extremist organizations that decide to take the risk of taking an American hostage are put on notice today,"" he told reporters.
HOSTAGE POLICY REVIEW
A review of hostage policy that Obama ordered this summer will not revisit issue of ransom, the White House has said.
""Barack Obama's discovering what a nightmare dealing with hostage problems is - a discovery previously made by Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan,"" said Bruce Riedel, a former senior CIA and White House counter-terrorism official.
""I don't see a lot of room for change in American policy,"" said Riedel, now at the Brookings Institution think tank.
The Foley raid and the first attempt to free Somers failed because the men had been moved before U.S. troops arrived, illustrating the limits of intelligence on captives' whereabouts. Somers and Korkie were shot by their captors when they detected the presence of the approaching Special Forces rescue team, officials said on Saturday.
The attempted rescue operations are a direct result of more than a decade of nearly non-stop raids against militants by elite U.S. forces in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.
""We're more capable now, borne out of 13 years of counter-terrorism,"" a senior U.S. defense official said. ""But I wouldn't describe it as a more aggressive policy. ... the threat (to hostages), I think, is a little bit more pervasive too.""
Sometimes, the raids succeed. In January 2012, U.S. Navy SEALS parachuted into Somalia and rescued an American and a Danish aid worker, killing nine of their kidnappers.

""I think you have to try"" to mount rescues, Riedel said. The message it sends, he said, is ""one, we're not going to pay, and two, the hostage-takers are at great risk.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama slipped into the role of late night talk show host on Monday, nudging Stephen Colbert away from his perch during an appearance on the comedian's satirical program and poking fun at himself in the process. 
""You've been taking a lot of shots at my job, I've decided I'm going to go ahead and take a shot at yours,"" Obama said before sitting down alone behind Colbert's desk. 
""As you know I, Stephen Colbert, have never cared for our president,"" Obama proceeded, pretending to be the comedian. 
""The guy is so arrogant, I bet he talks about himself in the third person,"" he said to laughter and applause. 
The president has appeared regularly on daytime and nighttime talk shows to reach specific constituency groups, including young people, who are a key Colbert demographic. 
In the surprise opening segment, Obama read the remarks that were supposedly prepared for Colbert while flippant commentary appeared on the screen next to him, drawing howls from the audience. 
""Young people don't watch real news shows like this one,"" Obama quipped about ""The Colbert Report,"" which follows the format of a traditional news program. 
""They watch comedy shows. And I just don't see the president going on one of those. They're beneath his dignity."" 
The show reverted to its typical question-and-answer format once Colbert returned to the stage. Colbert tried to get Obama to confirm one of the numbers from the nuclear launch codes to which the president always has access. Obama demurred. 
He pushed Obama to rate himself as a great or ""the greatest"" president. Obama demurred again. 
On policy matters, Obama repeated his stance that approval of TransCanada Corp's controversial Keystone XL pipeline from Canada would be based on whether it would exacerbate climate change. He noted the project would not create many jobs. 
When Colbert highlighted the president's positive job creation record, he joked that Obama had provided a lot of employment for secretaries of defense. 
""That's boosted our numbers a little bit,"" Obama replied, appearing unamused. 
Under pressure, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel recently announced he was stepping down and Obama has nominated former Pentagon official Ash Carter to take his place. 

If confirmed, Carter would be the fourth person to serve in the role under Obama.

146,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2014 05:10PM ET</span>",State lawmakers launch gun control coalition,"By Lacey Johnson 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - State lawmakers have launched a nationwide non-partisan coalition to combat gun violence, in part because the Congress has failed to reform gun laws, members of the group said on Monday. 
Some 200 lawmakers from 50 states have joined the alliance, American State Legislators for Gun Violence Prevention, said the group's founder, Democratic New York State Assembly member Brian Kavanagh. 
Kavanagh told a news conference the group would focus on state-level gun control reforms, including the prevention of interstate gun trafficking and tightening background checks on buyers. 
Congress has ""failed in its responsibility"" to prevent gun violence, said Jose Rodriguez, a Democratic state senator from Texas. 
""We can't continue in the same path that we've been in as a country,"" he said. 
President Barack Obama had vowed to curb gun violence after a 20-year-old shooter killed 26 people, mostly children, at a Connecticut school in 2012. But the Senate rejected his proposal for wider background checks for gun buyers. 
Lawmakers from eight states were at the news conference, including Virginia, Alabama, New Hampshire and Kansas. The only Republican lawmaker was state Representative Barbara Bollier from Kansas. 
""We are a diverse group from red and blue states, and I am convinced our collective action will have an impact,"" said state Representative Stacey Newman, a Democrat from Missouri. 
The group has not released information on its preliminary donors, but Kavanagh said fundraising efforts were under way. Members are scheduled to hold their first meeting on Tuesday. 
The Brady Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence said last year that states had led the way in passing gun-control laws. Eight states, headed by California, enacted major gun reforms since the Connecticut killings, it said. 
Voters in Washington state last month also approved legislation to expand background checks for gun buyers. 
The National Institute for Money in State Politics, in Helena, Montana, said last year that fewer than 10 percent of gun control measures introduced in state legislatures after mass shootings in 2012 became law. 

Opponents of gun control outspent gun control advocates in the 2011-12 election cycle by about $800,000 to $21,000, institute figures show. More than half the anti-gun-control contributions were from the National Rifle Association, the powerful gun rights lobby.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Joe Barton will introduce a bill on Tuesday to lift the 40-year ban on exports of crude oil, but the measure has almost no chance of passing due to lawmaker concerns about fuel prices and costs to refiners. 
Barton, a Republican from Texas, will introduce a bill to lift the export ban Congress passed in the 1970s after the Arab oil embargo led to fears of fuel shortages, an aide said. 
The lawmaker will introduce the measure ahead of a hearing later this week by the House of Representatives subcommittee on energy and power on whether the export restriction makes sense amid the domestic drilling boom. 
""The Congressman is planning to drop his bill tomorrow ... and he hopes the timing will make it a centerpiece piece of conversation at Thursday's hearing,"" the Barton aide said. 
Barton, a member of the committee, believes lifting the ban would spark the economy, create hundreds of thousands of jobs and help lower gasoline prices. 
A spokeswoman for the committee said there are many factors to consider on the export ban ""and we welcome Rep. Barton's and all members' ideas and contributions to this debate as we move forward."" 
The bill would also require the Department of Energy to report to Congress on the appropriate size and composition of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
The drilling boom has led to a glut of light crude along the Gulf Coast refining hub. The United State has more crude in the SPR than required under global agreements and could sell some of the sweet crude to markets in Asia and Europe without any risk to energy security, analysts have said. 
Barton could reintroduce the bill next year, but it would still face an uphill battle because many Republican lawmakers have not come out in support of crude exports. Some large oil refiners fear that lifting the restriction would increase costs and say they can retool their plants to use more light crude. 

In the Senate, incoming energy committee chairman Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, is the most vocal supporter of relaxing the crude oil ban. Early in her term, she will likely work to persuade the Obama administration to relax the ban. If the administration does not act, she may try to introduce legislation, but it is uncertain whether she would have the 60 votes necessary to pass such a measure.

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Texas has asked the White House for hundreds of millions of dollars illegal immigration has cost the state, Governor-elect Greg Abbott said on Monday, blaming President Barack Obama for not doing enough to secure the border. 
Abbott, a Republican who takes office next month, met Obama last week shortly after he filed a lawsuit on behalf of states suing the administration over its executive order that eased the threat of deportation for millions of immigrants. 
At a news conference in Austin, Abbott said he made the reimbursement request to two Cabinet members and a member of the president's staff, without offering further details. 
""We understand that this is a federal responsibility and we expect the federal government to step up and fulfill its responsibility to secure the border,"" Abbott, who is currently the state's attorney general, told reporters. 
Last summer's deployment of more police and National Guard troops on the border with Mexico has accounted for about a quarter of the state's estimated spending on immigration measures. U.S. Democrats and the Mexican government criticized Texas' deployment as being more political than practical. 
Democrats have cited data showing the flow of immigrants was slowing before the National Guard deployment started, that more U.S. Border Patrol agents have been assigned to the border. They also say members of the National Guard do not have the power to arrest, raising questions about what they are doing. 
Texas lawmakers estimate the state has spent at least $500 million to meet immigration challenges, Abbott said, adding he has received no answers from the Obama administration on the state's call for federal funds. 
Abbott said he also talked to the president about expanding the capacity of the Port of Houston, one of the largest in the country in terms of imports and exports.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Monday Klain was hired as a ""special government employee,"" a classification that brings consultants on board for a maximum term of 130 days. 
Klain's first day was Oct. 22, meaning his term will expire by March 1. A lawyer who previously served as chief of staff to vice presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore, Klain plans to return to his job at Revolution LLC, a venture capital firm owned by AOL co-founder Steve Case. 
The White House will evaluate whether it needs to replace Klain when he leaves, Earnest said. 
The White House was criticized for scrambling after a Liberian man died of Ebola in a Dallas hospital. Two nurses there had contracted the disease, and officials had to trace hundreds of people who had crossed their paths. 
Klain, lauded by Democrats for his ability to coordinate complex projects, was brought in as Ebola ""czar"" as the White House sought to show it was on top of the crisis. His lack of medical expertise made him a controversial pick. 
At the time, the White House said the job would be temporary. Klain told MSNBC in a November interview that he would be returning to private life. 
He was cited as a potential replacement for chief of staff Denis McDonough, should there have been a staff shake-up after November elections. But there is no indication that McDonough plans to leave soon. 
Klain has worked mainly behind the scenes, stepping out to eulogize a U.S. surgeon who died in November from Ebola after working in his native Sierra Leone. The United States hasn't had a known case of the disease since then. 
Under Klain's leadership, the government tightened screening procedures and pushed back against calls for travel bans. It also expanded the number of U.S. hospitals able to treat Ebola patients to 35 from three. 
Obama has stressed that Congress needs to approve $6.18 billion in emergency funding to help fight the outbreak in West Africa, the worst ever recorded with 17,111 confirmed, suspected or probable cases, according to the World Health Organization. 

The fate of that request will become clear this week as Congress rushes to meet a Dec. 11 deadline for funding the government.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder will announce on Monday revisions to federal law enforcement guidelines that are designed to limit profiling and set an example for local police, according to a Justice Department official. 
The new rules expand upon guidelines issued in 2003 under the Bush administration that prevented profiling based on race or ethnicity to now include gender, national origin, religion, sexual orientation and gender identity. 
A special carve-out was made, however, for certain agencies under U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 
The announcement comes after weeks of racially-charged protests following two state grand jury decisions not to indict local police officers over fatal incidents involving black men in Ferguson, Missouri and New York. 
Holder will lead a conference call with local law enforcement leaders on Monday to encourage them to adopt the federal guidelines, the Justice Department official said. 
Holder, who has said he will leave his post early next year, is adamant about making improved race relations a major part of his legacy. He has recently pressed for the guidelines to be expanded by the time he leaves office, the Justice Department official said. 
""Particularly in light of certain recent incidents we've seen at the local level and the widespread concerns about trust in the criminal justice process which so many have raised throughout the nation, it's imperative that we take every possible action to institute strong and sound policing practices,"" Holder said in a statement. 
The revised guidance closes an earlier loophole provided for any federal law enforcement activity that could fall under the purpose of national security. Now only certain Department of Homeland security agents will receive that cover. 
Those screening travelers at airports, guarding U.S. borders and protecting national leaders in the Secret Service will be exempted from the guidelines. 
The American Civil Liberties Union said these exceptions mean the national security loophole is not sufficiently closed. 
The ACLU's Washington legislative director Laura Murphy said the exceptions are ""distressing, particularly because Latinos and religious minorities are disproportionately affected."" 
The Department of Homeland Security said in a fact sheet that the exceptions were made because of the unique nature of the agency's mission, ""most notably in protecting our borders and securing our skies."" 

The Justice Department will formally announce the new guidelines through a memo to be published at an unknown time on Monday.

An earlier raid in mid-November to free Somers also was unsuccessful - he wasn't present when U.S. and Yemeni forces arrived - as was a July attempt to rescue American journalist James Foley, held by Islamic State in Syria. Foley was later beheaded. 
Yet however high-risk, the increasingly frequent rescue attempts seem unlikely to stop now, particularly as Obama holds fast to a policy of refusing to pay ransom for captives. 
A review of hostage policy that Obama ordered this summer will not include the issue of ransom, the White House has said. 
That review was begun ""in light of the increasing number of U.S. citizens taken hostage by terrorist groups overseas and the extraordinary nature of recent hostage cases,"" National Security Council spokesman Alistair Baskey said. 
""Barack Obama's discovering what a nightmare dealing with hostage problems is - a discovery previously made by Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan,"" said Bruce Riedel, a former senior CIA and White House counter-terrorism official. 
""I don't see a lot of room for change in American policy,"" said Riedel, now at the Brookings Institution think tank. 
The Foley raid and the first attempt to free Somers failed because they apparently had been moved before U.S. troops arrived, illustrating the limits of intelligence on captives' whereabouts. Somers and Korkie were shot by their captors when they detected the presence of the approaching Special Forces rescue team, officials said on Saturday. 
The stepped-up rescue operations are a direct result of more than a decade of nearly non-stop raids against militants by elite U.S. forces in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. 
""We're more capable now, borne out of 13 years of counter-terrorism,"" a senior U.S. defense official said. ""But I wouldn't describe it as a more aggressive policy. ... the threat (to hostages), I think, is a little bit more pervasive too."" 
Sometimes the raids succeed. In January 2012, U.S. Navy SEALS parachuted into Somalia and rescued an American and a Danish aid worker, killing nine of their kidnappers. 

""I think you have to try"" to mount rescues, Riedel said. The message it sends, he said, is ""one, we're not going to pay and two, the hostage-takers are at great risk.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. Congress plan to renew their attacks on President Barack Obama and his signature healthcare plan on Tuesday when they grill a consultant who said ""the stupidity of the American voter"" helped ensure the law's passage. 
Representative Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said panel members will ask consultant Jonathan Gruber about possible deceptions and a lack of transparency in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. 
Republicans have seized on videos in which Gruber, a healthcare economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an Obamacare consultant, says the law was written in a ""very tortured way"" to hide taxes, and passed thanks to ""the stupidity of the American voter."" 
Issa said the public deserved an explanation from Gruber at Tuesday's hearing. 
""If you can't trust what he says, and what he says he'll do, to get votes and trick the American people into voting for something, then can you trust his analytics?"" Issa said of Gruber. 
""It is our job to see that the administration is working to run the country and that they are reporting honestly their successes and their failures,"" he told Reuters. 
Republicans say Gruber's comments show the administration deceived Americans as it pushed the law through Congress. Americans For Prosperity, a group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers, used Gruber's comments to attack Democrat Mary Landrieu in the runoff for the Louisiana Senate race. 
Democrats have distanced themselves from Gruber. Obama referred to him as ""some adviser who never worked on our staff"" who ""expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with."" 
Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight panel, called Gruber's comments ""very unfortunate."" He said he would use the hearing to talk about the benefits of Obamacare. 
""To spend hours upon hours of time trying to get (Gruber) to explain himself, to me it does not insure one more person, it does not help heal anybody, and it doesn't do anybody any good. We're wasting our time,"" Cummings said. 
Republicans also want to question an administration official about inflated enrollment figures for Obamacare. 

Marilyn Tavenner, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service administrator, testified to Issa's panel in September that 7.3 million people had signed up for coverage, but those numbers were too high by about 400,000. She has been called backon Tuesday to explain what happened.

NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy handily won a Louisiana U.S. Senate runoff election on Saturday, capping big wins for his party in the Nov. 4 midterms at the expense of one of the chamber's last remaining southern Democrats. 
Cassidy, whose victory swells the ranks of Republicans in the Senate to 54, defeated Mary Landrieu, a three-term incumbent who last month pushed hard for a Senate vote on approving the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada's oil sands to the U.S. Gulf Coast that came up just short. 
Cassidy, 57, ran a disciplined campaign focused on linking Landrieu to President Barack Obama, who is deeply unpopular among whites in Louisiana. With all precincts reporting, he defeated Landrieu by just under 12 percentage points, uncertified results showed. 
""This victory happened because people in Louisiana voted for a government which serves us but does not tell us what to do,"" Cassidy told a jubilant crowd in Baton Rouge. 
Cassidy becomes the ninth Republican to capture a previously Democratic seat this year in a runoff held because no candidate secured a majority in the Nov. 4 open primary. 
Landrieu, 59, had been fighting to remain one of only two Democratic senators from the southeastern U.S. - a party stronghold a generation ago - after losses last month by Democratic incumbents in Arkansas and North Carolina. 
""It has been nothing but a joy to serve this state for over 34 years,"" Landrieu said before supporters in New Orleans, referring to a political career that began in the Louisiana state Legislature in 1980. 
The top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Landrieu campaigned on her clout, a message complicated by her party's loss of Senate control in last month's midterms and her failed pipeline efforts. 
Days before the runoff she seized on allegations that Cassidy, a medical doctor, falsified some time sheets and failed to file others for a part-time Louisiana State University hospital job. Cassidy has denied the allegations, which the school says it is reviewing. 
Landrieu's difficulties were compounded by the scant financial support she received from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and outside groups ahead of the runoff. 

Cassidy had no similar problems. Ads supporting him and critical of Landrieu saturated the airwaves, including one 30-second anti-Landrieu video released by Ending Spending Action Fund in late November featuring nine separate images of Obama.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel formally announced his candidacy for a second term on Saturday in a speech that highlighted his successful effort to push through a minimum wage increase in the city. 
While mostly avoiding specific references to the achievements of his first term, Emanuel expressed pride in a bill that the city council passed this week to bump up the minimum wage gradually to $13 an hour in 2019 from the current $8.25 an hour. 
""Washington wouldn't do it. Springfield couldn't do it. But here in Chicago, we did it,"" Emanuel, a former White House chief of staff under President Barack Obama, said, referring to failed efforts to increase the minimum wage at the federal and state levels. 
Emanuel, a Democrat who faces nine challengers in the Feb. 24 election, also promoted a scholarship program that will provide free tuition in the city's community college system to public high school graduates with a 3.0 grade point average. 
His first term drew national attention for what became the largest mass public school closing in U.S. history, and scandals involving a traffic ticket program that an investigation by the Chicago Tribune found was likely rigged to ensnare nearly 80,000 drivers. He has refused to refund $7.7 million the program collected during that period. 
The audience of about 250 people included local aldermen, state officials, U.S. Representative Luis Gutierrez, and officials from a local plumbers union. 
Outside the event, groups of protesters chanted and held signs that characterized Emanuel as a friend to Wall Street and an enemy of the middle class. Two men were dressed as dollar bills while one woman held a sign that said ""Rich People 4 Rahm."" 
""He's squeezing money from working class families with the red light cameras, the parking fees. We're not taking this anymore,"" said Byron Sigcho, 31, a teacher. 
In his speech, Emanuel characterized the middle class as ""squeezed"" and said economic growth was ""not being shared equally."" He said the solution was his minimum wage hike. 
Zerlina Smith, 38, said the school closings show Emanuel has ""de-invested in the black community."" 

Alderman Bob Fioretti, who is running against Emanuel, said in a statement that the mayor's policies ""have created two Chicagos and no amount of campaign cash or TV ads can change that fact.""

WASHINGTON, D.C. (Reuters) - Thousands of mourners gathered in downtown Washington on Saturday to bid farewell to Marion Barry, known as the capital district's ""mayor for life"" after serving four terms in office between 1979 and 1999 that were marred by scandal. 
""He never stopped working. He never stopped serving ... and that's why the people loved him,"" said civil rights activist Reverend Jesse Jackson, who delivered Barry's eulogy. 
""His name is on the honor roll of freedom fighters,"" said Jackson. ""The man helped emancipate Washington."" 
The four-hour event at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center marked the third and final day of memorial services for Barry, who remained a popular politician despite a crack cocaine conviction in 1990 and other scandals. 
""Marion Barry understood that our lives are marked by sin, as well as virtues,"" said Rev. Willie Wilson, who made opening remarks following a public viewing on Saturday morning. 
Barry, 78, died on Nov. 23 due to complications from heart problems. He was a city councilman when he died, representing impoverished Ward 8. 
When Barry first became mayor, he focused resources on poor neighborhoods, government contracts for black businesses and jobs on the city payroll. 
""I grew up on Marion Barry. I was able to see his effect on Washington from my early years,"" said Yusef Bey, 63, a Washington native who traveled from Baltimore for Saturday's memorial. ""I love the man and his work. He was an example for humanity - what can be done."" 
Washington's current mayor, Vincent Gray, credited Barry with helping to build a black middle class and put the city's finances under control. 
Barry's third consecutive term was sullied by open talk of womanizing, drinking and drug use. In his autobiography Barry said he was fueled in those days by a ""mix of power, attraction, alcohol, sex and drugs."" 
In 1990, Barry, a married man, was captured on a hidden video camera smoking crack with a former girlfriend. At the time, the city was plagued by a crack epidemic and drug-related homicides. 
Hundreds of people turned out on the streets of southeast Washington on Friday to pay tribute to Barry as his casket was transported on a horse-drawn carriage for a memorial service at the Temple of Praise church, where he had worshipped. 

Barry was buried at Congressional Cemetery in Southeast Washington in a private ceremony following Saturday's event. He was married four times and had one son.

Biden said that while the United States and Israel have tactical disagreements, Washington remained fully dedicated to Israel's security. 
""We will not let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon - period,"" he said. ""End of discussion. Not on our watch.""

NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Louisiana voters voted on Saturday in a runoff election that opinion polls indicate will expand Republicans' majority in the U.S. Senate at the expense of one of the chamber's last remaining southern Democrats. 
Republican U.S. Representative Bill Cassidy is challenging three-term incumbent Mary Landrieu, who is fighting to remain one of only two Democratic senators from the southeastern U.S. - a party stronghold a generation ago - after losses last month by Democratic incumbents in Arkansas and North Carolina. 
Cassidy has run a disciplined campaign focused on linking Landrieu to President Barack Obama, who is deeply unpopular among whites in Louisiana, and is leading by more than 20 percentage points, according to a RealClearPolitics average of polls in recent weeks. 
""It's a campaign that has been very methodical and careful and doesn't do stupid things,"" said John Couvillon, a Louisiana pollster working mostly for Republicans. 
If victorious, Cassidy would be the ninth Republican to capture a previously Democratic seat this year. The runoff is being held because no candidate secured a majority in the Nov. 4 open primary. 
In the Landrieu stronghold of New Orleans, Brooks Young, a political independent working at a solar energy firm, said he voted for Cassidy. 
""We need a change,"" said Young, 26. ""Mary Landrieu's been in there for a long time."" 
Landrieu, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has campaigned on her clout, a message complicated by her party's loss of Senate control. 
Her campaign has also been weakened by her recent failed push to win Senate approval of the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada's oil sands to the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Landrieu's difficulties have been compounded by the scant financial support she has received from outside groups and Democratic campaign committees ahead of the runoff. 
Days before the election, she told the Washington Post she felt the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee had ""walked away from the race."" 

Cassidy has had no similar problems. Ads supporting him and critical of Landrieu have saturated the airwaves, including one 30-second anti-Landrieu video released by Ending Spending Action Fund in late November featuring nine separate images of Obama.

Kerry's spokeswoman said he called Senator Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, to urge her to take foreign policy considerations into account when choosing when to publish. 
Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement that Kerry repeated his support for the release of the findings and ""made clear that the timing is of course her choice."" 
Earlier, sources aware of the call had said Kerry expressed concern that the release of a 500-page summary of the report could complicate tense foreign policy issues being addressed by the State Department. 
One source said one concern was that Islamic militant groups holding U.S. hostages would execute them once the report is released. At least three Americans, including one woman, are currently believed to be held by such groups. 
Another source said Kerry told Feinstein that publication could complicate U.S. relations with some countries in the Middle East which are working with the United States against Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria and other groups. 
A source familiar with the phone call said Kerry did not explicitly ask Feinstein to postpone the report's release. 
There was no immediate response to queries to Feinstein's office and it was unclear whether she would publish the report as had been expected early next week. 
The report, which took the committee's Democratic staff years to compile, charts the activities of a CIA program launched under President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon. 
It included using coercive interrogation practices condemned by rights groups as torture, including the simulated drowning technique ""waterboarding,"" on detained militant suspects. The practices were banned by President Barack Obama. 
Congressional investigators and Administration officials have been wrangling for months to ensure the maximum amount of information is released but that it not endanger intelligence operations or U.S. relations. 
Tentative plans had been made to release the summary along with lengthy critical responses from both the CIA and Senate Committee Republicans, who did not participate extensively in the committee's investigation.  
Some Obama administration critics say the CIA and White House had been trying to delay the release until after control of the Senate shifts in January to Republicans, some of whom have fiercely criticized the investigation. 

White House National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said, however, that President Barack Obama wanted the report declassified as soon as possible.

162,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2014 05:52PM ET</span>",Wisconsin Republicans plan to push right-to-work bill in January,"By Mark Guarino 
(Reuters) - Wisconsin Republicans say they plan to start the new year by introducing a right-to-work measure that would prohibit private sector labor unions from requiring workers to pay dues. 
Republicans control both sides of the Wisconsin Legislature and the governor's mansion, leaving a clear path for right-to-work legislation that is already law in 24 states, including Michigan and Indiana, where laws were approved in 2012. 
Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald on Thursday said in a statement that the legislature ""simply cannot avoid engaging in an open debate"" about right-to-work legislation and wanted to determine the most appropriate version for Wisconsin. 
Fitzgerald said the legislature owed it to residents to have a public policy discussion on the issue. 
Supporters of right-to-work legislation say it promotes the individual liberty of workers by giving them the choice of whether or not to join a union, and perhaps more importantly, whether to pay membership dues. 
Opponents say the legislation weakens union solidarity and will lead to lower wages for all workers. 
""It's a power grab,"" Phil Neuenfeldt, president of the Wisconsin AFL-CIO, said on Friday in a telephone interview. 
Neuenfeldt said that a right-to-work law would allow employers to divide workers against each other and make it easier to get agreements passed that have lower wages over time. 
Republicans took a majority in the Wisconsin legislature in the 2010 elections, when Republican Governor Scott Walker won his first term and approved laws in 2011 restricting collective bargaining for most public sector unions except police and fire amid protests from Democrats and unions in Madison. 
Walker has made public statements since then that right-to-work is not a priority. 
But foundation has been laid to push the legislation when the next Wisconsin legislative session begins in early January. 
Wisconsin Right to Work, a nonprofit, was launched on Monday to promote right-to-work efforts and on Friday launched a radio ad campaign, it said on its Facebook site.

Oil refiners, and many manufacturers and state governments oppose the Jones Act, saying the requirement increases costs by blocking shipping by cheaper foreign-built and foreign-flagged vessels. 
The Department of Homeland Security issued a rare waiver of the act in 2012 when superstorm Sandy led to fuel shortages at gas stations on the East Coast, allowing foreign vessels to bring fuel from Gulf Coast refiners. But the act has been blamed for causing bottlenecks, including a shortage of rock salt for New Jersey roads during a recent severe winter storm. 
McCain, an Arizona Republican and the incoming chairman of the Senate's Armed Services Committee, estimates that consumers could save about $1 billion annually if the Jones Act was lifted. He introduced a bill in 2010 to repeal it but estimated soon after that he probably only had about 20 votes in the 100-member chamber.   
He said despite tough opposition it is a fight that will win one day. ""It's one of these things you just propose amendments to bills and encourage hearings and sooner or later the dam breaks,"" McCain said after a speech at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. 
""But I have to tell you ... the power of this maritime lobby is as powerful as anybody or any organization I have run up against in my political career. All I can do is appeal to the patron saint of lost causes and keep pressing and pressing and sooner or later you have to succeed,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Friday nominated veteran defense expert Ashton Carter as his defense secretary, a job that will require him to tackle messy wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan and try to fend off potentially damaging budget cuts. 
In Carter, Obama chose a policy expert who has worked for 11 defense secretaries. The 60-year-old Carter pronounced himself ready to give Obama honest, strategic advice once he clears U.S. Senate confirmation, which should move quickly early next year. 
He replaces Chuck Hagel, who had privately expressed frustration with the administration's strategy on Iraq and Syria and with his lack of influence over the policy, which was driven by the White House. 
Hagel did not attend the White House nominating ceremony, which is customary for departing Cabinet members. He issued a statement praising the choice of Carter as his successor. 
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the president did not feel snubbed, although he said Obama wanted Hagel to be there. ""That was a decision that Secretary Hagel made and certainly it's a decision that's respected by everybody here at the White House,"" he said. 
FENDING OFF BUDGET CUTS 
Officials have said Hagel, who resigned under pressure, had not always spoken up at meetings and seemed out of his depth on the Middle East. In remarks at the nomination ceremony, Carter told Obama: ""I pledge to you my most candid strategic advice."" 
Apart from helping formulate and implement the military campaign against Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria and wind down the U.S. presence in Afghanistan, Carter's big task will be averting across-the-board budget cuts due in 2016. 
""His biggest problem coming in will be how to persuade Congress to remove the threat of sequestration in 2016,"" Frank Kendall, the Pentagon chief arms buyer, said at a luncheon. 
He expected Carter, who if confirmed will be Obama's fourth defense secretary, to support ongoing reforms of the way the Pentagon buys weapons, and a drive to invest in technologies to ensure continued military superiority. 
Republican Senator John McCain, who will oversee Carter's confirmation hearing as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee from January, called him ""a highly competent, experienced, hard-working and committed public servant."" 

But McCain, who has complained of Obama's ""micromanaging"" of security policy, said: ""He will likely have limited influence over the tight circle around the president who apparently control the entire strategic decision-making process.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In an unusual move, the U.S. Department of Justice late Thursday revised a nearly 10-month-old press release about the resolution of a Medicare overbilling probe, after one of the settling parties threatened to sue it for defamation over the original release. 
Sanjay Puri, the owner of Washington-area medical billing company Engage Medical Inc, was unhappy that the Feb. 18 release from the U.S. Attorney's office in Maryland did not make explicit that he had denied liability in agreeing to settle. 
That press release had already been revised once, after Puri had objected to the first version which didn't address his liability at all - which the actual settlement documents do. 
The changes do not affect Puri's and Engage's agreement to pay $544,500 toward the $3.34 million settlement, which also covered several doctors and other firms. 
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office declined to comment on the new release. 
Puri, who is also head of a U.S.-India political action committee, in an interview said he believed the Feb. 18 press release mischaracterized the settlement, and hurt his personal and professional reputation. 
""The political world also is very, very sensitive to these kinds of information,"" he said. ""People look at you a little differently."" 
Puri said he agreed to settle to put the investigation behind him. 
The revised press release came as government enforcers have faced questions about whether they let some civil defendants get off too easy by allowing them to settle probes without admitting wrongdoing, and in some cases denying the charges. 
But some defendants argue they would otherwise have little incentive to settle, and would instead fight charges in court. 
""Mr. Puri was committed to clearing his name, and we explained that all options were on the table,"" his lawyer, Adam Lurie of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, said.   
Andy Jackson, a lawyer at Jones Day who defends cases over government contractor fraud and overbilling, said it is common for such cases to be resolved without admissions. He said he could not remember another instance of the government revisiting a similar press release.

166,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2014 07:22PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Republicans prepare 2015 immigration legislation,"By Richard Cowan 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans, outraged with President Barack Obama for easing deportations of millions of undocumented residents, plan legislation in 2015 strengthening the U.S.-Mexican border to discourage illegal immigration. 
The move, likely to come early next year according to House Republican leadership aides, may lead to other steps the House of Representatives could contemplate to repair parts of U.S. immigration law. 
When legislation materializes, it would follow a year and half of congressional inactivity in the aftermath of the passage of a sprawling Senate bill backed by Obama but killed by the House. 
""I think there is the realization...that this issue is not going away,"" said Republican Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, who has labored to write broad immigration legislation. 
House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul likely will oversee the effort, according to leadership aides. McCaul has pushed legislation imposing tough standards for border apprehensions. 
Given the House's rejection of the Senate's work in 2013, a strategy is emerging for 2015 to have the House take the lead in the hope of making better progress. 
The 2013 Senate bill's pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented residents was a lightning rod for opposition. 
""I want it to start in the House,"" said Republican Senator John McCain, a leading immigration reform proponent. 
McCain said bills improving border security, establishing an online system for companies to check their workers' immigration status and expanding visas for high-tech foreign workers could be first out of the gate. The latter two are important to U.S. businesses. 
Senior House Republican aides said it was unclear what bills might move next year beyond border security. 
Republicans hope to gain more control of the immigration debate as they will hold majorities in the House and Senate for the first time since 2006. 
They need to improve their standing with Hispanic-American voters as the party strives to capture the White House in 2016. 
DIFFICULTIES ABOUND 
Passing tougher immigration measures will be difficult, though, as Democratic votes will be needed. 
Obama warned business leaders this week that ""it's going to be hard, I think, for me and for other Democrats"" to support piecemeal legislation that deals with the concerns of business but does not address undocumented Americans. 
One leading Democrat on immigration, Representative Zoe Lofgren, was asked if she could support a Republican border security bill, for example. 
""It depends on what it is,"" Lofgren said, adding Republican Representative ""Steve King wants to do a (border) wall with electrified wire...I don't think that's a winning vote."" 
Ultimately, Republicans must address the approximately 12 million undocumented residents living in the United States for extended periods, McCain and Diaz-Balart said. 
Many Republicans argue that allowing them to stay in the U.S. rewards law-breakers. 
Meanwhile, House Republican leadership is more conservative with the recent election of Representative Steve Scalise to the third-ranking position. Scalise opposes giving legal status to undocumented residents. 
Furthermore, the House immigration debate could unfold as a seasonal spike of illegal migration from Central America gets underway. Last summer's arrival of tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors stoked tensions between Republicans and immigration advocates. 
For legislation to succeed in 2015, ""a lot of things have to line up and they're not lined up now,"" said one Republican congressman who asked not to be identified.

167,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2014 06:21PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Pentagon to review Raytheon GPS ground system after cost spike,"By Andrea Shalal 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Thursday said it had ordered a review of Raytheon Co's work on a new ground control system for Global Positioning System satellites after an Air Force-ordered restructuring drove the program's cost significantly higher. 
The current contract value is $1.6 billion, according to Air Force officials, which marks an increase of over 80 percent from the initial contract value of $886 million. 
Frank Kendall, the Pentagon's chief arms buyer, on Tuesday ordered a ""deep dive"" review, starting in January, of the next-generation GPS Operational Control System (OCX) that Raytheon is developing, according to his spokeswoman, Maureen Schumann. 
Kendall told an investor conference in New York on Tuesday that most U.S. weapons programs were within 2-3 percent of their cost targets, but he was keeping an eye on one program that was ""significantly over."" He did not name the program. 
Schumann told Reuters on Thursday that Kendall was referring to the Raytheon OCX program. 
The U.S. Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center awarded Raytheon a contract in February 2010 to develop the hardware and software needed to control U.S. GPS satellites and ensure the security of their signals, but the program has run into technical challenges and cost increases. Including options, the total contract was initially valued at $1.5 billion. 
The Air Force this summer restructured the OCX program, increasing the value of the base contract by 80.5 percent from $886 million to $1.6 billion, and delaying its completion by two years to 2018. 
A spokeswoman for the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center confirmed the contract value was now $1.6 billion, and said it included options for further work. She did not spell out the percentage increase or the value of the options. 
 Raytheon said it had worked closely with the Air Force to modify the cost and schedule baseline and incorporate new Department of Defense (DOD) cyber security requirements. 
""The revised contract reflects the complexity of implementing the DOD's most rigorous cyber requirements coupled with improvements to our systems engineering and software development approach,"" Matt Gilligan, Raytheon's GPS-OCX program, said in a statement. 

Gilligan said the company had successfully completed four of five exercises to prove the system's readiness for launch, and is due to start formal qualification tests in early 2015.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, facing a slump in public approval of his job performance, will take his first formal step in making his case for a second term when he launches his re-election campaign on Saturday at a film studio on the city's West Side. 
Emanuel is expected to lay out plans for creating jobs in the third-largest U.S. city and improving high school graduation rates in Chicago, campaign spokesman Steve Mayberry said in an emailed statement. 
A former chief of staff for President Barack Obama, Emanuel faces nine challengers in Chicago's nonpartisan mayoral election on Feb. 24. 
Chicago Alderman Bob Fioretti and Cook County Commissioner Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia are among the better-known challengers. If no one receives 50 percent of the vote, there would be runoff election April 7 with the top two candidates. 
Fioretti on Thursday called for five debates, including at least one in areas of the city where Emanuel is less popular, and said the election was ""pivotal in deciding the future"" of Chicago. 
Earlier this week, Garcia questioned why Emanuel supported raising the minimum wage to $13 an hour only by 2019. The City Council approved Emanuel's proposal on Tuesday. 
""For a mayor who is fond of saying he makes tough decisions, I think we have a right to ask why he did not make an easy one,"" Garcia said. 
Emanuel's popularity took a hit when he launched the largest batch of public school closings in U.S. history in 2013. He also has been criticized for an automated red light ticketing program that an investigation by the Chicago Tribune found was likely rigged for a time to ensnare nearly 80,000 drivers. He has refused to refund $7.7 million the program collected during that period. 
Emanuel led other candidates in a recent poll of likely voters with 44 percent, followed by Garcia and Fioretti at about 15 percent each, with 18 percent undecided. The survey of 800 likely voters from Nov. 23-25 by San Francisco firm David Binder Research had a 3.5 percentage point margin of error. 
The Binder poll shows Emanuel with a likability rating of 52 percent. That contrasts with a Chicago Tribune poll in August that found an approval rating of 35 percent.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Potential Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton said on Thursday she was pleased the U.S. Department of Justice was investigating the recent deaths of unarmed black men in incidents with police. 
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said on Wednesday the Department of Justice would launch a civil rights investigation into the chokehold death of Eric Garner in the New York City borough of Staten Island in July. 
There is also a federal probe into the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri, in August. Grand juries in both cases decided not to indict the officers involved, sparking protests. 
""Our hearts are breaking, and we are asking ourselves: 'Aren't these our sons, aren't these our brothers?'"" Clinton told the Massachusetts Conference for Women in Boston. 
""I'm very pleased the Department of Justice will be investigating what happened in Ferguson, what happened in Staten Island. Those families, those communities, and the country, deserve a full and fair accounting as well as whatever substantive reforms are necessary to ensure equality, justice and respect for every citizen."" 
She said the events in Ferguson and Staten Island highlighted ""some hard truths about race and justice in America."" 
""Despite all the progress that we have made together, African-Americans, particularly African-American men, are still more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with a crime, and serve longer prison terms."" 
""I personally hope these tragedies give us an opportunity to come together to find balance again,"" she said. 
Clinton, who lost the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 to Barack Obama and served as his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, is considered her party's front-runner if she runs again for the White House. She has said she will make up her mind early next year.

170,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2014 03:00PM ET</span>",Boehner vows to avoid government shutdown with help from Democrats ,"By David Lawder 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Overriding objections from some conservative Republicans, U.S. House Speaker John Boehner vowed on Thursday to plow ahead with a spending bill that averts a government shutdown while keeping some budget ""leverage"" over President Barack Obama's immigration order. 
Boehner said he expected the bill, which provides full funding for all government agencies except the Department of Homeland Security through September 2015, to pass next week with some votes from Democrats, just ahead of a Dec. 11 deadline. 
The department, which controls the agencies that would implement Obama's plan to allow millions of undocumented immigrants to stay and work in the United States, would get only a short-term funding extension, likely until sometime in February, Republican lawmakers said. 
At that time, Republicans will be in a better position to restrict spending on immigration-related items since they take control of the Senate and expand their majority in the House of Representatives in the new year following the November midterm elections. 
""We think this is the most practical way to fight the president's action,"" Boehner told a news conference. ""And we listened to our members."" 
Obama's plan, announced last month as an executive order, would let up to 4.7 million of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States stay without threat of deportation. Republicans have criticized it as an overreach of powers that amounts to an amnesty for lawbreakers. 
The House passed a largely symbolic measure on Thursday that effectively declares Obama's action illegal. It passed 219-197 on a mostly party-line vote, but Democrats who still control the Senate have no plans to consider it and the White House has promised a veto. 
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will support the funding bill as long as it does not include an explicit ban on spending for Obama's immigration plan, a senior Democratic aide said. 
A small but vocal group of House and Senate conservatives are calling for such a ban as part of a tougher Republican stance against the immigration order, although it raises the threat of a government shutdown. 
Representative Matt Salmon, an Arizona conservative who is a leading proponent of that strategy, said he was disappointed in Boehner's spending plan but resigned to its passage. 
""My assumption is that the fix is in and they don't need us,"" he said, adding that Boehner had backed down from his vow to fight Obama ""tooth and nail"" on the immigration order. 
Several Republican lawmakers said Boehner has sufficient support within his party to pass the funding bill with Democratic help while facing little risk of a rebellion in January when he seeks another term as Speaker. 
Boehner sidestepped questions about what actions Republicans will take next February when DHS funding needs an extension. 

""There are a lot of options on the table,"" he said. ""But I do know this: come January, we'll have the Republican House and Republican Senate, and we'll be in a stronger position to take action.""

171,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2014 02:33PM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers set last-ditch push for Islamic State war authorization,"By Patricia Zengerle 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee made a last-ditch push on Thursday to vote on an authorization for the use of military force against Islamic State before they hand full control of Congress over to Republicans next month. 
As debate intensified in the House of Representatives and Senate over the campaign against the militant Islamist group in Iraq and Syria, Democrats launched a plan to attach a formal authorization for the use of military force as an amendment to a water bill the panel considered - and passed - on Thursday. 
Republicans vehemently objected, accusing Democrats of forcing a politically motivated vote in order to get on the record as objecting to sending any U.S. troops - ""boots on the ground"" - to battle Islamic State. 
During two hours of heated discussion, the committee's Democratic chairman, Senator Robert Menendez, said members had reached an agreement to hold hearings with an eye toward voting on an authorization next week. 
He said Secretary of State John Kerry - or another top official from President Barack Obama's administration - would testify at a hearing on the issue on Monday. 
Senator Bob Corker, the top Republican on the committee, said he was not fully comfortable with what he termed a ""halfway"" process. 
Corker suggested that the committee consider voting on only a 90-day authorization for the campaign of air strikes against Islamic State fighters, which began in August. 
The Tennessee senator is due to take over as Foreign Relations chairman in January, when Congress returns from its year-end holiday recess. 
Many lawmakers, including Republicans and Obama's fellow Democrats, want to vote on guidelines for the fight against the Islamic State fighters, who have killed thousands of people while seizing swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria. 
Republicans have made clear they do not want a vote before the new Congress is seated, although they want the White House to submit a ""robust"" plan. 
House Speaker John Boehner said Obama should submit an authorization in the new Congress. 
""I've got grave concerns that ... the plan he's put in place is not going to accomplish the goal of defeating and destroying ISIL,"" he told a news conference on Thursday, using another acronym for the group.

""We think this is the most practical way to fight the president's action,"" Boehner said. ""And we listened to our members. And, frankly, we listened to some members who were frankly griping the most. This was their idea on how to proceed."" 
Some of the House's most conservative members are calling for a harder stand on spending to fight the immigration order, including an explicit ban on implementation money or a short-term extension on all spending, strategies that would increase the risk of a broad government shutdown like the one in October 2013. 
But several Republican lawmakers said Boehner has sufficient support to pass the funding bill with some Democratic votes while facing little risk of a rebellion in his caucus. 

Part of Boehner's strategy to appease hard-line conservatives is to hold a vote on Thursday on a bill that retroactively rescinds Obama's executive authority over immigration, effectively declaring his action illegal. But the measure will be largely symbolic because Democrats, who still control the Senate, have said they will not take it up, and the White House has threatened to veto it.

174,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2014 09:45AM ET</span>",Republicans seem poised to expand Senate majority with Louisiana race,"By Gabriel Debenedetti 
WASHINGTON/NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Republicans appear poised to expand their Senate majority with a runoff election in Louisiana on Saturday that would cap big wins for their party in the Nov. 4 midterm elections. 
Republican Representative Bill Cassidy is running against Democratic incumbent Mary Landrieu, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee, and has a comfortable lead in polls. 
If he wins, he would be the ninth Republican to capture a previously Democratic seat. His victory would give Republicans 54 seats in the 100-member Senate, enough for a majority but not the 60 seats needed to avoid the tactical blocking procedure known as a filibuster. This means Republicans, who also control the U.S. House of Representatives, would have to work with Democrats to pass most legislation. 
The runoff is being held because no candidate garnered more than 50 percent of the vote on Election Day. A RealClearPolitics average of polls in recent weeks shows Cassidy leading by more than 17 points. 
Last month, Landrieu tried to prove her energy industry credentials by pushing a vote in the Senate to force approval of the planned Keystone XL pipeline from Canada's oil sands to the U.S. Gulf Coast. But the vote failed. 
Landrieu has turned to sharp personal criticisms of Cassidy. 
""I'm running against a guy who is hiding,"" Landrieu told supporters days before Saturday's vote, castigating Cassidy for not participating in more debates. ""And now we know why - because he was double-dipping at the taxypayer expense."" 
In allegations that surfaced on Louisiana political blogs and Landrieu has seized on, Cassidy, a doctor, is accused of falsely filling out some timesheets and failing to file others for a part-time Louisiana State University hospital job after he joined Congress in 2009. 
Cassidy has denied the allegations of wrongdoing and said they are misguided. His campaign has said they are a desperate attempt to discredit him. 
A Louisiana State University spokesman says the school is reviewing the case. 
Cassidy supporters have focused on tying Landrieu to President Barack Obama, who is unpopular in the state. One recent 30-second anti-Landrieu video released by Ending Spending Action Fund featured nine separate images of Obama. 
Americans For Prosperity, a group backed by the libertarian billionaire Koch brothers, on Wednesday released a video connecting Landrieu to Obama's controversial healthcare law and comments made by Obamacare adviser Jonathan Gruber. 
""An Obamacare architect bragged about deceiving Americans to pass the law,"" the narrator says. 

Landrieu's struggle mirrors that of two other southern Democratic senators defeated in the midterms: Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Kay Hagan of North Carolina. Like much of the U.S. South, Louisiana has become much more conservative in the 18 years since Landrieu was first elected to the Senate.

The PTC will be extended for one year retroactively for 2014 if the Senate and President Barack Obama concur. 
""People were expecting a two-year extension, so this is less than expected,"" Nordea analyst Patrik Setterberg said in a note to clients. 
However, he said the Senate had previously argued it wanted a two-year tax package, leading him to conclude the final deal could still change. 
""The outcome in the Senate and the final details of the extension, which are expected at a later stage, will decide whether it is a good or bad deal,"" Setterberg said, adding it was too early to estimate the potential impact on company results. 
Sydbank analyst Jacob Pedersen had previously said shares in Vestas, the world's biggest wind turbine maker, could outperform the market by more than 10 percent within a week or so if the PTC was extended. 

General Electric, Siemens, Gamesa and Suzlon are also active in the U.S. wind power industry, home to almost 20 percent of the world's installed turbines.

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A coalition of 17 U.S. states sued the Obama administration on Wednesday saying it acted illegally by issuing an executive order to ease the threat of deportation for millions of immigrants who are in the country without the proper documents. 
The case being led by Texas and filed at the Federal Court in the Southern District of Texas said the executive order announced by Obama last month violated constitutional limits on presidential powers. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican and the Texas governor-elect, said the lawsuit is not asking for monetary damages but is seeking to have the order declared illegal. 
The White House has said the executive order falls within presidential powers, and has argued that the ultimate answer is for Congress to pass meaningful immigration reform. 
President Barack Obama's plan would let up to 4.7 million of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States stay without threat of deportation, including some 4.4 million who are parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. 
""The President is abdicating his responsibility to faithfully enforce laws that were duly enacted by Congress and attempting to rewrite immigration laws, which he has no authority to do,"" Abbott said. 
 Many of the states in the coalition are Republican strongholds and include Alabama, Idaho, Mississippi and Utah. 
North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican, said his state joined the legal effort because ""the president has exceeded the balance of power provisions clearly laid out in the U.S. Constitution."" 
Abbott said that as a border state Texas has sustained millions of dollars in costs related to illegal immigration. 

Separately, some conservative Republicans in Congress are hoping to thwart Obama's immigration action by tying it to a must-pass government spending bill, although the Republican leadership wants to avert a government shutdown over the issue.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Wednesday laid out a business-friendly legislative agenda for next year that hinges on whether he and the new Republican Congress can set aside long-simmering disputes and find common ground. 
Obama also spoke one-on-one in the Oval Office with Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, whose party routed Democrats in midterm elections last month and who will become Senate majority leader in January. 
Before that session, Obama told the Business Roundtable, a group of chief executives of top U.S. businesses, that he would like to pursue corporate tax reform, free-trade deals and reach agreement on an immigration overhaul to replace his controversial unilateral action last month that loosened immigration policies. 
Infrastructure, patent reform and cyber security were other areas Obama held out as possible areas for compromise. 
All these items are welcome in the business community, but deep differences exist between Obama and Republicans on tax reform and immigration and the president faces opposition from his own Democrats on free trade. 
""The good news, despite the fact that obviously the midterm elections did not turn out exactly as I had hoped, is that there remains enormous areas of potential bipartisan action and progress,"" Obama said. 
While officials gave no details as to Obama's talks with McConnell, the two must overcome deep partisan differences to reach accord. Republicans are still seething at Obama's go-it-alone decision to allow up to 4.7 million illegal immigrants to remain in the country. 
McConnell told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that Obama had veered left since the election. 
""By any objective standard the president got crushed in this election. So I've been perplexed by the reaction since the election, the sort of in your face dramatic move to the left. I don't know what we can expect in terms of reaching bipartisan agreement,"" he said. 
Obama told CEOs he wants to see discussions on tax reform start ""early"" because he said it could take six to nine months to get a deal. 
On immigration, Obama said he thought Republicans would try to ""take a couple of stabs at rolling back"" his executive actions before they grappled with legislation of their own. 

But he made it clear to CEOs that he would not favor legislation that simply dealt with business concerns without addressing the needs of 11 million undocumented people living in the country.

178,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2014 06:33PM ET</span>","Tea Party more subdued, pragmatic as budget deadline looms ","By David Lawder and Susan Cornwell 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tea Party Republicans who led the charge into a 16-day government shutdown last year are now taking a more pragmatic approach as they weigh options on how to fight President Barack Obama's immigration order. 
Pushed by their dissident wing, Republicans blocked government funding in September 2013 in a bid to stop Obama's healthcare reform law, but now numerous Tea Party members appear reluctant to take the battle over immigration that far. 
Instead, even the most strident conservative Republicans are talking about a short-term funding fix that would keep the government running into early next year, when the party takes control of the Senate. 
The government's funding authority expires on Dec. 11, providing possible leverage to opponents of Obama's plan to allow millions of undocumented immigrants to stay and work in the United States. 
But more subdued rhetoric suggests they have little appetite for a repeat of what one conservative Republican described as ""an epic battle"" that pitted ""Washington versus America."" 
""I don't think anybody is thinking about a shutdown,"" said Representative Raul Labrador, an influential Tea Party Republican who voted against the deal to end last year's shutdown. 
Still, Labrador suggested that House Speaker John Boehner tipped his hand by proposing to secure full-year funding for all agencies, with the exception of the Department of Homeland Security, which would only get a short-term extension. 
""In negotiations, you never take anything off the table,"" he said. 
Representative Marlin Stutzman, who also advocated a hard line on Obamacare last year, however, backed Boehner's two-tier approach that secures most government funding through September 2015 but gives Republicans some leverage next year. 
Boehner's plan appeals to many conservatives because it stresses the opportunities that will open up with full Republican control of Congress next year. 
Even those who disagree are still fine with a short-term extension until January, when the Republicans will hold leverage over Obama on immigration, regulation and healthcare and be able to pass spending bills that better reflect their priorities. 
NO APPETITE 
""The cavalry is coming,"" said Jim Jordan, a prominent conservative Republican from Ohio. ""Let's go for a short period of time and wait for our friends to get over in the Senate."" 
Representative Randy Hultgren of Illinois, another conservative who voted against reopening the government last year, said there was ""no appetite"" for a shutdown. 
""We're taking this issue seriously but also realizing that we've got limited options and making sure that we are wise in using those options,"" he said. 
Another reason that Tea Party activists are less fired up for a budget fight is that the public backlash against the 2013 shutdown has made the more mainstream Republicans wary of another such standoff, particularly given the party's ambition to recapture the White House in 2016. 
With a bill to declare Obama's immigration order illegal expected to die in the Senate, Republicans admit that there is little they can do directly to stop Obama's order besides an explicit denial of funding. 
Yet, in contrast to September 2013, Obama's immigration order lacks the visceral impact that the impending launch of Obamacare insurance mandates had at that time. Conservative groups such as the Club for Growth and the Heritage Foundation waged relentless campaigns urging lawmakers to stop Obamacare at all costs. 
Republicans returned to Washington from a 2013 summer recess full of town hall meetings at which voters, fearing soaring insurance costs, implored them to do whatever necessary to stop the launch of Obamacare exchanges and a requirement that all Americans obtain health insurance. 
This time around, the conservative groups are much less vocal. Club for Growth, for example, has said that it does not take a position on immigration issues. 
Furthermore, while most Republicans are angry at Obama's unilateral move to grant what they see as ""amnesty"" for law breakers and a violation of the Constitution, immigration is a more complex issue. 
Whereas it was politically easier to denounce flaws in Obamacare, some Republicans have large immigrant constituencies that would benefit from Obama's order. 

Labrador said that while Boehner and other leaders were listening to conservative critics, he suspected they have already secured enough votes for the plan.

180,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2014 05:06PM ET</span>",U.S. conservatives stand firm against funding for immigration order,"By Richard Cowan and Susan Cornwell 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Conservative Republicans on Wednesday resisted a plan to avert a budget fight over President Barack Obama's immigration order, raising the likelihood that the spending struggle in Congress could last right up to the Dec. 11 deadline for a government shutdown. 
Tea Party lawmakers stood firm against House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner's plan to pass a spending bill keeping most of the government running through September 2015 and postponing the battle over immigration until early next year, when Republicans take control of the Senate and expand their House majority. 
That opposition could force Boehner once again to seek Democratic support to pass his spending proposal and avert a shutdown after the government's spending authority expires. Republican leaders are desperate to avoid that after a 16-day shutdown a year ago inflicted heavy political damage on the party. 
The small but unruly band of conservatives, who have been a persistent headache for Boehner and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, said there was no reason to wait until next year to try to deny funding for Obama's order. 
""Congress should stand up and use the power of the purse,"" said Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. He and others argue that Obama's announcement last month that he was using executive powers to ease the threat of deportation for up to 4.7 million undocumented immigrants amounts to an illegal amnesty. 
""We will not allocate taxpayers money to lawless and illegal amnesties,"" he said outside the Capitol, where a small crowd of Tea Party backers waving U.S. and Revolutionary War-era ""Don't Tread on Me"" flags offered support. 
A ringleader of the House resistance, Representative Steve King of Iowa, estimated a core group of 20 to 50 Republican House members supported the effort to use the must-pass government spending bill as leverage in the immigration fight. 
But Boehner has used Democrats to pass spending bills during previous showdowns, including the shutdown last year, and many conservatives acknowledged they were fighting an uphill battle. 
""There's likely to be Democratic support for it, which means they could pass it without us,"" said conservative Representative John Fleming, a Louisiana Republican. 
A bill to keep the government operating beyond Dec. 11 likely will not emerge in the House until Monday at the earliest, a senior House Republican aide said, meaning floor debate and a vote on passage would not come until Wednesday or Thursday, the deadline day. 
McConnell endorsed Boehner's proposal to pass a full year of funding for most government agencies but give only a short-term extension to the Department of Homeland Security, which will implement the immigration order. 
That would give Republicans a chance to revisit funding for the plan next year when they will take control of both chambers of Congress after November's midterm elections. 
""I think that's a pretty responsible way to go forward. It doesn't shut anything down but also doesn't give the Department of Homeland Security a full year's funding and guarantees a kind of ongoing discussion about this whole issue,"" McConnell said on the Sirius radio program ""Yahoo News on POTUS."" 

McConnell repeated his vow to avoid a shutdown, which he warned would rattle economic markets. The Dow and S&P 500 stock indexes dipped around 5 percent during last year's shutdown, which was accompanied by a dispute over the country's debt ceiling, but rebounded afterward. U.S. economic growth slowed slightly because of spending cuts.

In September, Fitch Ratings downgraded Pennsylvania one notch to AA-minus because of escalating pension liabilities and the nearly 7 percent, or $2 billion, of Corbett's budget that relied on one-time revenue sources. 
The state is also struggling with sluggish revenue and job growth, which has lagged the nation. 
Corbett was voted out in November, the first time an incumbent Pennsylvania governor failed to win reelection since it was allowed in 1968. 
Corbett and the Republican-led legislature ""have run this state into the ground financially,"" said Senate Democratic Appropriations Chair Sen. Vincent Hughes at a news conference after Zogby's presentation. 
Democrats blamed the state's fiscal struggles on one-time budget fixes, poor job growth policies, education spending cuts, and $2.1 billion of corporate tax cuts under Corbett. 
State lottery net revenues have also declined. Pennsylvania is expected to close this fiscal year with only about $1 million in reserves, Zogby said. 
The deficit prompted Democrats on Wednesday to renew talk of implementing a tax on natural gas extraction, a move Corbett resisted for fear it would impede the industry's growth. 
The state could also save money by consolidating some state departments, particularly with a merger of the corrections department and parole board, Zogby said. 
The majority of state worker labor contracts expire in June, and will have to be renegotiated, Zogby said, noting the potential for higher wages.

182,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2014 03:42PM ET</span>",U.S. senator seeks formal declaration of war against Islamic State,"By Patricia Zengerle 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senator Rand Paul called on Congress on Wednesday to formally declare war on Islamic State, as debate intensified in the Senate and House of Representatives over the campaign in Iraq and Syria. 
The Kentucky senator introduced a Senate resolution seeking to declare that a state of war exists with the militant group, the target of four months of air strikes by U.S. and allied forces. 
""Right now, this war is illegal until Congress acts pursuant to the Constitution and authorizes it,"" Paul, a likely 2016 presidential contender, said in a statement. 
Lawmakers will vote in the coming days on a sweeping defense spending bill, the National Defense Authorization Act, which among other things authorizes the arming of moderate Syrian rebels as part of the Islamic State fight. 
Paul's resolution is unlikely to be brought up for a vote any time soon. 
Most lawmakers do not favor a formal declaration of war, saying the campaign is not that extensive. 
But many, including Republicans and Obama's fellow Democrats, want to debate and vote on a formal authorization for the use of force setting guidelines for the fight against the Sunni militants, who have killed thousands of people while seizing swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria. 
Senator Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, said there is a ""strange conspiracy of silence"" about a ""unilateral war"" that has already cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1 billion. He called on Obama to engage with Congress on the issue and urged lawmakers not to head home this month without a vote. 

""We owe it to our troops serving abroad, troops who are engaged in war even as we think about recessing and leaving Washington on Dec. 11 for the holidays, to do our job and to have a debate and vote about the war that our Constitution demands,"" Kaine said in a Senate speech.

The United States has become increasingly critical of Orban's government, accusing him of getting too close to Russia since East-West tensions rose over Ukraine. 
Hungary's foreign minister called in Chargé d'Affaires André Goodfriend over McCain's comments, made in the U.S. Senate during a political spat over the appointment of Hollywood producer Colleen Bell as U.S. Ambassador in Budapest. 
McCain, a Republican, told the Senate on Tuesday: ""I am not against political appointees ... I understand how the game is played, but ... (Hungary) ... is on the verge of ceding its sovereignty to a neo-fascist dictator, getting in bed with Vladimir Putin, and we're going to send the producer of 'The Bold and The Beautiful' as the ambassador."" 
Bell has since been approved in the Senate and is expected to take up her position in Hungary. 
""The Hungarian government ... rejects the words of Senator John McCain regarding the Hungarian Prime Minister and the relationship of Hungary and Russia,"" Foreign Ministry State Secretary Levente Magyar told national news agency MTI. 
Noting Orban's Fidesz party has won parliamentary, European, and local elections, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told MTI: ""Hungarian citizens ... articulated a very clear opinion that everyone ought to respect."" 
He added that the Hungarian embassy in Washington would contact McCain's office to inquire about the Senator's words and their background. 
McCain's office in Washington reaffirmed to Reuters that the senator had been referring to Orban when he used the words ""neo-fascist dictator."" 
The U.S. State Department distanced the U.S. administration from the remarks. ""I think it's no surprise that there are a number of views Senator McCain has espoused that we don't share,"" Spokeswoman Marie Harf told a regular news briefing. 

The United States, as well as European Union partners, has also criticized Orban for what they see as weakening democratic checks and balances and attacking non-governmental organizations.

184,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2014 02:42PM ET</span>",U.S. appoints top diplomat for energy issues,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Wednesday appointed Amos Hochstein as the top diplomat for energy affairs as the Obama administration tests using the power of the domestic energy boom to shape policy with foreign energy producers and consumers. 
Hochstein has been acting as special envoy for international energy at the State Department's energy bureau since Aug. 1. He succeeds Carlos Pascual, a former ambassador to Mexico and Ukraine, who stepped down over the summer. 
As deputy to Pascual, Hochstein worked to help Ukraine, and other European countries, find new supplies of natural gas after Russia invaded it this year. He has also worked on energy issues related to sanctions on Iran and Russia, two of the world's largest oil producers. 
Hochstein has worked closely with officials at the White House's National Security Council and government agencies. 
An open question for the Obama administration is whether it will chip away at the 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports, a restriction that energy companies and some lawmakers say will eventually slow down the U.S. oil boom that has helped keep global oil prices from spiking in recent years. 
In 2011, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton launched the State Department's bureau of energy resources, where Hochstein works, just as Washington was forming tougher sanctions on Iran over its disputed nuclear program. 
Pascual, now a fellow on energy issues at Columbia University, was never confirmed by Congress for the job as assistant secretary for the bureau, amid opposition by some Republican senators. 
Hochstein, who early in his career worked in both the House of Representatives and in the Senate, frequently testifies before congressional panels.

185,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2014 02:07PM ET</span>",North Dakota governor's budget bets on oil price rebound,"By Ernest Scheyder 
(Reuters) - North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple proposed a two-year state budget on Wednesday that forecasts rebounding oil prices and a 23 percent jump in oil taxes, a tacit bet the state's energy boom will continue unabated. 
Oil prices have dropped more than 30 percent since June amidst global oversupply and demand concerns. Last week OPEC opted not to cut its oil production, a step seen by many as designed to squeeze North Dakota and other oil-producing regions of the United States. 
Despite OPEC's decision, Dalrymple expects oil extraction and gross production taxes of $8.32 billion for the 2015 through 2017 biennium, well above the projected $6.76 billion for the two-year term about to end. 
Dalrymple expects daily oil production to rise 15 percent to about 1.4 million barrels by June 2017. 
""This budget plan is ambitious, but we have once again taken great care to make sure we have developed a budget that is balanced and sustainable,"" Dalrymple said in a speech at the state capitol in Bismarck. 
The budget, which must be approved by state legislators, is based on oil prices of $74 to $78 per barrel for the first year and $79 to $82 per barrel for the second. 
The forecasts are well above the current price of oil, around $67 per barrel. Many North Dakota oil executives say their wells are still making money despite the price slide. 
Dalrymple's $5 billion budget allocates $3.7 billion for oil-producing counties to build new roads and other public infrastructure projects. The state's western region is one of the fastest-growing parts of the United States. 
The budget also allocates funding for the state's Public Service Commission to hire eight new rail and pipeline safety inspectors; the state's Department of Mineral Resources to hire 22 oil well engineers and field inspectors; and the state's Department of Health, which oversees water and air quality, to hire 19 new inspectors. 
The state's General Fund, which funds much of the state government, receives only about 4 percent of all oil taxes. 
The state's Legacy Fund, which receives about 31 percent of oil taxes, is expected to reach $6 billion by 2017 from about $3.5 billion today. The fund, designed as a type of ""rainy day"" reserve, cannot be touched until 2017.

186,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2014 01:51PM ET</span>","As CIA, senators settle feuds, long-awaited 'torture' report imminent","By Mark Hosenball 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Senate committee and the CIA have resolved a dispute over redactions in a long-awaited report highly critical of the spy agency's coercive interrogation program, paving the way for the document's likely release early next week, U.S. officials said. 
The document's publication is the culmination of years of work by Democrats who control the Senate Intelligence Committee, but who will cede power when the newly elected Republican majority takes over the Senate next month. 
The harsh CIA interrogations - which human rights campaigners and many U.S. politicians describe as ""torture"" - took place under President George W. Bush; they were banned by President Barack Obama. But release of the Senate report is nonetheless expected to touch off a domestic and international political uproar over CIA activities and U.S. security policies. 
Officials familiar with the committee's investigation say it concludes that there is no proof that harsh CIA interrogations, which included a simulated drowning technique known as ""waterboarding,"" produced U.S. counter-terrorism breakthroughs that could not have been obtained through non-coercive questioning. 
Former intelligence and Bush administration officials who were involved with the interrogation program strongly dispute that conclusion. 
With nudging from the White House, the CIA and key senators in recent days agreed that rank-and-file undercover CIA officers who participated in specific interrogations will mostly be identified in the report by their functions or job titles, the officials said. 
Until recently, investigators working for the committee chair, Senator Dianne Feinstein, had insisted such personnel should be identified by pseudonyms. Intelligence officials argued that publishing pseudonyms could make it possible for foreign spy agencies and CIA critics to figure out the true identities of undercover spies, putting them at risk. 
On this issue, according to officials familiar with the matter, the White House sided with the CIA. 
Officials familiar with the document said it includes case studies in which detainees subjected to coercive questioning are identified by their real name. 
The 20 case studies examining the treatment of individual detainees, the report argues, illustrate how the CIA misrepresented the value of information that harsh interrogation techniques extracted. 
During their inquiry, committee investigators examined millions of pages of CIA operational records and drafted a detailed, but still highly classified, report that runs to 6,300 pages. 
The document that the committee is preparing to publish is a 500-page summary of the larger report. It includes 20 findings by committee investigators about how the interrogation program worked - or did not work - and about 200 pages of history of the program. 

Both the CIA and committee Republicans, who criticized the Democrats' methods and participated in the committee's investigation to a limited extent, are expected to publish rebuttals.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mandatory engine inspections are now required every 13 hours for Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 fighter jets, a significant easing of the three-hour requirement imposed after an engine failure in June temporarily grounded the entire fleet, a top Pentagon official said on Wednesday. 
U.S. Rear Admiral Randy Mahr, the Pentagon's F-35 deputy program manager, said that all of the F-35 jets used for testing were now flying the required ""full envelope"" of speed and other flight maneuvers. 
Separately, a spokesman for the F-35 jet program said certain restrictions remain in place for operational F-35s flown by the Marine Corps, Air Force and Navy, but those are not related to the June 23 engine incident and reflect the fact that the jets are still in developmental testing. 
Mahr told reporters after a defense logistics conference that the F-35 jets were showing improved reliability, and said the program office expected a drop of about 15 percent in its estimate of the overall cost to operate and maintain the U.S. F-35 fleet over the next five decades. 
The Pentagon in April forecast that it would cost $1.02 trillion to operate and maintain the U.S. F-35 fleet over the next 54 years, including inflation, a drop of 9 percent from a previous projection. At the time, the F-35 program office said it felt the cost was closer to $917 billion, given improving reliability. 
Lorraine Martin, Lockheed's F-35 program manager, told reporters at the conference that her company was committed to lowering that so-called sustainment cost by 30 percent over that time period. As part of that drive, Lockheed has looked at every part that is proving less reliable than expected and is redesigning some, and changing processes in other cases. 
Martin said there were now 120 F-35 jets flying at seven military bases, and the F-35 had logged more than 23,000 flying hours. 
Bruce Tanner, Lockheed's chief financial officer, told an investor conference in New York hosted by Credit Suisse that the F-35 program was doing well, and production of the jets was expected to triple over the next four years. 
He also said the Obama administration was widely expected to submit a fiscal 2016 budget request that exceeded the levels set in the Budget Control Act of 2011, but no details had yet been released.

189,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2014 12:24PM ET</span>",'Extenders' tax breaks renewal expected in U.S. House,"By Kevin Drawbaugh 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dozens of special-interest tax breaks would be renewed under a bill expected to win U.S. House of Representatives approval on Wednesday, in a move to let taxpayers claim the tax breaks for 2014 while kicking a broader debate about them into 2015. 
Known as the ""extenders"" package, the temporary tax breaks, affecting a wide range of corporations and ordinary Americans, have been in limbo since they expired at the end of 2013. 
Republicans, who control the House, laid out a plan on Tuesday to renew the extenders retroactively to the beginning of 2014, but only up to the end of this year. 
If the Democratic-controlled Senate approves this approach, which aides said was probable, Congress will have to deal with the extenders again next year, continuing a pattern of annually reconsidering them. 
A short-term extenders renewal would mark a tactical retreat by House Republicans. For months, some of them have been trying to make certain business-related extender provisions permanent, including one for corporate research costs, for instance. 
A tentative bipartisan deal along those lines collapsed last week after the White House issued a veto threat. Some Democrats said they and President Barack Obama viewed the deal as too costly and too slanted in favor of business interests. 
Some analysts said there was still a chance the Senate might seek a broader extenders agreement, but that was a long shot with less than a week remaining before Congress adjourns for the December holidays with other pressing issues on the agenda. 
Next year, Republicans will control both the House and Senate, improving their chances of reshaping the extenders package, viewed by both parties as emblematic of a broken, loophole-riddled U.S. tax code that badly needs reform. 
As the roughly 55-item extenders package stands now, if it were renewed and left in place, it would add an estimated $45 billion to the federal deficit over 10 years. 
The package includes some widely used tax breaks, such as the one for corporate research and one that lets corporations write off costs of new capital and equipment investments. 
The extenders also include tax breaks for school teachers' supply costs, college tuition, mass transit commuters, charitable contributions and alternative energy. 
But the package also has narrow provisions that are often criticized, such as tax breaks for NASCAR race tracks, Puerto Rican rum producers, racehorse owners and Hollywood studios.

190,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2014 01:21AM ET</span>",Bill would cap Russian engines on U.S. satellite launches,"By David Alexander 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A compromise defense policy bill in Congress would bar the purchase of more Russian-made rocket engines to launch U.S. military satellites, clearing the way for competitive bids for 14 future launches, senior congressional aides said on Tuesday. 
The proposal is one of several new agreements included in a compromise version of the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) filed in the House of Representatives and expected to be debated as early as this week. 
The NDAA, which is approved annually, sets U.S. defense policy and authorizes spending levels but does not actually appropriate funds. It has to be approved by both chambers before going to President Barack Obama for his signature. Lawmakers will be asked to approve it without amendments, the aides said. 
The measure authorizes a base defense budget of $521 billion, including $17.9 billion for Department of Energy nuclear weapons work, the aides said on condition of anonymity. 
It also authorizes $63.7 billion in spending on the U.S. war in Afghanistan and the fight against Islamic State rebels in Iraq and Syria. The aides said the funding was at the level sought by the president. 
The bill would bar United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture of Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp, from using Russian RD-180 engines to send U.S. military and intelligence satellites into space unless they were bought before Moscow's invasion of the Crimean peninsula this year. 
Already controversial, the supply deal came under new scrutiny in November, when Reuters reported that a tiny company half-owned by Russian engine maker Energomash stands to receive $93 million in cost mark-ups under an RD-180 contract. Those charges are being added to the program despite a 2011 Pentagon audit that contested a similar, earlier contract with the middleman company, Florida-based RD Amross. 
""Those engines that were already procured under contract at the time of the Crimea invasion are allowed to be used,"" said one aide. ""Anything subsequent to that cannot be used."" 
ULA has an $11 billion contract with the Air Force for 36 launches. The decision to bar purchases of Russian engines after the Crimean invasion meant ULA could seek competitive bids for 14 launches, the aides said. 
ULA uses the RD-180 to power its Atlas 5 rockets, but can also use Delta 4 rockets, which do not require the Russian engines, to launch spy and military satellites. 
ULA spokeswoman Jessica Rye said the RD-180 had been a reliable workforce for the Atlas 5, but the company was working with Blue Origin, a venture run by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, to develop a new domestic engine that would be ready by 2019. 
She said several reports concluded that any effort to ban use of RD-180 engines before a domestic engine was ready would result in billions of dollars of added costs. ""Even if a new entrant is certified, they will only have the technical ability to compete for 60 percent of the missions,"" she said. 

Privately held Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, has sued to be allowed to compete for some launch work. The Air Force is nearing certification of SpaceX to launch satellites using its Falcon 9 rockets. SpaceX declined comment.

191,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2014 01:10AM ET</span>",Iowa firebrand is face of Republican fight on U.S. immigration order,"By Richard Cowan 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Prominently featured on Representative Steve King's congressional website are what he calls ""illegal immigration stories"" that tell of undocumented people, mainly Hispanics, wreaking havoc in America: killing, robbing, kidnapping, trafficking in sex and drugs. 
As the face of the opposition to comprehensive immigration legislation in Congress, King has long used fiery rhetoric to argue for deporting all 12 million undocumented residents and fortifying U.S. borders. 
Now, the Iowa congressman's high-profile role in the debate over President Barack Obama's executive order on immigration threatens Republican leaders' efforts to rebrand the party as more friendly to Hispanics, while his effort to block funding for the action raises the risk of a government shutdown. 
King and Representative Michele Bachmann, a fellow Tea Party activist, plan a news conference on Wednesday to make their case that Obama has violated the U.S. Constitution by moving to shield 4.7 million undocumented residents from deportation if they have no serious criminal record. 
Not stopping there, the 65-year-old, six-term lawmaker told Reuters he would like to push legislation through the House to ""censure"" Obama and top it off with a bill to block funding of the president's immigration initiative. 
Doing anything less, he said, is ""asking members of Congress to fund a lawless, unconstitutional act. It can't be tolerated."" 
Shutting off funds to implement the executive action could kill efforts to pass a government funding bill by a Dec. 11 deadline, forcing the second shutdown of federal agencies in 14 months. 
House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, both eager to avoid budget theatrics following a politically disastrous 16-day government shutdown in October 2013, are working to tamp down such demands from the most conservative Republicans. 
Boehner and McConnell also have an eye on the 2016 presidential elections and the Republican Party's goal, developed after its 2012 White House defeat, to lure Hispanic votes with a more inclusive message on immigration. 
King has other ideas. In January he will host a ""freedom summit"" in Des Moines for some of his party's most conservative ideologues, including Texas Senator Ted Cruz and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, to sketch out their visions for America if they were elected president in 2016. 
""What's remarkable is that he (King) was marginalized, or seemed marginalized, following the 2012 election when Republican leaders and conservatives were lining up to pass immigration reform,"" said Frank Sharry, a leading immigration advocate as head of the group America's Voice. 
Now, this ""hardest of hard-liners,"" Sharry added, ""is arguably the most influential man in the House Republican caucus"" on immigration matters. 
In the past two years, King repeatedly has stomped on Republican efforts to appeal to more Hispanics. He has urged Congress to take advantage of his construction business experience and build a concrete wall along the southern border with Mexico. 
He also talked of illegal immigrant children with ""calves the size of cantaloupes,"" because he said they were hauling marijuana under their pants as they crossed into the United States. That led Boehner to lash out at King, calling his comments offensive and not reflecting the values of the Republican Party. 
In mid-2013, as Boehner vainly tried to lay the groundwork for a major immigration bill, King successfully pushed an amendment in the House to shut down Obama's 2012 initiative easing deportations against undocumented people brought to the United States as children by their parents. 
But while King is a lightning rod for controversy, many of his fellow Republicans are comfortable with at least some of his policy positions, if not his style. 
""To some extent, he and I see things similar in that I am a law-and-order guy,"" said Representative John Carter of Texas, a member of a bipartisan House group that for several years tried to cobble together a comprehensive immigration bill. 
""And Steve is a true believer that we ought to follow the law,"" Carter said. 
Dennis Goldford, a political science professor at Drake University in Des Moines, said Iowans encountered a cultural change by the end of the 1990s as meat packing plants and manufacturers employed large numbers of Hispanics in a state that, according to the Census Bureau, is still 92.5 percent white. 
""Some of that was greeted with open arms, some was greeted with a certain amount of fear and uncertainty,"" Goldford said, adding, ""King has ridden the fear and uncertainty,"" although not with racist intentions. 
Craig Robinson, a former political director for the Republican Party in Iowa, praised King for being a consistent voice on immigration, although the language he uses ""can make it easier for his opponents to make him appear to be one of these cold-hearted conservatives."" 

Sharry countered: ""I can't look into his heart. But I'll say I'm not sure he has one.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of senators on Tuesday renewed a push to overhaul the military's handling of sexual assault cases, and the effort's main sponsor said she might block President Barack Obama's nominee as secretary of Defense over the issue. 
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has been working for much of the past two years for the military to shift authority for prosecuting sexual assault cases to an independent prosecutor instead of top commanders, prompted by a sharp increases in reports of such crimes. 
Gillibrand's bill to change the system fell five votes short of passing earlier this year, although reform legislation that did not go as far moved ahead. 
On Tuesday, noting 12 months had passed since Obama ordered a yearlong review of the Pentagon's handling of sexual assault cases, Gillibrand said too little had changed not to press for more reforms. 
""It's Congress' responsibility to act as if the brave survivors of sexual assault are our sons, our daughters, our husbands and our wives who are being betrayed by the greatest military on earth,"" Gillibrand said. 
At a news conference with five Republican and three other Democratic senators, Gillibrand said she would offer legislation as an amendment to a sweeping defense bill expected to pass this month. 
If it is not considered as an amendment, she pledged to introduce a standalone bill. If that fails, she said she would urge Obama to take executive action to change the system. 
Pentagon leaders have insisted Gillibrand's plan would weaken the chain of command and that officers should have more responsibility, not less, for addressing sex crimes. 
But the plan's backers say the current system failed to stop an epidemic of 26,000 assault cases reported in a 2012 survey, and can leave victims open to retaliation by commanders unhappy that they reported assaults. 
""What we're doing now is not working,"" said Republican Senator Ted Cruz. 
Retired Colonel Don Christensen told the news conference he left his position as the Air Force's chief prosecutor this year because he felt it would be easier to effect change from outside the system. 
""As a military prosecutor, I have personally seen the abuse and injustice victims of sexual assault face,"" he said. 
With Obama expected to pick a new defense secretary shortly, Gillibrand said she might place a ""hold"" on the nomination over the assault issue. 

""I would think about that,"" she said.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2014 07:47PM ET</span>",Republican Boehner tries to avoid spending fight on immigration,"By David Lawder and Susan Cornwell 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner urged fellow Republicans on Tuesday to pass a long-term government spending bill next week, hoping to avoid a government shutdown and pushing any budget fight over President Barack Obama's executive order on immigration into 2015. 
At a closed meeting of House Republicans to plot strategy on how to handle a must-pass government spending bill, Republicans said Boehner argued for funding most of the government through next September but only giving a short-term extension to the Department of Homeland Security, the agency that would implement Obama's executive orders. 
That would allow Republicans to revisit efforts to block Obama's immigration action by placing spending restrictions on DHS activities early next year, while avoiding an immediate standoff that could close federal agencies when current government spending authority expires on Dec. 11. 
But after the meeting, several Republicans said they were skeptical of Boehner's plan and unwilling to remove the shutdown threat from budget negotiations. 
""I don't think anything is off the table. I don't think anybody is thinking about a shutdown, but in negotiations, you never take anything off the table,"" said Representative Raul Labrador, a leading House conservative. 
Many conservatives want to use the spending bill to deny money for Obama's unilateral action lifting the threat of deportation for as many as 4.7 million of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. 
The political stakes are high for Republicans. After broad wins in Nov. 4 elections that will give them a majority in the Senate and a bigger majority in the House next year, Boehner and other Republican leaders want to demonstrate they can govern and avoid a shutdown fight. 
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama would prefer to see the spending bill cover the entire government for a full year but declined to say if Obama would veto a bill with shorter funding for DHS. 
Republicans also said Boehner floated a plan to hold a separate vote on a resolution saying the president does not have the authority to take the executive action on immigration. That vote would be symbolic, however, as it would not likely pass the Democratic-controlled Senate. 
Boehner said after the meeting that no decisions had been made and consultations would continue with Republicans in the House and Senate. 
""I think they understand that it's going to be difficult to take meaningful action as long as we've got Democratic control of the Senate,"" Boehner said. 
""Frankly, we have limited options, limited ability to deal with it directly,"" he said of possible responses to Obama's immigration order. 
Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid told reporters the Senate would ""take a look"" at a House-passed spending bill that included a short-term extension for Homeland Security. 
""That would be a big accomplishment if we could get a bill over here that would fund all the appropriations sub-committees except one,"" he said. 
Representative Peter Roskam of Illinois said Boehner's proposal was well received, and he did not think the conservative effort to delete funding for the immigration order in the must-pass bill would get much traction. 
But Republican Representative Steve King of Iowa, a leading conservative in the fight against the immigration order, said the short-term extension for DHS should cut off any funding for Obama's action even if it leads to a shutdown. 
""It isn't us bringing about a shutdown. We fund everything else, and then the president has to argue that he's going to shut down the government in order for him to carry out his lawless, unconstitutional act,"" King said. 
While some Republicans favor easing immigration laws and hope to bolster Hispanic support for the party, many others are opposed, citing a perceived burden on U.S. society. What unifies Republicans is a belief that Obama's executive orders overstep his legal authority and serve as a form of amnesty for law breakers. 
Republican Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, another prominent conservative, said a short-term extension of DHS that lasted through March was ""not good enough"" because it would allow the administration to begin implementing Obama's action. 
He said Boehner told the meeting the exact length of the DHS extension was still being discussed with the Senate. 
U.S. Homeland Security chief Jeh Johnson told a congressional hearing he would not be able to hire Secret Service agents and detention center personnel the department needs with only a short-term funding bill. 
""I'm urging that we act on our current appropriations request for the sake of border security and homeland security,"" Johnson told the Homeland Security Committee. 

At a tense hearing, Johnson defended the president's plan against Republicans who said it would encourage even more crossings at the southern U.S. border. Congresswoman Candice Miller of Michigan warned the administration would be sued over the action.

194,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2014 07:11PM ET</span>",Congress to push pause on 'extenders' tax breaks fight,"By Kevin Drawbaugh and Emily Stephenson 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Suspending efforts to reshape dozens of special-interest U.S. tax breaks known as the ""extenders,"" congressional Republicans on Tuesday said the measures would be renewed retroactively to Jan. 1 but only through the end of 2014. 
In a move that sets up another round of debate over the extenders in 2015, senior Republicans said a short-term extension would be approved for the package, with the House of Representatives acting as soon as this week. 
Often criticized as emblematic of a loophole-riddled tax code, the extenders affect corporate research, multinational tax avoidance strategies, teachers, commuters, green energy and dozens of other interests. 
The Obama administration weighed in, with Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew meeting with congressional Democrats and saying in a statement that the White House was ""open to supporting shorter-term alternatives"" on the extenders. 
At a cost of tens of billions of dollars to taxpayers, the 55-item extenders package includes some very narrow measures, such as tax breaks for NASCAR race tracks, Puerto Rican rum producers, racehorse owners and Hollywood studios. 
House Republicans had been pushing to make some of the extenders permanent, chiefly tax breaks for corporations. Last week, Democrats brokered a compromise with Republicans, but that deal collapsed after President Barack Obama threatened a veto. 
Last week's plan would have ""given permanent breaks to a relative few, while costing more than $400 billion and leaving out critical provisions that help working families,"" said Democratic Senator Carl Levin, backing Obama's veto threat. 
Next year Republicans will control the House of Representatives and the Senate, improving their chances on reshaping U.S. tax policy. The Republican who will soon become the House's top tax writer said at a conference the extenders would be renewed, but only through the end of the year. 
""We're just going to do a clean, one-year deal,"" said Representative Paul Ryan, who will take over in January as chairman of the House's tax panel, the Ways and Means Committee. 
Since their last authorized extension expired at the end of 2013, the extenders have been in limbo. The Internal Revenue Service has warned that failure to address the situation this year could delay tax return processing in 2015. 
Businesses have clamored for months for more tax-planning certainty, pressuring Congress to act. 

Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters the House would approve a bill this week to renew the extenders.

195,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2014 06:30PM ET</span>",Obama urges Congress to approve $6 billion for Ebola fight,"By Amanda Becker and Roberta Rampton 
BETHESDA, Md./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama urged Congress on Tuesday to approve $6.18 billion to help fight the Ebola outbreak, reminding them that even though the story has faded from the headlines, the battle against the virus is far from over. 
""Every hotspot is an ember that if not contained can become a new fire, so we cannot let down our guard even for a minute,"" Obama said. ""And we can't just fight this epidemic. We have to extinguish it."" 
Obama toured a lab at the National Institutes of Health, where a team of researchers last week published promising results from the first phase of a research trial for an Ebola vaccine. 
Most of Obama's request is aimed at the immediate response to the disease. But the package also includes $1.5 billion in contingency funds - money that could become a target if lawmakers look for cuts, said Sam Worthington, president of InterAction, an alliance of U.S. non-governmental aid groups. 
While lawmakers recognize that the United States had to take action to arrest Ebola, some are wary of giving the administration too much leeway. 
""I think there is less understanding of the need to stay in it for the long run and to build the capacity of countries to ensure this doesn't happen in the future,"" Worthington said in an interview. 
Obama noted that NIH scientists first began work on research that led to the potential Ebola vaccine in 1999, long before the worst outbreak of the disease on record, which has afflicted more than 17,000 people since March, killing more than 6,000. 
He said the United States needs to continue to fund basic research and help nations such as Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone build better public health systems so that the world can quickly contain future disease outbreaks. 
""It is a smart investment for us to make. It's not just insurance. It is knowing that down the road we're going to continue to have problems like this, particularly in a globalized world where you move from one side of the world to the other in a day,"" Obama said. 
The Obama administration came under fire in September after a series of missteps with a man who traveled to Dallas from Liberia and later died of Ebola. Two nurses contracted the disease while caring for the man. 

Screening and treatment procedures have since been tightened. There are now 35 U.S. hospitals equipped to deal with Ebola patients, up from three before the outbreak.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who will lead the chamber starting in January, told reporters: ""If the court would rule the way they might, we could be in a very large comprehensive revisitation"" of U.S. healthcare policy. 
The nation's highest court is expected to rule by the end of June on a conservative challenge to an important part of President Barack Obama's 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. 
The Supreme Court last month agreed to hear arguments for and against tax-credit subsidies to help millions of Americans get health coverage under the law. 
McConnell said it was difficult to outline what comprehensive legislation would look like, given that the Supreme Court ruling is likely months away. 

But he ticked off a list of Obamacare provisions that Republicans have long railed against, including a medical device tax, the requirement that individuals purchase health insurance and a 30-hour work-week to define full-time employment under the law.

In a statement on Tuesday, the Ohio lawmaker said he could not be an effective senator and campaign for the White House at the same time, and sees potential in the new Republican majority in Congress to tackle issues such as revamping the tax code, overhauling the nation's energy sector and boosting exports. 
His decision comes as Republicans prepare to take over the Senate in January after November elections that gave the party control of both houses of Congress. 
""With the new Republican majority, I see a real opportunity over the next two years to break the gridlock in Washington and actually get things done to help Ohioans and all Americans,"" Portman said. 
Portman gained some Democratic allies when he became one of the most prominent Republican politicians to support gay marriage rights in 2013, two years after his son told him he was gay. 
He is also known for his focus on fiscal matters. He served as head of the Office of Management and Budget and was the U.S. trade representative under Republican President George W. Bush. 
While in Congress, he was a member of the so-called ""super committee"" that failed to reach a grand bargain on the nation's spending. With no deal, ""sequester"" automatic spending cuts across the board began in early 2013. 
Despite that failure, Portman said he sees potential to work through political differences in Congress and said lawmakers ""must pass a responsible budget to address the record levels of debt."" 
Other potential Republican presidential candidates in 2016 include Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Chicago City Council voted on Tuesday to gradually increase the minimum wage in the nation's third largest city to $13 an hour by 2019, approving a proposal by Mayor Rahm Emanuel. 
Emanuel's measure to boost the minimum wage from the current $8.25 an hour follows similar actions by Seattle, San Francisco and other cities. 
""We want to make sure people can afford to live here,"" Emanuel said after the vote on the increase, which was opposed by business groups. 
The mayor sought approval for his minimum wage proposal now to get ahead of state lawmakers, who could vote to raise the hourly minimum to $10, according to Crain's Chicago Business. A state law could prevent cities from passing higher wage increases. 
Emanuel's support of the increase could help him counter challengers in his re-election bid, who claim that he favors business interests over working people. The mayoral election is in February. 
The ordinance will affect more than 400,000 workers in the city and add some $800 million to the Chicago economy, according to a mayoral panel appointed to study the issue. 
Grassroots Illinois Action applauded the increase but said it would continue to fight for a $15 minimum wage, which had been proposed by some of Chicago's Aldermen. 
""Chicagoans know that an increase to $13 over five years is not enough,"" the group said in a statement. 
The Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce and its Illinois counterpart have opposed the increase, saying the state already has a higher minimum wage than that of neighboring states but has lagged in the economic recovery. 
""Raising the minimum wage has not proven to reduce poverty or narrow the income gap and puts a stranglehold on Illinois' top job creators: small businesses,"" the Illinois Chamber of Commerce said in a statement after the vote. 
Chicago's minimum wage will rise to $10 by mid-year 2015, to $11 by 2017, and $13 by 2019. 
Alderman Bob Fioretti, who will challenge Emanuel in the mayoral race, said he would continue to fight for $15 an hour, which would match the level approved in Seattle in June. 
""The chant in the streets here and nationwide has been 'show me $15,' not 'show me $13 by 2019,'"" Fioretti said in a statement, although he did vote for Emanuel's proposal, which had been recommended by the council's workforce development committee. 

Several states have approved increases in minimum wages this year, including Michigan and Minnesota.

MIAMI (Reuters) - A suspended Miami-area mayor and prominent Haitian activist was duped by her business partner into recruiting straw buyers to lend their names to fraudulent mortgage applications that netted at least $8 million in loans, her attorneys told a jury on Tuesday. 
Marie Lucie Tondreau, who became the first female Haitian-American mayor of North Miami when she was elected in 2013, is standing trial in federal court in Miami after being indicted in May on six counts of wire fraud. 
She faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted of a scheme prosecutors say was carried out from 2005 to 2008, before she took office. She is suspended from her post while the case is pending. 
Prosecutors said Tondreau paid relatives and listeners of her radio show up to $5,000 each to take part in the scheme that ended with her renting out at least 20 properties and using the proceeds for clothes and other purchases. 
""When Ms. Tondreau took to the airwaves to promote this mortgage company she brought a sense of credibility,"" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Lois Foster-Steers. 
But Tondreau's attorneys said her advocacy for Haitian immigrants and notoriety as a critic of former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier made her the ideal target for a mortgage company owner looking to secure financing with fabricated information. 
""Lucie was helping people come up in life, she wasn't helping in fraud,"" defense attorney Michael Davis said during his opening statement. 
The leader of the scheme, Karl Oreste, pleaded guilty to seven wire fraud charges in July and is due to be sentenced in early 2015. He is expected to testify against Tondreau. 
She is one of nearly a half dozen Miami-area mayors charged with an array of crimes over the past two years.

201,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2014 01:59PM ET</span>",Obama expected to nominate Ashton Carter to lead Pentagon: sources,"By Phil Stewart and Steve Holland 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Pentagon official Ashton Carter emerged on Tuesday as the expected nominee to replace Chuck Hagel as U.S. defense secretary, sources familiar with the situation said. 
Carter, a former deputy secretary at the Department of Defense, would have the task of breaking into the tight-knit White House inner circle that President Barack Obama has leaned on to run national security policy. 
His influence would be tested as the United States wrestles with a growing list of international crises - from the battle against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria to troubled ties with Russia and a still-resilient Taliban enemy in Afghanistan. 
A variety of sources inside and outside the administration said Carter was the front-runner and was expected to be the nominee. One person familiar with the situation said his nomination was ""almost certain."" 
An announcement was expected in the coming days, an administration source said. The White House and the Pentagon had no comment. 
Hagel resigned under pressure last week after less than two years at the helm of the Defense Department. Whoever replaces him will be Obama's fourth defense secretary. 
Hagel had privately expressed frustration with his inability to influence major questions of U.S. security strategy, including the fight against Islamic State. His relationship with Obama's inner circle at the White House was strained. 
Carter, 60, served for four years in senior Pentagon jobs and was the No. 2 official at the Pentagon from October 2011 to December 2013, when he stepped down. Previously, he was the Pentagon's chief arms buyer, giving him deep knowledge of defense procurement and weapons policy and control over billions of dollars in spending. 
He also served as assistant secretary of defense for international security policy under President Bill Clinton. 
The top job may fall to him by default. Another top candidate, former Pentagon official Michele Flournoy, abruptly withdrew from consideration last week, as did Democratic Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island. 
Administration sources said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson had been a candidate but was no longer in the mix. Former Navy Secretary Richard Danzig and Kurt Campbell, a former assistant secretary of state, had also been seen as contenders. 

Carter has bachelor's degrees in physics and medieval history from Yale, a doctorate in theoretical physics from Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes scholar, according to the Pentagon website.

Johnson spoke at a hearing before the House Committee on Homeland Security that marked the first public airing of Republican resistance toward U.S. President Barack Obama's executive action, which is expected to allow 4.7 million undocumented immigrants to stay and work in the United States temporarily. 
Johnson told the committee he personally recommended each action Obama took to shield the immigrants. 
""The reality is that, given our limited resources, these people are not priorities for removal,"" Johnson said. 
Representative Michael McCaul, the Republican chair of the committee, said the president's directive would be perceived as amnesty to those considering crossing the U.S. southern border. 

""If we don't think that message is making its way back to Mexico and Central America, we are simply fooling ourselves,"" said McCaul. ""We will see a wave of illegal immigration because of the president's actions."" 
McCaul said Obama did not have the legal authority to make the order.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Tuesday will press Congress to approve $6.18 billion in emergency funding to help fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and prepare U.S. hospitals to handle future cases. 
Most of the request is aimed at the immediate response to the disease at home and abroad. But the package also includes $1.5 billion in contingency funds - money that could become a target if lawmakers decide to trim the bill. 
""That is the part of the package that is most at risk,"" said Sam Worthington, president of InterAction, an alliance of U.S. non-governmental aid groups. 
While lawmakers recognize that the United States had to take action to arrest the deadly disease, some are wary of giving the administration leeway in investing money in public health systems in West Africa. 
""I think there is less understanding of the need to stay in it for the long run and to build the capacity of countries to ensure this doesn't happen in the future,"" Worthington said in an interview. 
The worst Ebola outbreak on record has killed at least 5,987 people since March, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. 
The Obama administration came under fire in September after a series of missteps with a man who traveled to Dallas from Liberia and later died of Ebola. Two nurses contracted the disease while caring for the man. 
Screening and treatment procedures have since been tightened. There are no current U.S. cases, and stories about the outbreak have faded from headlines.

""Republicans need to show they're not just against things, that they're for a bunch of things,"" said Bush, 61, a former two-term governor of Florida who is considering entering the Republican presidential nomination race for 2016. 
""We have to show that we can, in an adult-like way, lead,"" he said at a Wall Street Journal conference, pointing to issues such as the Keystone XL oil pipeline and a possible lifting of the ban on crude oil exports. 
Bush spoke as some Republicans are weighing shutting down the government in an attempt to stop Obama from taking executive action on immigration policy. Obama last month decided to unilaterally ease the threat of deportation for some 4.7 million undocumented immigrants. 
Bush said Obama overstepped the bounds of his authority but that Republicans should focus less on what the president does and more on building consensus in Congress for their own proposals. 
He urged an immigration system that accepts newcomers based on the United States' economic needs, rather than on the familial ties of those already in the United States - similar to the approach used in Canada. 
""It's also probably the easiest way to get to sustained economic growth, which is what we desperately need,"" he said of his immigration approach.

U.S. Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters on Monday that the final version of the massive bill will not allow the president to transfer inmates to the United States. 
""Our language (on Guantanamo) ... will not be in,"" Levin said. 
The defense bill, which has been passed annually for more than half a century, is likely to be approved by the House of Representatives and Senate in the coming days and then sent to the White House for Obama to sign into law. 
Obama has promised to shut the detainee camp since he entered the White House in early 2009, citing its damage to the U.S. reputation around the world. He has so far been unable to do so, partly because of resistance from Congress. 
In its version of the National Defense Authorization Act written earlier this year, the majority-Democratic Senate panel included language that would have allowed some transfers to the United States. 
Such transfers are strongly opposed by some Democrats and many Republicans, who hold a majority of seats in the House, and were left out of the compromise version of the bill. 

Advocates for closing the camp say it violates U.S. principles such as not holding prisoners without charge. They say it also acts as a recruiting tool for anti-American militants, and is very expensive to keep open.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executive of shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries on Monday said he was optimistic U.S. lawmakers would eventually ease budget caps on U.S. military spending that are dampening investment in longer-term weapons research. 
""Cooler heads have a way of prevailing on something like this,"" Mike Petters told Reuters in an interview at the company's offices near Washington's Navy Yard. 
Petters said Huntington Ingalls was initially insulated from the brunt of automatic spending cuts known as ""sequestration,"" given its long-term contracts with the Pentagon, but work on new programs, including a submarine to carry nuclear weapons and a small amphibious ship, would require investment decisions in coming months and years. 
Uncertainty about budget levels and the Pentagon's longer-term priorities made it hard for big firms like his and hundreds of smaller suppliers to invest in technologies and processes that could drive costs down in the longer-term, he said. 
""It sort of feels like we're saving money, because we're keeping the numbers down, but in fact we're making the things that we want to buy ... more expensive,"" he said. 
Unlike commercial firms, arms makers work mainly for a single customer, the U.S. government, which means they need clear guidance before investing in new machinery, designs and workers, Petters said. 
The Defense Department is facing cuts of nearly $1 trillion in projected spending over a decade under the Budget Control Act of 2011. A congressional deal last year eased the effects of some of the cuts, but they are due to return in fiscal 2016. 
Petters welcomed a new initiative aimed at developing new weapons to keep ahead of Russia, China and other potential foes, but said companies needed clear signals about which investments would be worthwhile, and how and when they would generate sales. 
He said the Navy's decision to base a new class of smaller amphibious ships on the LPD-17 class built by Huntington Ingalls was a positive step, because it would allow the company to focus its investments on making those ships more affordable, he said. 
He said he hoped lawmakers would fund procurement of a 12th LPD-17 class ship to bridge to the new class of warships since a break in production would drive costs higher.

Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Republican Representative Stephen Fincher of Tennessee, had said via a Facebook post that Obama's daughters, Malia, 16, and Sasha, 13, needed to show ""a little class,"" complaining they appeared to look uninterested last week during an appearance with their father at a White House pre-Thanksgiving ceremony at which he had ""pardoned"" a turkey. 
Her post unleashed a backlash on social media, prompting Lauten to later apologize on Facebook for her comments. 
""I was taken aback that there was a political operative on Capitol Hill who did use the occasion of the Thanksgiving-themed event to criticize members of the presidential family,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday. 
Earnest said that Lauten's subsequent apology was ""an appropriate thing for her to do."" 
Children of presidents have generally been off limits for criticism in Washington. 
""Act like being in the White House matters to you,"" Lauten said in the Facebook post last week. 
She also took a shot at the president and his wife, saying the Obama girls did not have good role models. 
On Monday, Lauten told NBC News that her resignation from Fincher's staff was ""in the works."" 

No one in Fincher's office was available to confirm Lauten's plans.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and his teenaged daughters, Sasha and Malia, went to an independent book store in Washington to buy books as a way to promote Small Business Saturday, an event aimed at boosting small businesses. 
""Do I get a discount for that?"" the president asked jokingly while unloading a bunch of books from his shopping basket at the Politics and Prose book store on Saturday. 
""Maybe a neighbor's discount,"" the clerk joked back. 
It is not clear whether Obama would have taken the discount, if offered. 
The first family shopped at the same bookstore last year. 
On Saturday, Obama was met by a mostly cheery crowd of shoppers and got a round of applause when a baby earned a presidential selfie. 
Over the clicking of cameras and flashes of smart-phones, one shopper yelled: ""When are you going to close Guantanamo?"" 
""We're working on it,"" the president replied. ""Any other issues?"" 
Started in 2010 by credit card company American Express, Small Business Saturday comes on the Saturday after Thanksgiving Day, to encourage people to spend their holiday shopping dollars at small businesses. 
It is the Black Friday for mom-and-pop shops that has become an annual tradition and has gained momentum, spawning ""shop local"" movements in communities across the country. 
Last year, shoppers spent about $5.7 billion at small companies on Small Business Saturday, according to a joint survey by National Federation of Independent Business and American Express. 

The White House did not immediately provide a list of the books purchased by the first family.

215,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2014 05:39AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Obama plan to 'Power Africa' gets off to a dim start,"By Joe Brock 
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Barack Obama last year told a cheering crowd in Cape Town that a $7 billion plan to ""Power Africa"" would double electricity output on the world's poorest continent and bring ""light where currently there is darkness"". 
A year later, the U.S. president's flagship project for Africa has already achieved 25 percent of its goal to deliver 10,000 megawatts of electricity and bring light to 20 million households and businesses, according to its annual report. 
But the five-year plan has not yet delivered the power. 
Power Africa has not measured its progress by counting actual megawatts added to the grid but promises of additional power made in deals it says it helped negotiate, according to sources inside the project and documents seen by Reuters. 
Some projects facilitated by Power Africa -- a program operated by the U.S. aid agency USAID -- were under way years before the scheme's inception, others are still in the planning stage. 
It is unclear how much of the $7 billion Obama pledged has actually been spent or if a further $20 billion in private sector investment commitments will materialize. 
""Saying you've met targets on projects that might never happen or taking the credit for projects that have been worked on for years makes me uncomfortable,"" a source working on Power Africa told Reuters. ""It's misleading."" 
Obama's pledge to double power generation in Africa within five years looked highly ambitious from the start. Per capita electricity output in Sub-Saharan Africa has been flat for three decades because most promised power plants never get built. 
""We're dealing with megawatts on paper, rather than on the grid,"" a second source working on the project said. 
""Is that really what Obama promised?"" 
The first African-American U.S. president, the son of a Kenyan father, Obama has often been criticized for a lukewarm engagement in Africa, consisting more of words than deeds. 
""WE'RE LIKE A PHARMACIST"" 
The 48 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, with a combined population of 800 million, produce roughly the same amount of power as Spain, a country of just 46 million. This constrains Africa's growth and keeps hundreds of millions in poverty. 
Power Africa coordinator Andrew Herscowitz told Reuters there had been some confusion about the role of the program. He said it was always intended to ""expedite transactions"", facilitating private investment rather than handing out aid. 
Herscowitz said Power Africa was there to help the private sector deliver electricity and it had already negotiated commitments from companies worth $20 billion, although he did not know how much of this money had been spent. 
""We're like a pharmacist, where people come to us, we reach out to people and figure out what is needed,"" he said. 
""In some projects we may have a lot of involvement and in some we have very little involvement."" 
Foreign companies sign billions of dollars of agreements with African governments to build infrastructure every year, although a large number never get built. 
In April 2011, the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corp., a government aid agency involved in Power Africa, signed a $350 million deal to ""revitalize"" Malawi's power sector. 
More than three years on, 1.7 percent of that money has been spent, according to the programmer's website, which gives no detail on progress on the ground. 
Memoranda of understanding Power Africa signed this year with its six focus countries -- Tanzania, Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, Liberia and Ghana -- contain less than $100 million of financial commitments targeted at specific countries, most of which is for consultants. 
U.S. consultancy Tetra Tech won a $64 million contract and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's Africa Governance Initiative was given a $3 million deal. 
As with many African aid projects, rights groups have criticized Power Africa as mostly being a vehicle to subsidize U.S. companies. 
Documents show $5 billion out of the $7 billion pledged is for loans for U.S. exports from the government's Export-Import Bank (EXIM) and Overseas Private Investment Corp. (OPIC). 
TURN ON THE LIGHTS 
""It's absolutely not true. Power Africa is an opportunity to turn on the lights for millions of Africans by taking investment from all over the world,"" Herscowitz said. 
Herscowitz rejected suggestions Power Africa merely tapped into existing projects, highlighting a 5 megawatt ""NextGen"" solar project in Tanzania and a 30 megawatt biomass scheme in Kenya which he said ""didn't exist before Power Africa"". 
The NextGen project website, however, says a power purchase agreement for the solar project was signed in January 2013, six months before Power Africa was launched. 
It is by no means guaranteed that the Power Africa program, which has an initial five-year mandate, will continue or be seen as a priority when Obama's final term ends in two years, U.S. government sources told Reuters. 
In addition, the investment banks EXIM and OPIC are fighting for their survival in Congress, where Obama's Democratic Party was severely weakened in mid-term elections this month. 
In a change of tack, the U.S. government said this month it wants to partner with China on improving power in Africa. 
Meanwhile, corruption in the countries that Power Africa operates in remains a problem. 

Nigeria's state oil company was accused last year by the then central bank governor of withholding $20 billion in oil funds due to the government, while Tanzania's parliament is currently reviewing a report on graft in its energy sector.

The memo from the non-partisan Congressional Research Service to Republican Senator Jeff Sessions could provide a boost to him and other conservatives who are pushing for a December budget confrontation with Obama to try to stop his executive order overhauling the U.S. immigration system. 
A plan to deny such funds in a must-pass federal spending bill next month, as part of a Republican effort to fight Obama's immigration move, could heighten the risk of another government shutdown. 
House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, a more moderate Republican, has argued against such a strategy, pushing instead for a spending bill that fully funds government agencies through September 2015. He has said that simply ""defunding"" immigration agencies would have little effect because the primary agency that would process the applications could still operate on the fees it collects. 
But the Congressional Research Service said lawmakers could halt operations of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency by including language explicitly prohibiting the use of funds by a specific agency for a specific purpose. 
""If a statute were enacted which prohibited appropriated funds from being used for some specified purposes, then the relevant funds would be unavailable to be obligated or expended for those purposes,"" the research service said in the memo. 

It went on to say that such legislative language would also apply to funds collected through fees but noted that courts could have different interpretations.

217,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2014 05:10PM ET</span>","Tensions flare between Senate Democrats, White House","By Roberta Rampton 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Criticism of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law by a top Senate Democrat this week laid bare post-election tensions that could pose challenges for the party in upcoming fights with Republicans over taxes, energy and immigration. 
In a high-profile speech on Tuesday dissecting Democrats' losses in this month's midterm elections, Charles Schumer, the No. 3 Senate Democrat, listed ""a cascade of issues"" botched by the White House, starting with Obama's push for healthcare reforms soon after he took office in 2009. 
Later on Tuesday, the White House took the unusual step of publicly pledging to veto a deal on tax breaks that Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid was trying to hammer out with Republicans in the House of Representatives. 
""There is clearly a lot of unhappiness and a lot of mistrust that exists between the president and his congressional party,"" said Ross Baker, political scientist at Rutgers University. 
Democrats will cede control of the Senate to Republicans in the New Year after heavy losses in the Nov. 4 elections that also gave the Republicans an increased majority in the House. 
Obama, whose low approval ratings were seen as a drag on his party in the elections, may see support waver from some Democrats on an energy issue - the proposed Keystone XL pipeline to carry oil from Canada's oil sands to be processed on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Democrats in states where voters want pipeline will face a dilemma over whether to break ranks with Obama and back Republican legislation aimed at forcing the project through. 
Republicans will also try to thwart the executive action on immigration that Obama announced last week and that grants temporary relief from deportation for millions of immigrants who are living in the United States without the right papers. 
Several Democratic senators have been critical of Obama for taking executive action rather than letting Congress take the lead on the issue. If six or seven joined Republicans, they could block Obama's action, forcing a veto. 
'POST-DISASTER SYNDROME' 
In some ways, Schumer's remarks were typical of the kind of ""post-disaster syndrome"" of finger-pointing common after election losses, Baker said. 
""Typically, when a political party has suffered an electoral debacle, one of the first things they do is shoot the survivors,"" he said. 
According to Schumer, the party lost because the White House messed up on ""a cascade of issues,"" starting with the healthcare reform push in 2009, at a time when Americans were more preoccupied with the recession. 
Also on Schumer's list of White House errors: the rollout of insurance marketplaces, fixing wait lists for veterans' hospitals, dealing with the first case of Ebola in the United States, and even security at the White House itself. 
His remarks illustrated how some Democrats are trying to start to move apart and away from Obama. 
""At this point now, Obama is not running for president again,"" said Matthew Green, associate professor of politics at the Catholic University of America. ""But Democrats in the Senate are, and they want to get back the majority at some point. They are going to be thinking about, what can we say and do to help ourselves in next election cycle?"" Green said. 
Former Obama aides dismissed Schumer's comments as playing politics. 
""Funny, I don't remember Chuck Schumer giving that advice when he was privately and publicly championing the Affordable Care Act in 2010,"" said Jon Favreau, a former White House speechwriter, on Twitter. 
""So what exactly does Chuck Schumer believe was the error? Does he believe that the goal of winning office is winning office?"" said Jon Lovett, another former Obama aide. 

Top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi also rebuked Schumer, saying in a statement, ""We come here to do a job, not keep a job.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday pardoned a turkey named Cheese to mark the country's Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, when roasted turkey is the traditional main course.
Obama, in a light-hearted ceremony before a small group of White House visitors, said that pardoning Cheese would surely be the ""most talked-about executive action"" he has taken this month.
""Today I am taking an action fully within my legal authority, an executive action taken by Democrat and Republican presidents before me, to spare the lives of two turkeys, Mac and Cheese,"" Obama said.
Obama's remarks, which referenced his announcement last week that he would take action to defer deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants, drew laughter from the crowd.
Though Cheese alone is the National Thanksgiving Turkey, he will be joined by Mac at Morven Park's Turkey Hill, the former home of a Virginia governor. There, the two birds will enjoy a form of amnesty, Obama said.
U.S. presidents have been pardoning turkeys since the 1800s. Starting in 2012, the top turkey has been chosen by a public vote.
The White House said that Mac and Cheese were ""beak-to-beak"" on Twitter in the days leading up to the pardon as users weighed in on which bird should receive the official pardon.
Mac and Cheese are males born in July that hail from Cooper Farms in Oakwood, Ohio.
Mac is a ""feather shaker"" who weighs in a 47 pounds and boasts a melodious gobble that has a hint of bluegrass, #TeamMac supporters within the White House said.
Cheese is a ""grand champion"" who weights in at 49 pounds and has a gobble that manages to be both romantic and has a country ring, #TeamCheese White House aides said.
The chairman of the National Turkey Federation, Gary Cooper of Ft. Recovery, Ohio, was at the pardoning ceremony, along with seven family members. Cooper's son raised Mac and Cheese without antibiotics.
Mac and Cheese will now leave their room at the posh Willard InterContinental Hotel near the White House, where they awaited their fate, and travel to the farm in Leesburg, Virginia, where they will receive visitors.

Two additional turkeys were presented to the First Family by Jaindl's Turkey Farm in Pennsylvania. Those birds will be donated to a Washington-area food bank for the holiday.

The former Massachusetts governor would have a slight edge over potential Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by 45 percent to 44 percent in a general election, the poll found. 
Among possible Republican candidates, Romney's 19 percent put him ahead of former Florida governor Jeb Bush with 11 percent, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Ben Carson each with 8 percent each, and U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky with 6 percent. 
Carson, a former neurosurgeon with no political experience, is a conservative commentator and author of ""One Nation,"" which topped the New York Times best-seller list in June. 
U.S. Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee all had 5 percent, while 16 percent of those questioned were undecided.

As part of a deal settling a legal challenge to the law, the state agreed police will not be allowed to detain or stop a person merely to check immigration status or to transport him or her to federal officials based on officers' suspicions, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said in a statement. 
""Utah's decision to settle this case sends a clear message to states and cities across the country that they have no business stopping or detaining people just because of suspicions about their immigration status,"" said Jennifer Chang Newell of the ACLU, which was a party to the agreement 
The ACLU argued in a 2011 lawsuit that the law illegally interfered with federal authority over immigration matters and authorized unreasonable seizures and arrests. 
The agreement, which was outlined in a federal court filing on Tuesday and requires judicial approval, follows a June ruling by U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups that the state cannot detain someone based just on an officer's suspicions or a racial profile. 
It can verify the legal status of arrested persons, he ruled. 
Waddoups also tossed out a part of the law making it a crime to harbor an illegal immigrant and a provision requiring local police to investigate immigration offenses. 
His ruling came more than a year after the case was argued in Salt Lake City's federal court. 
Modeled after a similar law in Arizona, the measure was part of a package of immigration reform bills that were due to take effect in May 2011. 
""We don't have a statement beyond the filings at this point, but may after Judge Waddoups reviews the submission,"" Missy Larsen, spokeswoman for Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, said in an e-mail. 
U.S. President Barack Obama announced last week he was easing the threat of deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants. 
Tuesday's agreement allows immigration status checks only during a lawful detention or after a detainee has been released, according to court documents. 
It also says a stop or arrest cannot be prolonged merely to confirm a person's immigration status. 
The settlement further says the law does not require Utah residents to carry identification at all times, the ACLU said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - President Barack Obama was interrupted several times by hecklers during a speech on his immigration policy on Tuesday, and their complaint was that his plan did not go far enough in protecting illegal immigrants from deportation. 
At least four hecklers, all of them women, yelled at the president at the Copernicus Center where he had gone to promote his go-it-alone immigration plan that will remove the threat of deportation for up to 4.7 million illegal immigrants. 
Obama had gone to a Polish neighborhood to stress that the immigration problem in the United States is not restricted to Latinos and that there are people from around the world who are in the country illegally, such as Poles and Irish. 
Obama was in mid-speech when a woman shouted about his deportation policies. Under the Obama administration, thousands of people in the country illegally have been deported, an issue frequently raised with the president by pro-immigrant advocates. 
""OK, it's good to be back in Chicago,"" Obama said in reply to the hecklers. The president is from Chicago. 
""But I'm not going to be able to have a conversation with each of you separately. There are other ways of engaging. Just sit down.... I know people are passionate about this. But be respectful of people who are here.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in Congress on Tuesday vowed to reject an emerging Republican effort to split immigration-related funding from a full-year government spending bill that avoids a government shutdown. 
The plan, being pushed by some conservative Republicans including incoming House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, would provide a short-term funding extension only for immigration agencies as a way to exert leverage against President Barack Obama's immigration order last week. Everything else would get normal full-year funding via an ""omnibus"" spending bill, Republican aides said. 
Congress needs to approve new spending authority for federal agencies and discretionary programs by Dec. 11 to avoid another government shutdown. 
The plan aims to satisfy conflicting Republican priorities of providing stable government funding and a desire to try to stop the Obama administration from granting permission to some 4.7 million undocumented immigrants to stay and work in the United States. 
A short-term extension for immigration-related agencies would allow Republicans to deny funds to these agencies next year when they control both the Senate and House of Representatives. The primary agency for processing immigrant residency applications, however, is funded through fee collections. 
Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, said that Republican leaders have made no decisions on how to proceed with a spending bill. Congress will take these decisions up when it returns to Washington on Dec. 8. 
Staff for the House and Senate Appropriations committees are continuing negotiations on the full-year omnibus spending bill for all agencies, aiming for a House vote the week of Dec. 8, House Appropriations Committee spokeswoman Jennifer Hing said. 
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said House Democrats would not support any bill that provides long-term funding to some agencies and short-term ""continuing resolution,"" or CR, for others. The concoction has taken on the ""CRomnibus"" moniker. 
""House Republicans are seeking to disguise their efforts, threatening our national security in order to undermine the president's clear legal authority,"" Pelosi said in a statement issued on Tuesday. ""We will not be enablers to a Republican government shutdown, partial or otherwise.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. Senate Democrat said on Tuesday that President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats made a major political blunder in 2009 when they chose to focus on healthcare reform instead of concentrating on fixing the economy. 
Charles Schumer, the No. 3 Senate Democrat, said it ""made no political sense"" for the party to push healthcare reform as its highest domestic priority when lack of health insurance coverage affected only a small portion of voters. 
Schumer, a New York Democrat, said the decision sent a message to middle class Americans that ""the Democrats are not paying enough attention"" to their concerns. When Obama took office in early 2009, the financial system was in crisis and the economy was mired in recession. 
""The plight of uninsured Americans and the hardships caused by unfair insurance company practices certainly needed to be addressed. But it wasn't the change we were hired to make,"" Schumer said, noting that 85 percent of Americans receive healthcare coverage from their employer or the government. 
Obama's signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act, is aimed at reducing the number of uninsured people. 
""We would have been better able to address it if Democrats had first proposed and passed bold programs aimed at a broader swath of the middle class,"" Schumer said in remarks at the National Press Club. 
In reaction to Schumer's comments, former White House aide Tommy Vietor derided the New York senator, saying his remarks were the equivalent of saying, ""I wish Obama cared more about helping Democrats than sick people."" 
Schumer's comments were the latest example of divisions within the Democratic party that have emerged since the Nov. 4 midterm elections in which Republicans wrested control of the Senate from Democrats and increased their numbers in the House of Representatives. 
Dissatisfaction with Obama, whose approval ratings are stuck near 42 percent, helped to fuel the Republican gains. 
In an interview with the Washington Post the day after the midterms, David Krone, a top aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, discussed frustrations he had with the Obama White House over its approach to fundraising for the midterms. 

Some congressional Democrats have also differed with Obama over his decision to ease the threat of deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants. Tuesday's speech was the first of three addresses Schumer plans to give about the future of the Democratic Party, with a theme of embracing a pro-government platform.

The United States ""is in close contact with the government of Israel on extending the longstanding memorandum of understanding"" between the two countries on emergency oil supplies, a State Department official said on the condition of anonymity. 
The agreement was first signed in 1979 by Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan after the Iranian revolution sent shock waves of higher prices and fears about disruptions in the Middle East through oil markets. 
Under the agreement, the United States, provided it has enough oil for its own use, will provide Israel crude for purchase. If Israel is unable to secure transportation for the oil, Washington will make ""every effort"" to help Israel secure transit, according to the agreement. 
The pact is an exception to Washington's ban on crude oil exports that Congress passed after the Arab oil embargo of 1973 to 1974 spiked petroleum prices and led to fears of shortages. Israel has never asked the U.S. to supply it with emergency oil. 
Amid a six-year drilling boom that has led to a glut of light sweet crude along the U.S. Gulf Coat refinery hub, the Obama administration has been pressured by oil companies to relax or lift trade restrictions. 
The agreement between the United States and Israel was extended in 1994 and in 2004.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama issued an appeal on Monday for restraint by protesters and police after a Missouri grand jury decided not to indict a white police officer in the shooting death of a black teen last August. 
In a late-night appearance in the White House briefing room, Obama also urged Americans to understand that much work remained to be done to improve relations between black Americans and law enforcement. 
""We need to accept that this decision was the grand jury's to make. There are Americans who agree with it and there are Americans who are deeply disappointed, even angry. It's an understandable reaction,"" Obama said. 
Angry crowds in Ferguson, Missouri, took to the streets on Monday night and there were flashes of violence after the grand jury determined there was no probable cause to charge officer Darren Wilson in the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. 
The shooting set off weeks of sometimes violent protests in the St. Louis suburb and highlighted racial tensions in the community. 
Obama said there were still many parts of the country where a deep distrust existed between law enforcement and communities of color, and that steps must be taken to improve the situation, such as increasing the number of minority people who enter the police ranks. 
""Some of this is the result of racial discrimination in this country and this is tragic because nobody needs good policing more than poor communities with higher crime rates. The good news is we know there are things we can do to help,"" he said. 
About 200 protesters demonstrated peacefully outside the White House on Monday night, holding signs and chanting: ""We are Michael Brown."" 
Obama has weighed in on questions of race previously. When black Florida teenager Trayvon Martin was killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in 2012, Obama said: ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon."" 
In 2009, he criticized the police handling of the arrest of Harvard University professor Henry Gates, saying police acted ""stupidly.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several U.S. Republican lawmakers insisted on Monday that the extension of nuclear talks with Iran be accompanied by increased sanctions, setting the stage for a battle with the Obama administration after their party takes full control of Congress next year. 
Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte, three of the party's leading foreign policy voices, said they view Iran's insistence on having any enrichment capability at all as problematic and warned that a ""bad deal"" would lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. 
""We believe this latest extension of talks should be coupled with increased sanctions and a requirement that any final deal between Iran and the United States be sent to Congress for approval,"" they said in a statement. 
Iran and six powers failed on Monday for a second time this year to resolve the 12-year dispute over Tehran's nuclear ambitions, and gave themselves seven more months to resolve the deadlock that has prevented an historic deal. 
John Boehner, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, said an extension only allows the administration to make more concessions to Iran. 
Some Republicans held off calling for immediate new sanctions, but insisted Congress must be allowed to weigh in on any final nuclear agreement with Iran. 
Senator Bob Corker, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Congress must be given say on a deal and should begin preparing alternatives, including tougher sanctions, in case negotiations fail. 
""I would rather the administration continue to negotiate than agree to a bad deal that would only create more instability in the region and around the world,"" Corker said in a statement. 
President Barack Obama's fellow Democrats, who blocked a largely Republican attempt to tighten sanctions a year ago, backed the extension, saying Congress should not do anything that might imperil the talks. 
""A collapse of the talks is counter to U.S. interests and would further destabilize an already volatile region,"" said Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee. 
Obama has insisted that more sanctions imposed by Washington would antagonize Iran, anger other countries now supporting international sanctions and collapse the negotiations. 
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Monday further sanctions on Iran could be counterproductive.

231,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2014 04:38PM ET</span>","Hagel, under pressure, resigns as U.S. defense secretary","By Phil Stewart and Steve Holland 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel resigned on Monday, leaving under pressure as President Barack Obama faces critical national security challenges, including fighting Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and revising plans to exit Afghanistan. 
It was the first major change to Obama's Cabinet since his Democrats were routed in midterm elections three weeks ago, and Republicans, who now control both houses of Congress, are looking for a new approach from the White house. 
Hagel was appointed less than two years ago as Obama pushed his signature program of winding down wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, a process now being upended with U.S. re-engagement in Iraq and greater military cooperation with Kabul. 
He had privately expressed frustration to colleagues at the administration's strategy toward Iraq and Syria and at his lack of influence over the decision-making process, a source familiar with the situation said. 
Officials said publicly the decision for him to leave was mutual but privately others said he was forced out. ""There's no question he was fired,"" said one source with knowledge of the matter. 
Hagel raised questions about Obama's strategy toward Syria in an internal policy memo that leaked this fall saying the president's policy was in jeopardy due to its failure to clarify its intentions toward Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 
Obama has insisted the United States can go after Islamic State militants without addressing Assad, who the United States would like to leave power. 
REPUBLICANS DEMAND CHANGE OF APPROACH 
House Republican Speaker John Boehner said the change at the Pentagon ""must be part of a larger re-thinking of our strategy to confront the threats we face abroad, especially the threat posed by the rise of ISIL (Islamic State)."" 
Senator John McCain, who is expected to become chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee which will vet the new nominee, called for changes in Obama's defense policies. 
McCain, a fierce critic of the president, told Reuters Hagel had been ""very unhappy"" about micro-management from the White House and did not believe that Washington had a strategy to combat Islamic State. 
Hagel will remain as Defense Secretary until his replacement is confirmed by the Senate. Congressional sources said it was almost certain that would not happen until after January, when Republicans take over and will control the confirmation process. 
A Vietnam War veteran and longtime Republican senator, Hagel, 68, had been criticized by some for failing to clearly articulate policy, including during his confirmation hearing nearly two years ago. 
He submitted his resignation letter after lengthy discussions with Obama that began in October, officials said. 
Obama praised Hagel at a White House event called to announce his departure, saying he had always been candid with his advice and had ""always given it to me straight"". 
Officials said Obama wanted fresh leadership during the final two years of his administration. 
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that when Hagel was appointed, the focus for the defense department was sorting out its budget and Islamic State was not an issue. Fighting the group would be the top priority for his successor, he said. 
FLOURNOY IS POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR 
Top potential candidates to replace Hagel include Michele Flournoy, a former under secretary of defense, and Ashton Carter, a former deputy secretary of defense, who were rumored to be contenders for Hagel's job before he was named. 
Hagel, who was the only enlisted combat veteran to serve as defense secretary, ran into a wave of opposition when Obama, a Democrat, nominated him. 
Republicans objected partly because Hagel opposed the 2007 'surge' of troops in the Iraq war, which eventually helped defeat al Qaeda and other militants and opened the way for a U.S. troop withdrawal. 
He was seen as poorly prepared and hesitant during his confirmation hearing, including refusing to answer 'yes' or 'no' when McCain demanded he judge whether he was wrong to oppose the surge strategy. 
Hagel, who became an outspoken critic of the administration of President George W. Bush, had also upset many in his party by endorsing Obama in his presidential race against Republican Senator John McCain in 2008. 
Defense analyst Loren Thompson said Obama had seen Hagel as someone who could build bridges to the Republican Party, particularly in disputes over the massive defense budget, but Hagel's ties were not in fact strong to begin with. 

""What they need is a focused person who can clearly communicate with Capitol Hill on the need to loosen budget caps"" that were damaging the military's ability to function, Thompson said. ""Hagel seemed like he would appeal to both sides, but he wound up alienating Republicans and angering Democrats.""

In an interview on Saturday, Paul said his proposal would limit the duration of military action to one year and significantly restrict the use of ground forces, the Times said. 
His proposal differs from others circulating in Washington in that he wants to formally declare war against Islamic State, which Congress has not done since World War Two, the newspaper said. 
Some members of the U.S. Congress have said U.S. President Barack Obama is waging war against the Islamist militant group without proper congressional oversight. 
The administration has said Obama has the legal authority to conduct the current fight against Islamic State. The campaign involves air strikes in Iraq and Syria, training and equipping so-called moderate rebels in Syria, and hundreds of U.S. military advisers helping Iraqi and Kurdish troops against the militants. 
Paul said Congress had ceded too much authority to Obama because it had not developed its own policy, the Times said. 
""War cannot be initiated without Congress,"" Paul told the Times. 

""Conservatives are mad at him about immigration. And they're mad about him using executive authority on Obamacare,"" he said. ""But this is another example where he doesn't have much respect for Congress, and some conservatives don't quite get that.""

""She's not going to agree with me on everything,"" Obama told ABC's ""This Week With George Stephanopoulos."" ""One of the benefits of running for president is you can stake out your own positions, and have a clean slate, a fresh start."" 
After Obama announced his go-it-alone immigration overhaul on Thursday, Clinton issued a statement supporting Obama's plan but urging Congress to ""finish the job"" by passing comprehensive immigration legislation. 
Obama, whose 40 percent job approval rating was a drag on Democrats in Nov. 4 midterms elections, said he doubted he will be asked to campaign much for the eventual Democratic nominee in 2016. He acknowledged having some ""dings"" like an old car.""I think the American people, you know, they're gonna want, you know, that new car smell. They want to drive something off the lot that doesn't have as much mileage as me,"" he said.

Several hundred U.S. troops were deployed in Poland and the three Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia earlier this year after Russia seized Ukraine's Crimea region in March. The deployment was part of Washington's efforts to reassure the nervous eastern European allies that NATO would offer protection from any Russian threat.

236,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2014 12:29PM ET</span>",Obama to Republican critics on immigration: 'Pass a bill',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama shrugged off criticism of his executive action on immigration with a challenge to House of Representatives Republicans: if you don't like it, do something. 
Obama was asked in an interview broadcast on Sunday about House Speaker John Boehner's assertion that he was acting like an emperor in using executive powers to tackle the issue of the 11 million immigrants living in America without documents. 
""Well, my response is pass a bill,"" Obama said in the interview with ABC's ""This Week"" taped on Friday. ""Congress has a responsibility to deal with these issues and there are some things that I can't do on my own."" 
Obama announced on Thursday he was easing the threat of deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants. His measures include allowing some 4.4 million people who are parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents and who have been in the country for five years to remain in the country temporarily, with the right to work. 
Obama, who has long said he preferred legislation to unilateral action, cited a bipartisan immigration bill passed by the U.S. Senate last year and urged the House to take it up. 
Boehner has not given any indication he will act on immigration this year, and Republicans have been divided on how to respond to the executive order. 
Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said on ""Fox News Sunday"" his party should use spending bills to withhold funds to implement the order. That could force Obama to veto vital funding bills, sparking a government shutdown similar to the one last year. 
Cruz, who led that shutdown fight in an effort to block funds for the Obamacare health plan, said the big Republican gains in the midterm elections showed the shutdown was not a political blunder. Republicans will control the Senate and have a bigger House majority in the new Congress that begins in January. 
""It was not a mistake for Republicans to stand up and fight Obamacare,"" he said. ""Republicans need to actually do what we say we'll do."" 
Democratic Senator Bob Menendez said Obama's actions did not make the need for immigration reform any less pressing and said the House should pass the Senate bill. 

""They still have time to pass that bill,"" he told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program. ""There's still clearly a persistent, urgent need to do that.""

WASHINGTON/KABUL (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has approved plans to give U.S. military commanders a wider role to fight the Taliban alongside Afghan forces after the current mission ends next month, a senior administration official said. 
The decision made in recent weeks extends previous plans by authorizing U.S. troops to carry out combat operations against the Taliban to protect Americans and support Afghanistan's security forces as part of the new ISAF Resolute Support mission next year. 
Obama had announced in May that U.S. troop levels would be cut to 9,800 by the end of the year, by half again in 2015 and to a normal embassy presence with a security assistance office in Kabul by the end of 2016. 
Under that plan, only a small contingent of 1,800 U.S. troops was limited to counter terrorism operations against remnants of al Qaeda. The new orders will also allow operations against the Taliban. 
""To the extent that Taliban members directly threaten the United States and coalition forces in Afghanistan or provide direct support to al Qaeda, we will take appropriate measures to keep Americans safe,"" the official said. 
A report by the New York Times late on Friday said the new authorization also allows the deployment of American jets, bombers and drones. 
The announcement was welcomed by Afghan police and army commanders after heavy losses against the Taliban this summer. 
""This is the decision that we needed to hear ... We could lose battles against the Taliban without direct support from American forces,"" said Khalil Andarabi, police chief for Wardak province, about an hour's drive from the capital and partly controlled by the Taliban. 
Afghan government forces remain in control of all 34 provincial capitals but are suffering a high rate of casualties, recently described as unsustainable by a U.S. commander in Afghanistan. 
More than 4,600 Afghan force members have been killed since the start of the year, 6.5 percent more than a year ago. Despite being funded with more than $4 billion in aid this year, police and soldiers frequently complain they lack the resources to fight the Taliban on their own. 
""Right now we don't have heavy weapons, artillery and air support. If Americans launch their own operations and help us, too, then we will be able to tackle Taliban,"" said senior police detective Asadullah Insafi in eastern Ghazni province. 
The Taliban said it is undeterred by the U.S. announcement. 
""They will continue their killings, night raids and dishonor to the people of Afghanistan in 2015. It will only make us continue our jihad,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujajhid said.

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - President Barack Obama defended his decision to bypass Congress and overhaul U.S. immigration policy on his own on Friday, saying he was forced to act because House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner would not let legislation come to a vote. 
With many Americans skeptical of his decision to bypass Congress and impose an immigration overhaul unilaterally, Obama attempted to rally support for his move in a speech at a Las Vegas high school, saying illegal immigrants need a chance to come out of the shadows. 
He engaged in a cross-country debate with Boehner, the top U.S. Republican, who accused Obama in Washington of sabotaging chances for bipartisan legislation and vowed to lead a fight to block his executive actions. 
In the summer of 2013, the Democratic-run Senate passed compromise immigration legislation but the bill died in the Republican-controlled House. Obama said he waited to see if the House would ever pass the legislation, but Boehner would not let it come to a vote. 
""I told John Boehner, 'I'll wash your car, walk your dog, whatever you need to do, just call the bill,"" Obama said. ""And he didn't do it."" 
To those lawmakers who feel he overstepped his constitutional authority, Obama said his message to them is: ""Pass the bill."" 
Obama's move threatens to herald a new round of partisan gridlock in Washington as Republicans who will control both chambers of Congress in January react with scorn to his decision. 
Republicans remain split on the best course of resistance to Obama's action easing the threat of deportation for some 4.7 million undocumented immigrants. Conservative groups were already pulling together legal strategies to challenge it. 
""With this action, the president has chosen to deliberately sabotage any chance of enacting bipartisan reforms that he claims to seek. And as I told the president yesterday, he's damaging the presidency itself,"" Boehner told reporters. 
""We're working with our members and looking at the options available to us,"" he said. ""But I will say to you, the House will, in fact, act."" 
Obama received a rousing welcome from a largely Latino audience at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas, the same place he visited just after beginning his second term in 2013, when he laid out his principles for immigration reform. 
""Si se puede,"" they chanted. 
A heckler shouted at Obama that his order did not go far enough. Obama engaged him from across the high school gym. 
""I've heard you, young man, I've heard you. But what I'm saying is that this is just a first step,"" Obama told him. 
Outside, a couple of dozen protesters who opposed his actions shouted slogans and held up signs that said: ""Stop Obama Amnesty."" 
Before getting off Air Force One shortly after landing in Las Vegas, Obama signed two presidential memoranda to set in motion part of the biggest U.S. immigration changes in a decade. 
Just hours after his speech on Thursday night, Republicans launched a long-threatened lawsuit against the administration on another topic, accusing it of abusing executive authority through implementation of the president's ""Obamacare"" health reform law. 
Republicans have said in recent weeks they would consider adding a challenge to the Obama immigration order to the healthcare lawsuit. 
But the most prominent strategy under consideration, supported by many conservatives in Congress, is to withhold funds for implementation of the immigration order from a major spending bill needed to fund the government by Dec. 11. 
A fight over the spending bill could lead to another shutdown of federal agencies, one year after a 16-day closure that inflicted heavy political damage on Republicans. 
""We do need to find a way to really push back,"" Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who has called for using the spending bill as a vehicle to challenge the order, said at the Heritage Foundation. 

Other Republicans have suggested a range of options, from opposing all of Obama's nominees unless he relents, to stand-alone legislation undoing the order and even impeachment.

240,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2014 12:43AM ET</span>",Obama signs order expanding U.S. Afghanistan role: NYT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama has signed a secret order authorizing a broader military mission in Afghanistan in 2015 than originally planned, the New York Times reported on Saturday. 
The decision ensures a direct role for American troops in fighting in Afghanistan for at least another year, it said, adding Obama's decision was made during a White House meeting with national security advisers in recent weeks. 
In May, Obama said the American military would have no combat role in Afghanistan next year. Missions for the remaining 9,800 troops would be limited to training Afghan forces and to hunting the ""remnants of al Qaeda"", he said. 
Obama's new order lets American forces execute missions against the Taliban and other militant groups threatening U.S. troops or the Afghan government. 
The new authorization also allows U.S. air strikes to support Afghan forces on combat missions and U.S. troops occasionally to accompany Afghan troops on operations against the Taliban. 
The Times did not mention if the change would affect the number of American troops deployed to Afghanistan. 
The change emerged from debate over two imperatives: Obama's promise to end the war in Afghanistan, and the Pentagon demand to let American troops fulfill their remaining missions there, the Times reported. 
Some civilian aides have argued against risking American lives next year in operations against the Taliban, saying there should only be a narrow mission against al Qaeda, it said. 
But generals urged Obama to define the mission more broadly if intelligence showed extremists threatening American forces. 
Two issues shifted the debate, the Times said. 
Obama's Afghanistan strategy faces stiffer criticism after the advance of Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria, it said, while Afghanistan's new president has been more accepting of a broader American military mission than his predecessor. 
Asked about the report, a senior administration official said the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan would be over by year-end, as Obama had announced in May. 
""Safety of our personnel is the president's first priority and our armed forces will continue to engage in operations in self-defense and in support of Afghan security forces,"" the official said. 

""While we will no longer target belligerents solely because they are members of the Taliban, to the extent that Taliban members directly threaten the United States and coalition forces in Afghanistan or provide direct support to al Qaeda, we will take appropriate measures to keep Americans safe.""

New Jersey officials have hoped that legalized sports wagering would generate more revenue for Atlantic City's gambling industry, which has lost customers to a spate of new casinos opening in nearby states. 
In a 31-page opinion, U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp wrote that the law, signed last month by Republican Governor Chris Christie, violated a federal statute that bans sports betting in nearly all U.S. states. 
""This (law) necessarily results in sports wagering with the state's imprimatur, which goes against the very goal of (the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act),"" Shipp wrote. 
""The court has determined that the 2014 Law is invalid."" 
Voters approved the idea of legal sports betting in 2011, and the following year, Christie signed a bill doing just that. But the NBA, NFL and other sports leagues successfully sued, saying the measure violated the federal ban. 
Last month, Christie attempted to revive the state's push for sports betting by signing a law that partially repealed New Jersey's ban on wagering in the state. That law would allow sports betting at state-licensed casinos and racetracks. 
The sports leagues took the state back to court on Oct. 20, saying the new effort also violated the federal sports gambling ban and they would suffer irreparable harm if it took effect. 
Judge Shipp issued a temporary restraining order days later, blocking the bill, before granting a permanent injunction in Friday's opinion. 
New Jersey Senate president Stephen Sweeney said in a statement on Twitter after the ruling that he would continue, ""pursuing every legal option available."" 
""The economic impact sports wagering can have on (New Jersey) is far too important,"" he added.

Senior Republicans issued a subpoena this month to force the export lender, which conservative lawmakers would like to close down, to provide complete transcripts of meetings of its board of directors and audit committee. 
Darrell Issa, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said the edited transcripts previously provided by the bank made it difficult to assess Ex-Im's decisions and whether it should be allowed to remain open. 
In a letter dated Nov. 19, a copy of which was made available to Reuters on Friday, Ex-Im Chairman Fred Hochberg said he was enclosing transcripts which included details of the board's deliberations, but not confidential client information. 
""The production includes limited redactions of business confidential information in a way that does not impede an understanding of the issues and transactions discussed at the meetings,"" Hochberg wrote. 
Republicans also asked for certain employees to attend transcribed interviews. Hochberg said the bank would make staff available for briefings with committee staff or to provide testimony at congressional hearings. 
Critics say Ex-Im, which provides loans to foreign buyers of U.S. goods such as Boeing Co planes and support to U.S. exporters, unfairly picks winners and losers and objects to the U.S. government's role in lending. 
The bank's charter was renewed in September for nine months through June 2015, when it must be renewed again or face closure. Issa's office had no immediate response to Hochberg's letter.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Standing outside a drugstore in the bitter Chicago wind, Jonathan Todd shared tips with a fellow volunteer on how to collect signatures to get their candidate on the mayoral ballot. 
""Hold your pen tight in your hand - that keeps the ink from freezing,"" said Todd, working for mayoral hopeful Amara Enyia. 
Todd was one of an army of campaign workers around the city this week scrambling for signatures before a Monday deadline to get a ballot spot to challenge incumbent Rahm Emanuel in February's election. 
The third-largest U.S. city has the toughest ballot requirements in the country, said Richard Winger, an expert on ballot access legal issues. Contenders for mayor must file 12,500 voter signatures with the elections board, compared with 3,750 in New York and no more than 2,000 in Los Angeles. 
""I'm not aware of any cities large or small that require more than 5,000 signatures,"" said Winger, who noted that most cities depend on filing fees instead. He called the Chicago process ""very unfair,"" especially when it is cold. 
Serious Chicago candidates typically gather two or three times the required number to survive expected challenges to the signatures' validity. 
Emanuel has already filed 43,000 signatures. His best-known opponents, Cook County Commissioner Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia and Alderman Bob Fioretti, say they will have more signatures than they need by Monday's deadline. 
""If the mayor decides to challenge our petitions, we have a plan in place,"" said Fioretti spokesman Michael Kolenc. 
The election is non-partisan, and the winner must get 50 percent of the vote plus one to avoid a runoff. 
Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis, who had been favored over Emanuel in polls, decided in October not to run due to a serious illness. 
Lewis endorsed Garcia. A survey commissioned by the CTU this month found that in a three-way race, Garcia and Fioretti could force a runoff - voters favored Emanuel by 33 percent, Garcia by 18 percent and Fioretti by 13 percent. 
Chicago political experts say that while petition challenges are typical, it is not clear at this point who will challenge whom. 
Emanuel survived a residency challenge before his 2011 election. That fight won Emanuel positive press, so he may decide to skip challenges altogether, said Dick Simpson, political science professor at University of Illinois-Chicago. 
""He risks looking like a bully,"" Simpson said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama will attend India's Republic Day celebrations in January as chief guest, a sign of steadily expanding ties between two countries that share concerns about China's growing power in Asia. 
Obama was invited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and will be the first U.S. president to attend a Republic Day celebration, the White House said on Friday. Diplomats said Obama, who visited India in 2010, would also be the first U.S. president to visit the country twice while in office. 
India's relations with Washington have flourished in the past decade, although they have also had tussles over trade and other issues. The two countries are developing a strategic partnership prompted by shared concerns about China's increasingly assertive territorial claims in the Asia-Pacific region. 
Modi met Obama on a visit to the United States in September and they have spoken by telephone since. Their relationship is thought to have helped resolve a major trade spat in the World Trade Organization. 
Modi used a Twitter message to announce Obama as the chief guest on Republic Day, which marks the enactment of India's constitution on Jan. 26, 1950. 
Dhruva Jaishankar, a South Asia specialist at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said the invitation to Obama was a sign of ""a radically altering political calculus"" in New Delhi, where previous leaders traditionally sought to keep some distance from Washington. 
""This visit will also mark a real turnaround over eight or nine months ago, when questions were still being asked about Modi's willingness to cooperate with the United States, given his history of having been denied a visa,"" Jaishankar said. 
Modi was denied entry into the United States from 2005 until he was elected prime minister in May, after allegations he did too little to stop religious riots that killed at least 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, in his home state of Gujarat. Modi denied any wrongdoing. 
India traditionally invites a head of state to participate as chief guest for Republic Day celebrations, which culminates in a military parade including its nuclear capable missiles. 
Much of the hardware dates back to the Soviet era, when India had close ties with Moscow, while more recent defense purchases include billions of dollars of U.S.-made equipment.u 

Last year's chief guest was Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has taken a tough line with China over its territorial claims.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Moving to curb predatory sales practices targeting U.S. military personnel, the Pentagon said on Friday it was reforming its payment system for troops to prevent them from using direct salary deductions to buy consumer goods like cars and computers. 
Under the reforms that go into effect Jan. 1, 2015, military personnel will no longer be able to have the Pentagon directly deduct money from their salaries to make installment payments for personal property like cars, washers and dryers or big-screen televisions, a defense official said. 
The reforms would not affect purchases that have already been made and are ongoing, but troops would not be able to initiate new transactions for consumer-style goods, the official said. The system could still be used for mortgages, rent, savings, investments and transferring money to relatives. 
""Low-lifes that occasionally hang around outside a military base looking for ways to get money out of service members were finding allotments attractive because it put them at or near the head of the line to get paid if they sold a service member something,"" another defense official explained, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Troops could still set up similar electronic funds payments for consumer goods with their banks, a step that would give them greater legal protections than they now have under the military's so-called allotment system, officials said. 
The military system is widely used by uniformed personnel. An analysis by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service found that 1,951,659 allotments were in effect in 2012 and used to make nearly $3.8 billion in payments. 
Warrant officers had an average of nearly 6 allotments per person, while commissioned officers and enlisted personnel had almost 4 per person, the analysis found. 
Of the top 10 allotment processors, three particular institutions were considered abusers of the system, processing 999,588 allotments worth nearly $1.4 billion in 2012, a defense official said. 
In one case, for example, military personnel were sold cars that required them to pay via the allotment system. The firms involved failed to disclose add-on fees, a proper schedule of payment and other loan details that inflated the final cost of the vehicle. 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year ordered the companies involved, which included Minnesota-based U.S. Bank and Kentucky-based Dealers' Financial Services, to reimburse $6.5 million to the troops who used the service.

246,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2014 01:05PM ET</span>",Senate Democrats blast New York Fed over bank regulation,"By Howard Schneider 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley came under fire on Friday from Democratic senators who blasted the bank for lax oversight of major financial institutions. 
""Is there a cultural problem at the New York Fed? I think the evidence suggests that there is,"" said Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren, a frequent critic of the big banks who is seen as a possible 2016 presidential candidate. 
""Change has to come from the top,"" she added. ""Either you need to fix it Mr. Dudley or we have to get someone who will."" 
The heated questioning at a Senate hearing suggested potential support for a proposal to make the New York Fed chief's job a presidential appointee - one of a number of ideas for reforming the Fed that may be debated in the coming months. 
The New York Fed is the most powerful of the U.S. central bank's 12 regional branches. It acts as the Fed's eyes and ears on Wall Street and regulates many of the largest banks. In addition, its president has a permanent vote on monetary policy, while other Fed bank chiefs rotate in and out of voting spots. 
No Republicans attended the hearing before the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection, but Democrats on the panel pushed Dudley hard on what they argued were lapses in oversight of several large institutions, including JPMorgan and Dudley's former employer, Goldman Sachs. 
""Troubling reports suggest that it is back to business as usual at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,"" Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown said as he kicked off the hearing. 
Dudley, a former Goldman Sachs partner, said he agreed ""regulatory capture"" - the idea that a regulator could become too close to a bank, clouding their judgment - was a constant concern, but he argued the Fed had improved its oversight markedly since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. 
He said, however, that he was open to stricter rules against Fed regulators taking jobs in the banking industry, particularly with institutions they supervised. Current ""revolving door"" laws prevent such job shifts only in some cases and only for a year. 
""A legitimate question is whether you should make the standards tighter,"" perhaps by applying it to more supervisors and for a longer period of time, Dudley said. 
But he otherwise staunchly defended the New York Fed in a calm but insistent manner through nearly 1-1/2 hours of testimony. 
The questioning delved into cases raised in recordings made secretly by former New York Fed examiner Carmen Segarra and aired in recent news reports. Dudley argued that all of those cases were properly vetted. 
The portions of the tapes aired in public, which portray Segarra as squelched in her criticism of Goldman Sachs, were not necessarily reflective of how she was treated at the New York Fed, he said. 
Dudley said the central bank had ""made significant changes to the substance and process of supervision,"" including establishment of a centralized committee to oversee the supervision of the 15 largest U.S. financial institutions, which account for more than $50 billion in assets. 
The Fed's Board of Governors on Thursday announced a review of its oversight of large banks, an apparent attempt to preempt some of the congressional criticism. The study will include a specific look on whether contrary views are encouraged.

247,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2014 12:40PM ET</span>","Conservatives, states set to launch legal blitz against Obama over immigration","By Mica Rosenberg 
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The morning after President Barack Obama announced his sweeping action to overhaul the U.S. immigration system, conservative groups and states were already pulling together legal strategies to dismantle the plan. 
Opponents said there will likely be a three-pronged legal approach to stymie Obama's moves: Congress could sue the president for constitutional overreach, states could file lawsuits arguing the action strains local finances, or individuals could try to prove they've been harmed by the order. Just hours after the speech, an Arizona sheriff filed suit arguing the reform is unconstitutional. 
""There is going to be massive litigation all over the place because there is tremendous legal confusion about what the administration is doing and what the states' obligations will be,"" said Dan Stein from the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), which calls for restrictions on immigration. 
While law scholars say the president is on strong legal footing, a flurry of lawsuits will cause headaches for the Obama administration in its final two years and may stir public opinion against a policy meant to be one of his signature triumphs. 
Obama's health care plan, another major political victory for the President, has also been mired in legal challenges with opponents taking suits all the way to the Supreme Court. Just on Friday, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives filed a long-anticipated lawsuit challenging Obamacare. 
States are already lining up to sue over Obama's immigration action, under which he plans to grant temporary legal status to some 4.4 million undocumented immigrants who are parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. 
Republican governors Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Rick Perry of Texas and Pat McCrory of North Carolina have all voiced support for taking legal action without giving further details. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt also announced his intention to sue. 
MODEL LAWSUIT 
Still, making a legal case will be an uphill battle. Presidents historically have had wide discretion to act 
alone on immigration and under a concept known as ""prosecutorial discretion,"" can decide to not enforce every violation of federal law when resources are limited. 
In a 33-page legal memo, the Department of Justice said the action falls within the bounds of the constitution and that Congress has supported favorable treatment of law-abiding immigrants with deep U.S. ties. 
The main hurdle for any lawsuit will be proving ""standing,"" a requirement under U.S. law that for someone to be able to sue, they have to show they have been directly harmed.   
The hardest case to win would be one filed by Congress, legal experts say, since lawmakers would struggle to prove standing. Republicans have vowed to act in other ways and could try to pass laws to take away the President's authority to act on immigration or slash funds for his initiatives. 
States might have a stronger argument if they can prove financial harm from the program. 
One ongoing case challenging Obama's previous executive action in 2012 to grant deportation relief to immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children, could serve as a model. 
The suit was filed by a group of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers upset by White House directives. The state of Mississippi attempted to join the action. 
To prove standing, Mississippi argued illegal immigrants 
drained state resources and the ICE agents said they were being forced to violate their oaths to enforce the law. 
Even though a federal judge dismissed the case, he found the ICE agents had standing. Mississippi was dropped from the case but only because its economic analysis showing harm was outdated. The agents are appealing. 
Conservative groups also said U.S. workers might be able to 
bring a case if they can prove they were displaced by immigrants granted new work permits. 
""We will be looking for people who can demonstratively prove that aliens who are getting work documents are working in similar fields,"" Stein from FAIR said. 
The suit filed Thursday by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio - whose police force has been sued for racial profiling of immigrants - is short on legal reasoning and is likely to be dismissed, said Kari Hong a Boston College Law School professor. 
""At this point it's all rhetoric. It's not based in strong legal analysis,"" Hong said. 
Short of legal action, states could move to withhold 
benefits to recipients of the new status. But immigration advocates are likely to counter those moves with their own suits, potentially clogging the courts with more cases related to Obama's order. 

After the deportation relief was announced in 2012, Arizona, Nebraska and Michigan all blocked young recipients from obtaining drivers licenses. Immigrants sued in all three states.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday filed a long-anticipated lawsuit challenging the implementation of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law over employer-based coverage and payments to insurers, according to court documents. 
The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in Washington against the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Treasury, targets a decision to delay implementation of the law's employer mandate, which requires employers with more than 50 employees to offer healthcare coverage. 
It also challenges a provision of the law that authorizes Treasury payments to health insurance companies. 
House Speaker John Boehner, in a statement, said that Obama had bypassed Congress to take ""unilateral actions"" when implementing the healthcare law, also known as Obamacare. 
""If the president can get away with making his own laws, future presidents will have the ability to as well. The House has an obligation to stand up for the Constitution,"" Boehner said. 
Jonathan Turley, the lead counsel for House Republicans on the lawsuit, said in a Friday blog post that the president's actions blurred the lines between branches of government and usurped the ability of Congress to use the ""power of purse"" during the appropriations process. 

The House had passed a resolution in July authorizing the lawsuit.

He indicated Obama's decision to use his executive authority and bypass the U.S. Congress, where immigration legislation has stalled, could taint future efforts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama imposed the most sweeping immigration reform in a generation on Thursday, easing the threat of deportation for some 4.7 million undocumented immigrants and setting up a clash with Republicans who vow to fight his moves. 
In a White House speech, Obama rejected Republican arguments that his decision to bypass Congress and take executive action was tantamount to amnesty for illegal immigrants. 
It was his biggest use of executive actions in a year in which they have become his signature way of working around congressional gridlock. 
""Amnesty is the immigration system we have today, millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules,"" he said. 
Republicans pounced quickly, charging Obama had overstepped his constitutional powers a year after declaring he did not have the authority to act on his own. 
In a video released before Obama's televised speech, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said: The president has said before that ‘he's not king' and he's ‘not an emperor,' but he sure is acting like one."" 
With 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, Obama's plan would let some 4.4 million who are parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents remain in the country temporarily, without the threat of deportation. 
Those undocumented residents could apply legally for jobs and join American society, but not vote or qualify for insurance under the president's healthcare law. The measure would apply to those who have been in the United States for at last five years. 
An additional 270,000 people would be eligible for relief under the expansion of a 2012 move by Obama to stop deporting people brought illegally to the United States as children by their parents. 
MIXED REACTIONS 
The president, speaking two weeks after he and his Democrats were trounced in midterm elections, appeared confident and determined at the White House podium. Outside, pro-migrant demonstrators watched his speech on their smartphones and chanted support for him. 
""Si se puede (Yes we can),"" they shouted and sang the American national anthem. 
Obama urged Republicans not to take steps against his plan that could lead to a government shutdown, raising the specter of a crisis that some conservatives would like to push but Republican leaders of Congress want to avoid. 
Republicans were blamed for a shutdown over spending a year ago and are seeking ways to deny funding for his immigration steps without provoking a year-end budget crisis. 
""Congress certainly shouldn't shut down our government again just because we disagree on this,"" Obama said. 
Obama's moves have ramifications for the campaign to succeed him in 2016 by possibly solidifying Hispanic support behind Democrats. Republican candidates may tread carefully around the issue to avoid a Latino backlash. But polls show many Americans would prefer Obama not act alone. 
Obama said trying to deport all 11 million people living in the country illegally was not realistic. His voice took on an empathetic tone as he described the struggle of illegal immigrants to avoid getting deported. 
""I've seen the heartbreak and anxiety of children whose mothers might be taken away from them just because they didn't have the right papers,"" he said. 
But Michael McCaul, Republican chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, warned: ""We will see a wave of illegal immigration because of the president's actions, and in no way is the Department of Homeland Security prepared to handle such a surge."" 
He pledged to ""use every tool at my disposal to stop the president's unconstitutional actions from being implemented."" 
Lindolfo Carballo of Arlington, Virginia, who was among the demonstrators outside the White House, said: ""It is personal for him (Obama), I think."" 
Nearby, a smaller group protested Obama's action. 
""This is illegal, what he's doing,"" said Manny Vega, a retired U.S. Marines sergeant from Fredericksburg, Virginia. 
'PASS A BILL' 
Obama said his actions were the kinds of steps taken by Republican and Democratic presidents for the past half century. 
""And to those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer: Pass a bill,"" he said. 
Administration officials described Obama's actions as the biggest shift in immigration policy since 1986 changes enacted during President Ronald Reagan's administration. 
Some legal analysts said Congress could struggle to win a lawsuit to overturn the action since presidents have historically had broad authority to act on immigration. 

""When an issue is mostly political, the judicial branch generally is not going to want to step in the middle of a dispute between the executive branch and the legislature,"" said Ted Ruthizer, an immigration attorney at Kramer Levin.

Hillary Clinton, who lost the Democratic nomination to Obama in 2008 and is expected to make a run to be the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, issued a statement supporting Obama's plan but urging Congress to ""finish the job."" 
It was an unusual step for Clinton, who has mainly stayed away from putting out statements on political issues since she stepped down as Obama's secretary of state in 2013. 
Clinton blamed the Republican-led House of Representatives for an ""abdication of responsibility"" on immigration.

""It is time for Republican leaders in Congress to act. We must demonstrate to Americans we are the party that will tackle serious challenges and build broad-based consensus to achieve meaningful reforms for our citizens and our future,"" said Bush, whose brother and father both held the office of president. 
Even before Obama announced his immigration order, Republican governors at a conference in Florida were debating how best to react, looking ahead to 2016. 

Several potential GOP presidential candidates such as Ohio Governor John Kasich, New Jersey's Chris Christie and Wisconsin's Scott Walker warned congressional Republicans against shutting down the U.S. government in response to Obama's actions.

252,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2014 08:35PM ET</span>","Republicans united in anger at Obama, not on immigration response","By David Lawder 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Outrage may be the only thing that unites Republicans over President Barack Obama's immigration order. 
While their blood is boiling over his decision to allow nearly 5 million undocumented immigrants to stay and work in the United States, they remain deeply divided over how to stop it. 
In dozens of statements, speeches and interviews, Republicans have called Obama an ""emperor,"" a ""king"", a ""partisan bomb-thrower"" and a violator of the U.S. Constitution. 
But a heated argument is raging among Republicans in Congress over the best response, with a sizable and vocal group of conservatives pressing to use a must-pass government spending bill to withhold funding for implementation of Obama's order easing deportation rules for millions of undocumented residents. 
The move, one of the few options Republicans believe could be effective, comes at a high price: threatening another government shutdown that party leaders have vowed to avoid, just over a year after a 16-day closure inflicted heavy political damage on Republicans. 
""The only method I know to deal with this, outside of legal proceedings, is the power of the purse string,"" said Republican Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas. 
The looming battle will be an early test of Republican congressional leaders and their ability to keep their sometimes unruly conservative caucuses in line after big midterm election wins that will give the party control of the Senate and an expanded House of Representatives majority beginning in January. 
Republican leaders hope to show they are ready to govern, but some lawmakers will not make it easy. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas already called for blocking all of Obama's nominations in the next Congress until the action on immigration is rescinded, while Rep. Steve King of Iowa has said impeachment is ""still on the table."" 
Other suggestions from Republicans have ranged from filing a lawsuit to block the executive action to crafting separate immigration legislation that would override the president's order. 
House Speaker John Boehner last week declined to rule out a shutdown battle and vowed to fight Obama ""tooth and nail"" over the immigration order, but has said little this week about the strategy. 
Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, said he would defer to whatever funding plan Boehner settled on. 
""We're considering a variety of options,"" McConnell said on Thursday. ""But make no mistake. When the newly elected representatives of the people take their seats, they will act."" 
Hal Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, argued on Thursday that a 'de-funding' plan will not work because the agency primarily responsible for processing immigrants, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, is funded almost entirely by application fees. 
Similar arguments made in the run-up to last year's government shutdown fell largely on deaf ears as House Republicans tried to starve Obama's healthcare program. 
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said the president would face a popular backlash and Republicans should not short-circuit the public response. 

""Impeaching the president or shutting down the government are bad responses, inappropriate responses to an immature decision by this president,"" he told reporters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for South Carolina to become the 35th U.S. state where gay marriage is legal, denying a request to block same-same weddings from proceeding. 
The order was another victory for gay marriage advocates after a federal judge in Montana on Wednesday struck down that state's ban on same-sex marriage. 
""We're really thrilled,"" said Jeff Ayers, board chairman of South Carolina Equality. ""This proves that all the way to the highest court, these were our rights from the beginning."" 
South Carolina's attorney general had asked the high court to temporarily block a lower court's ruling that overturned the state's ban. 
After the Supreme Court's order, South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, a Republican, said he hoped the high court, which has so far declined to take up cases that would lead to a definitive ruling on gay marriage, would ultimately uphold the ban. 
Gay marriage advocates in Louisiana said on Thursday they had joined those asking the high court to rule on the issue. 
There are already cases involving bans in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee pending at the court, which will likely decide by the end of the year whether to hear one or more of them. 
The South Carolina ban was struck down last week by U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel, who ruled the state was bound by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision striking down a similar law in Virginia. 
Gergel put his ruling on hold for a week to allow the state to appeal, with the 4th Circuit on Tuesday refusing to block it. 
In Montana, where U.S. District Judge Brian Morris overturned that state's ban on same-sex marriage as unconstitutional, dozens of couples married at county courthouses on Thursday. 
A lesbian couple who successfully challenged the prohibition were the first to receive a marriage license at the Cascade County Courthouse in Great Falls, said Amy Cannata of the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana. 
While gay marriage advocates have had the upper hand in the courts in the past year, a Cincinnati-based federal appeals court on Nov. 6 became the first to uphold gay marriage bans. 

That decision by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals created a split within the courts, increasing the chances the Supreme Court will rule on the issue.

""I made this decision after reflecting on numerous political commentaries and listening to many knowledgeable people,"" he said. ""I look forward to listening and talking with more people in the coming months as I decide whether or not to run."" 
By forming an exploratory committee, Webb is not committing to a full-scale campaign, but formally acknowledging his interest in pursuing the White House. 
A Vietnam veteran who left the Senate in 2013 and who previously served as Secretary of the Navy under Republican President Ronald Reagan between 1987 and 1988, Webb is considered a long shot to win the Democratic nomination. 
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who has said she will decide whether or not to run in early 2015, is widely regarded as the frontrunner. 

""With enough financial support to conduct a first-class campaign, I have no doubt that we can put these issues squarely before the American people and gain their support,"" he wrote, acknowledging he has no full-time campaign staff, and listing problems from income inequality and faltering American infrastructure to ""reducing ill-considered foreign ventures.""

The bill, sponsored by Republican John Thune and Democrat Bill Nelson, ""is intended to incentivize whistleblowers from the automotive sector to voluntarily provide information to the U.S. Department of Transportation to prevent deaths and serious physical injuries by identifying problems much earlier than would have otherwise been possible,"" Thune's spokeswoman, AshLee Strong said. 
The measure will cover ""original information"" not previously known to the government ""relating to any motor vehicle defect, noncompliance, or any violation of any reporting requirement that is likely to cause risk of death or serious physical injury,"" Strong's statement added. 
The Senate holds a hearing on Thursday into how regulators and the auto industry have handled a rapidly expanding recall of millions of potentially defective air bags manufactured by Japan's Takata Corp. 
Safety advocates have criticized the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for not responding more quickly to years of evidence about the deadly defect. 
The top U.S. auto safety regulator was similarly criticized for its sluggish response to more than a decade of evidence that millions of General Motors Co vehicles were equipped with a potentially deadly ignition switch flaw. 

Under the Thune-Nelson bill, the transportation secretary would have the discretion to award whistleblowers up to 30 percent of monetary penalties from U.S. enforcement actions totaling more than $1 million. The measure would cover employees or contractors of automakers, parts suppliers and dealerships.

258,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2014 03:55AM ET</span>",Immigrants face major hurdles in signing up to new Obama plan,"By Lawrence Hurley and Mica Rosenberg 
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's televised address to the nation on Thursday may prove the easiest part of his controversial plan to relax U.S. immigration policy. Implementing it will be difficult and many people may never benefit, warn immigration lawyers. 
Sources close to the administration say Obama will announce that some parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents are to be given a reprieve from deportation. Up to 5 million people could benefit from the move. 
But immigration advocacy groups say they don't have sufficient resources to provide legal services to their existing clients, never mind the millions of potential new ones. Obama's proposal is not expected to provide for federal funding for attorneys to guide immigrants through the process. 
""If the past is any indication, it's going to be a significant increase in people asking for legal assistance,"" said Karla McKanders, who runs the immigration law clinic at the University of Tennessee College of Law in Knoxville. 
The new plan is expected to be similar to Obama's 2012 executive action, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), that halted deportation and granted work permits to immigrants brought illegally to the country as young children. 
McKanders said she and her students were already swamped because of DACA. In many parts of the United States, especially rural areas, there are either not enough private immigration lawyers or they are not affordable to most undocumented immigrants. 
Only 55 percent of the estimated 1.2 million young people eligible under DACA have applied, according to an August report by the Migration Policy Institute. 
There is another problem. Immigrants who have lived illegally in the United States for many years can be afraid to sign up or lack the proper documentation to back up their claims, said Jacqueline Rishty from the Immigration Legal Services Program of Catholic Charities in Washington. 
The lack of immigration lawyers also opens the door for self-described legal experts who give bad advice or even scam clients out of thousands of dollars. The American Bar Association has warned of fraudsters offering legal services in Spanish-speaking communities. 
""I think this is going to be a prime opportunity for folks to be scammed,"" said Adolfo Hernandez who works on immigrant affairs in the Chicago mayor's office. 
PAPERWORK HELP 
Formal legal advice is not always needed to process immigration applications and many people will likely file on their own, but some, especially those who lack English language or literacy skills, will need help from people with at least some legal training to fill out the paperwork. 
Good legal representation can make a huge difference in some of the tougher cases, said Chief Judge Robert Katzmann of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in a speech on Wednesday in New York. 
For immigrants who can't afford to pay for legal help, cities with big immigrant populations are already gearing up to help immigrants potentially eligible under Obama's plan. 
New York City, for example, is getting ready by talking to private foundations about providing fund for legal aid and outreach. The city spent $18 million over two years on subway ads and other measures to help implement DACA. 
""The plan to act may come from the federal level, but ultimately the responsibility falls on cities to step up and ensure the successful implementation of the program,"" said New York City's Commissioner of Immigrant Affairs Nisha Agarwal. 

Chicago is also planning to spread the word about legal services by sending information home with public school children.

259,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2014 01:21AM ET</span>",Obama's immigration move expected to leave out millions of childless adults,"By Julia Edwards 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Most Friday nights, in the Denver suburb of Arvada, Ramon Madera invites his sister Angelica and her three children over to his home for dinner and games. It's a tradition that became all the more important after the children's father was deported back to Mexico about five years ago. 
Lately, conversations on game night have taken an anxious turn: Madera himself was apprehended by immigration enforcement agents in September and is due in court for a deportation hearing next June. 
Madera, 36, said that while he may be a father figure to Angelica's children, as a gay man who has no children of his own he is unlikely to benefit from the executive action President Barack Obama is expected to announce on Thursday night. His deportation hearing will probably go ahead as scheduled. 
""I'm like the dad of the family,"" said Madera. ""If they need money, they ask me. If they aren't sure if they should do something, they call me. For every thing, every opinion, they come to me."" 
Obama, seeking to give legal status to some of the more than 11 million immigrants without documents in the United States, is likely to focus on keeping nuclear families together by granting temporary relief from deportation to parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents. 
The Migration Policy Institute estimates that around 6.5 million people are like Madera, undocumented immigrant adults living in the United States without children. 
Angelica's daughter and two sons are U.S. citizens, so she will likely be granted relief. But she worries about how she will provide for her family if her brother is deported. 
She was laid off from a factory job around a year ago and has been supporting her family on wages from sporadic cleaning jobs and help from her brother. 
Madera has been collecting letters from his family members to take to the judge at his deportation hearing and make a case that he is a good person on whom they depend. 
FAMILY-CENTERED POLICIES 
A policy focused on keeping nuclear families together is an easier sell for Obama in a political climate where Republicans are eager to block any presidential action. Republicans, who take over full control of Congress in January, largely view relief from deportation as amnesty for people who broke U.S. immigration law. 
Family-centered policies have long been deemed palatable to American voters, said Marshall Fitz, director of immigration policy at the Center for American Progress. 
""The idea of a kid growing up without his parent is hard to swallow. We've had a history in this country of adopting policies that are pro-family unification."" Fitz added he thought policies should focus not just on family connections but also on rootedness, or ties to the community. 
Madera said he felt much like an American citizen until he was apprehended before boarding a domestic flight in September. He has been living in the United States since 1994 and pays taxes with the money he earns from his business as a house painter and tree trimmer. 
He spent 24 days in detention before being released on bond. 
For people like him, whose day in court is scheduled and for whom no relief is in sight, the fear of deportation is likely to continue to be a reality. 

Immigrant advocacy groups are likely to use stories such as Madera's to try to pressure Congress to reform the immigration system through legislation, rather than through executive actions singling out certain categories for deportation relief.

260,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2014 12:18AM ET</span>","U.S. states get more, spend more on Medicaid under Obamacare: report","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One part of the Affordable Care Act is going according to plan, with U.S. states receiving and spending more money on the Medicaid health insurance program, a report released by the National Association of State Budget Officers on Thursday showed. 
States run Medicaid, which serves families who have low incomes, and receive partial reimbursements from the federal government. The healthcare overhaul known as Obamacare allowed more people to enroll in Medicaid and also gave states 90 percent to 100 percent reimbursements for new enrollees. 
""The large increase in federal funds to states in fiscal 2014 was almost solely due to additional Medicaid dollars, mainly resulting from the expansion of Medicaid in a majority of states under the Affordable Care Act,"" the association found. ""While federal Medicaid funds to states increased $41.8 billion in fiscal 2014, all other federal funds to states are estimated to have declined $3.4 billion."" 
For most states, fiscal 2014 ended on June 30. 
Medicaid spending rose the most of all states' budget areas, increasing 11.3 percent in fiscal 2014, but the federal government shouldered most of the burden. Federal funding for Medicaid increased 17.8 percent, and state dollars directed to the program only grew 2.7 percent, according to NASBO. 
Before Obamacare, Medicaid had each year eaten up a larger portion of state spending. In fiscal 2014, it was states' biggest budget item, consuming slightly more than a quarter of all state expenditures. Elementary and secondary education, though, remains the largest category of spending exclusively from state funds, representing 24.2 percent of state funds, compared to 15.3 percent for Medicaid. 
States have become less reliant on federal funds since the U.S. stimulus plan expired and Congress enacted ""sequestration"" spending cuts. When the stimulus plan's infusion of cash ended in fiscal 2010, federal funds represented 34.9 percent of state spending. In fiscal 2014 federal funds backed 30.3 percent of state spending. 
NASBO found spending in almost all budget categories edged up slightly last fiscal year, with only the ""all other"" and public assistance categories declining. Higher education spending rose 3.7 percent, corrections increased 4 percent, and transportation was up 2.7 percent. 
""Looking forward, states remain concerned about both the short- and long-term outlook due to increased spending demands, recent volatility in states revenues, and uncertainty surrounding future federal fiscal policies,"" NASBO found.

261,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2014 09:07PM ET</span>",Some Senate Democrats balk at Obama's unilateral immigration approach,"By Susan Cornwell 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several Democratic senators are uncomfortable with President Barack Obama's decision to use executive action to make immigration reform, raising the possibility of open, bipartisan resistance to his plan. 
The senators, most from conservative states, objected to Obama's unilateral approach, saying on Wednesday that they preferred Congress to take the lead with legislation. Democrats should try again to work with Republicans in Congress to set reforms in law, many said. 
No Democrats went so far as to say they were ready to break with the president, but several were critical of his go-it-alone approach. 
""I wish he wouldn't do it,"" Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia said. ""I think we ought to work through this process, and with the new elections and the results of the elections, we ought to try in January to see if we can find a pathway to get something accomplished."" 
Republicans, who after midterm election gains will take control of the Senate in January, have uniformly condemned Obama's plan to give deportation relief to as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants. They are considering ways to resist. 
Any defections in Obama's own party would make that resistance bipartisan, further isolating the president and potentially making it even more difficult to pass other items on his agenda. 
If six or seven Democratic votes in the new Senate joined Republicans, they would have the 60 needed to block the executive order and force Obama into a politically embarrassing veto. 
Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri said she supported comprehensive immigration reform but was concerned by Obama's plan. ""I have to be honest, how this is coming about makes me uncomfortable, I think it probably makes most Missourians uncomfortable."" 
The Senate in June 2013 passed a sweeping, bipartisan immigration bill, but the Republican-led House of Representatives did not take it up. Obama said the Republican refusal to move on immigration was forcing his action, to be announced in a televised address on Thursday. 
Democratic Senator Jon Tester of Montana said he would like to see Congress try again. 
""I would prefer the Congress acted, yes,"" Tester said. ""I think it would be great to have the House take up the Senate-passed bill …. That would be a solution to the problem."" 
Manchin also said he would like to see the House tackle the issue again, and ""if that's not going to happen, then we've got to find another way to work this."" 
A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said on Wednesday that Obama's executive action would ruin the chances of Congress acting on immigration. 
Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, has been supportive of immigration reform but critical of unilateral action by Obama. A spokesman for King said the senator had conveyed his position to the White House earlier this week. 
Some Republican conservatives have suggested placing funding restrictions on Obama's plan in a must-pass government spending bill, which could lead to a government shutdown that Republican leaders have vowed to avoid. Other approaches include passing targeted bills to defund implementation of the order. 
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina predicted the instinct for ""political survival"" would force some unhappy Democrats to join Republicans in trying to defund Obama's executive action. 
""There will be some Democrats who will join the effort to limit an overreach of executive authority,"" Graham said. 
""Some will be genuinely upset, a lot of it will be political survival, like in purple and red states,"" he said, referring to the colors commonly used to designate conservative-leaning and swing states. 
Moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine said Obama was making ""a huge mistake from both the political and policy perspective."" 

Asked if any Democrats agreed with her, Collins said: ""I know for a fact that they do.""

263,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2014 07:20PM ET</span>","Obama to act unilaterally on immigration, irking Republicans","By Steve Holland and Richard Cowan 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will outline a plan on Thursday to relax U.S. immigration policy for as many as 5 million people, bypassing Congress and angering Republicans. 
U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, the leading Republican voice on fiscal policy and a potential 2016 presidential candidate, called the plan a ""partisan bomb"" while a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner branded the president ""Emperor Obama"" for acting unilaterally. 
The White House said Obama will deliver a televised speech at 8 p.m. ET on Thursday (0100 GMT Friday) laying out the plan followed by a trip to Las Vegas on Friday. Nevada is home to the highest proportion of undocumented immigrants. 
Frustrated by years of congressional inaction on what most in Washington agree is a broken immigration system, Obama said he is now prepared to use his executive authority. 
Obama's directives are expected to remove the threat of deportation for as many as 5 million of the estimated 11 million people living illegally in the United States. 
The decision will cement his legacy as having aided Hispanics who helped elect him in 2008 and who have become increasingly vocal in their frustration that he has failed to live up to his promise to enact immigration reform. 
The unilateral overhaul will likely have a ripple effect on the campaign to find a successor to the president in 2016. While Hispanics will no doubt be pleased, Democrats could face a backlash from voters. 
Reaction was swift from Republicans who took control of the Senate in Nov. 4 elections and strengthened their grip on the House of Representatives. 
While liberal Democrats were thrilled at Obama's decision to move ahead, some moderate voices in Obama's party were uneasy. 
""I wish he wouldn't do it,"" said Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. ""I just wish he wouldn't do it."" 
Obama will host 18 congressional Democrats at the White House to consolidate support for his immigration plans among his closest allies on Capitol Hill. 
Some conservative Republicans have threatened to fight the immigration move by imposing funding restrictions in a must-pass spending bill, which could conceivably lead to a government shutdown. 
Republican leaders, however, have stressed they will not allow a shutdown after facing heavy criticism for the last one a year ago. 
House Republicans are weighing a range of responses to register their disapproval. 
""If 'Emperor Obama' ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for congressional action on this issue and many others,"" said Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner. 
For a president known for having deported thousands of illegal migrants, the actions he will take mark a dramatic shift in course, although advocacy groups will argue that he should go even further in protecting more people who work low-paying jobs that many American citizens prefer not to do. 
Sources close to the administration said Obama is planning to issue a reprieve from deportation that will cover some parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. 
That initiative would expand on a 2012 executive order by the president that gave relief from deportation and work permits to undocumented children brought to the United States by their parents. 
There is also expected to be a border security element and Obama will act to help companies hire and retain high-skilled workers from abroad, the sources said. 
Obama's move is his most defiant step yet in reaction to the elections handing control of the Senate to Republicans. The new political order in Washington will test Obama's ability to make compromises with his opponents. 
An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found 48 percent would prefer Obama not act on his own, while 38 percent support it and 14 percent had no opinion or were unsure. 
The last major immigration overhaul that expanded the number of legal migrants was in 1986 through legislation signed by Republican President Ronald Reagan. An attempt by President George W. Bush in 2007 for immigration reform failed. 
It is not out of the question that Obama early next year could offer to approve the long-stalled Keystone XL pipeline from Canada in exchange for a deal on immigration legislation. 

Despite claims that Obama may overstep his executive powers, Stephen Legomsky, a former U.S. immigration official who is now a professor at Washington University law school, said the president's planned action appeared to fit well within the bounds of established law and prosecutorial discretion.

BOCA RATON Florida (Reuters) - Republican governors huddling in Florida on Wednesday warned fellow conservatives in Washington against shutting down the U.S. government in response to President Barack Obama's expected move to ease immigration policy. 
Obama's plan to grant deportation relief for up to 5 million undocumented immigrants was the talk of the Republican Governors Association conference, where 25 governors gathered to celebrate sweeping victories in the midterm elections and plot a path forward. 
""No! No! They're not going to shut the government down,"" Ohio governor John Kasich told Reuters. 
""It's not even an issue. It's not going to happen,"" said the former congressman, who is often mentioned as a potential presidential candidate in 2016 after a big re-election win. 
Kasich and several other Republican governors who may be considering a presidential run said they were wary of a strategy pushed by some conservatives on Capitol Hill who want to use a must-pass bill to fund the government as leverage to fight Obama on the immigration plan. 
Such a measure could set up a battle like the one that led to the 16-day government shutdown in October 2013. 
While Republican leaders have said they do not intend to get into such a fight, the governors in Florida still spoke out against that prospect. 
""All this hysteria about a shutdown to me is just people looking to make news,"" said New Jersey's Chris Christie, who also spoke to incoming Republican lawmakers in Washington on Monday. 
""I think this Republican Congress and this new leadership will do what they need to do to make sure the government runs and operates and continues to go,"" he added. 
Wisconsin's Scott Walker, also seen as a White House aspirant, echoed conservative calls for a possible lawsuit against Obama, but he stopped short of calling for a shutdown fight. 
""I wouldn't push a shutdown,"" said Walker, who this month won his third election in the swing-state of Wisconsin. ""I think you go to court."" 
Kasich, who spent 18 years in the U.S. House of Representatives and unsuccessfully ran for president in 2000, said if he were still in Washington he would urge congressional leaders to be in contact with Obama soon. 

""What I would be saying to the leaders is: 'Go down to the White House one more time and see if you can get him to put this off until we can write something together.'""

265,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2014 07:11PM ET</span>","In new role, Republican Paul Ryan takes aim at tax reform","By David Lawder 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, the leading Republican voice on fiscal policy, vowed on Wednesday to start overhauling the U.S. tax code despite Washington gridlock that he says will worsen with President Barack Obama's planned immigration order. 
The candidate for vice president in Mitt Romney's 2012 White House bid, Ryan was confirmed by Republicans on Wednesday as chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee overseeing government funding and taxes from January when the new Congress takes office. 
In an interview Ryan told Reuters that Obama's plan to relax immigration policy for as many as 5 million people was a ""partisan bomb"" that would hamper any effort to work with Congress on tax reform and other issues. 
Obama's move would be so polarizing as to make it difficult to achieve Ryan's goal of overhauling the complex U.S. tax code, Ryan said, but he was determined not to wait for a new president to make progress on tax reform. 
""I don't like the idea of waiting yet another two years for progress. We in Congress are going to act and we're going to move on jobs and the economy which is what people want us to work on. We're going to work on that whether we have a willing partner who wants to be bipartisan,"" he said. 
Ryan, 44, of Wisconsin, is the lone House of Representatives member viewed as a presidential contender in 2016. He is a favorite of Wall Street donors and has a record also of working with Obama's Democrats. 
He has raised Democrats' ire with proposals for deep cuts in federal benefits, but he and Democratic Senator Patty Murray managed to lessen budget cuts in 2014 and 2015 by forging a deal economists cite as a reason the U.S. economy has accelerated. 
NO TO A SHUTDOWN 
Ryan insisted Republicans would not shut down federal agencies despite a call from many House conservatives who want to deny funds needed to carry out Obama's immigration order. 
Like many other Republicans, Ryan has called for closing tax breaks that distort economic decisions and using the money to lower tax rates, which they say will boost economic growth. 
Ryan's predecessor as Ways and Means chairman, Dave Camp, last year floated an ambitious plan to reduce tax brackets to just three from seven now, with rates of 10, 25 and 35 percent. But the math required cutting back on popular tax breaks for long-term capital gains and dividends, mortgage interest and college tuition. It drew criticism from both parties. 
Broad tax reform is seen by analysts as unlikely to be achieved so long as Obama wields the veto. There may be more weight, however, behind corporate tax reform in the face of a backlash against companies moving overseas to lower tax bills. 
Ryan declined to discuss specifics on his plans to attack tax reform in a polarized Washington. 
""It's not a question of if, it's a question of when, and what I would say is it's somewhere between one and three years from getting done,"" he said. ""The sooner the better in my mind, but we'll see what kind of atmosphere we have to work with."" 
The last U.S. tax code overhaul was in 1986 when Republican Ronald Reagan was president and Democrats controlled the House of Representatives. 
Like Obama and Democrat Hillary Clinton, Ryan has written a book. But he said he would only decide next year on a run for president. ""That's something I've long reserved for 2015,"" Ryan said. ""You'll know when I know. I'll let you know.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Tuesday nominated transportation expert Mark Rosekind to lead the top U.S. auto safety regulator, which has come under criticism this year for a perceived slow response to major scandals. 
Rosekind, if confirmed by the Senate, would come to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) after spending the past four years as a member of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the agency that investigates major transportation accidents. 
The White House announced the nomination on the eve of a Senate hearing into how regulators and the auto industry have handled a rapidly expanding recall of millions of potentially defective air bags manufactured by Japan's Takata Corp. 
The air bags, which can rupture upon deployment and spray metal shards into cars, have been linked to at least five deaths. 
Safety advocates have criticized NHTSA for not responding more quickly to years of evidence about the deadly defect. 
The agency was similarly criticized for its sluggish response to more than a decade of evidence that millions of General Motors Co vehicles were equipped with a potentially deadly ignition switch flaw. 
Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a leading NHTSA critic, called Rosekind's nomination ""long overdue"" and said he hoped it ""will breathe new life into this battered and beleaguered agency."" 
NHTSA has been lacking a permanent head since David Strickland resigned in December 2013. Deputy Administrator David Friedman has been running NHTSA in the interim. 
According to the NTSB's biography of Rosekind, he is ""one of the world's foremost human fatigue experts"" and a founder of Alertness Solutions, a consulting firm that specializes in fatigue management. 
Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said he was surprised the nominee didn't have a background in auto safety. 
""Given the GM ignition switch and now Takata I would have expected someone with more of a hands-on experience in vehicle safety,"" Ditlow said. 
Senator John Thune, the top Republican on the committee that will consider the nomination, said he looked forward to hearing Rosekind's ""plans to address the rising number of motor vehicle safety recalls."" 
Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx called Rosekind ""a leader ready-made for this critical responsibility,"" and said he expects him to hold the auto industry accountable. 

It is unclear if the Senate will consider the nomination before its planned adjournment for the year in mid-December.

State leaders on Tuesday requested $86.1 million in spending from Dec. 1 through August for the border deployment that includes up to 1,000 National Guard troops. 
Dewhurst said at a news conference at the capitol in Austin that while the National Guard presence is being drawn down, there would be an enhanced presence of Department of Public Safety officers along the border, the Austin American-Statesman reported. 
""The surge is working,"" Dewhurst, a Republican, said. 
Texas Governor Rick Perry, a possible Republican candidate in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, announced the National Guard deployment in mid-2014 when a flood of unaccompanied minors from Central America was coming across the border. 
Perry and Dewhurst said the surge of Texas lawmen and troops was needed because the Obama administration was not doing enough to protect the border. Dewhurst said on Wednesday the surge has led to a decrease in criminal activity in the region. 
But Democrats have questioned the deployment, saying data show the flow of children was slowing before the Texas surge even started and that federal crime statistics indicate the border region has been one of the safer places in the state for years. 
They also note that more U.S. Border Patrol agents have been assigned to the border region and the National Guard does not have the power to arrest, raising questions about what the troops are doing. 
The Mexican government said Perry was trying to manipulate border security for his own political purposes with the National Guard troop deployment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Climate change resonates with voters more on a local than a national level, billionaire hedge fund trader turned Democratic fundraiser Tom Steyer said Wednesday, reflecting on the 2014 mid-term elections. 
Steyer made a splash ahead of this month's elections, spending over $70 million to back candidates who took strong positions on climate change policy in key congressional and gubernatorial races. 
But the spending of his NextGen Climate Action political committee yielded mixed results, with just three wins for strong climate advocates out of the seven candidates backed. 
Discussing the results, Steyer said what was clear that Tuesday was that local angles about the impact of climate change resonated more with voters. 
""If you talk in generalities, if you talk from the point of view of the globe and the point of view of science, you are in a lot of trouble,"" Steyer told a conference hosted by the liberal Center for American Progress.

Some Steyer-backed candidates lost heavily, including Colorado incumbent U.S. Senator Mark Udall and Iowa's U.S. Senate hopeful Bruce Braley. Critics declared that Steyer's bet on climate had flopped. 
Oklahoma U.S. Senator James Inhofe, a climate change denier who will take over as chair of the Senate environment committee in January, has said the mid-terms proved that voters rejected climate change as a priority issue. 
As election day approached, NextGen and other green groups were pivoting away from climate in their ads, switching to issues like job creation, corruption and reproductive rights. 
Looking ahead to the 2016 elections, Steyer said he feels a candidate cannot run on a platform that doesn't recognize climate change as a problem. 
""There aren't too many science deniers anymore because they can't get elected,"" he said. 
When asked about the 14 Democratic Senators who on Tuesday joined Republicans to support a bill to green-light the Keystone XL pipeline, which fell one vote short of passage, Steyer paused, and then said:

269,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2014 04:30PM ET</span>",U.S. top trade official optimistic on fast-track power,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said on Wednesday he still hopes for bipartisan support in Congress on granting the White House the authority to fast track trade deals but added the timing was up to lawmakers. 
Congress has yet to consider a Trade Promotion Authority bill, introduced in January, that would prevent lawmakers from amending trade deals in exchange for setting negotiating objectives. 
Some experts say trading partners will not put up their best offers if Congress can later pick apart the deal and that the lack of TPA is slowing down Pacific trade talks. 
Asked about the prospect that Congress does not pass TPA and the United States is unable to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Froman said: ""I don't consider that possibility."" 
USTR officials had been working with Democrats and Republicans in Congress for months to produce ""a bill that could get bipartisan support whenever the opportunity in Congress arises for that to be taken up,"" Froman said at a Wilson Center event, stressing that the timing was up to congressional leaders. 
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat who controls which bills come to the floor, had been unwilling to move on TPA before mid-term elections earlier this month. 
But he said on Tuesday he would be ""happy to take a look"" at a fast-track bill. At the same time, however, the head of the Senate committee responsible for the legislation, fellow Democrat Ron Wyden, said that Congress had little time left this year and his committee had other priorities. 
Froman said he was optimistic about working with Republicans, who will control both the House and Senate next year, on a trade agenda which includes a deal with Europe as well as the 12-nation TPP, a key part of the U.S. administration's engagement with Asia. 
One stumbling block to finishing TPP has been a stalemate with Japan over tariffs on agricultural imports, and Froman said news the world's third-biggest economy unexpectedly slipped back into recession might drive home the need for reforms in Japan and give the TPP more impetus. 
Manufacturers said on Wednesday Congress should also urgently pass legislation to cut tariffs on raw materials and inputs for U.S.-made goods. 

Tariff cuts in the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill expired in 2013 and further delay would cost factories $748 million in extra taxes over three years, the National Association of Manufacturers said.

270,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2014 03:28PM ET</span>",Secret Service chief says agency 'severely damaged' by lapses,"By Will Dunham 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The acting head of the U.S. Secret Service said on Wednesday that the agency charged with protecting the president had been ""severely damaged"" by harmful lapses, including allowing a knife-carrying man to jump a fence and run into the White House in September. 
Joseph Clancy told the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee he had sought to establish a culture of trust within the Secret Service since replacing Julia Pierson, who resigned under fire as director on Oct. 1. 
A lack of trust had driven some employees to take concerns about internal problems to people outside the Secret Service rather than trusting their supervisors and the agency leadership to confront issues head-on, Clancy said. 
In his first congressional testimony since becoming acting director, Clancy noted ""an urgent need"" to re-establish what he called one of the most basic tenets of a well-functioning workplace: ""Trust your boss that he will stand up and do the right thing."" 
An internal review released last week found that an intruder was able to scale the White House fence and enter the main floor of the building on Sept. 19 because of major Secret Service failures, including an agent distracted by a personal cellphone call. 
The incident involving Iraq war veteran Omar Gonzalez was one of the worst security breaches since President Barack Obama took office in 2009. 
""Without question, the agency has been severely damaged in recent years by failures ranging from disgraceful misconduct on the part of some employees to operational breakdowns that undermine the trust and confidence that previous generations worked so hard to establish,"" Clancy testified. 
Clancy called the report on the Sept. 19 incident ""devastating."" 
""Although I firmly believe that the Secret Service is better than this incident, I openly acknowledge that a failure of this magnitude - especially in light of other recent incidents - requires immediate action and longer-term reform,"" Clancy added. 
Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican, said incidents including the Gonzalez one ""give me great concern that the policies, procedures and training at the Secret Service are not entirely up to the task. 

""Others include the Columbian prostitution scandal, the recent ability of a security guard with a criminal history to take a service weapon into an elevator with the president and the incident in the Netherlands dealing with intoxicated Secret Service agents,"" Goodlatte added.

272,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2014 01:17PM ET</span>",U.S. government proposes more transparency in clinical trials,"(Reuters) - U.S. health officials on Wednesday proposed significantly expanding what researchers are required to report about clinical trials of drugs, devices, and other interventions, addressing concerns that data crucial to patients and physicians is kept secret. 
The rules, which are open for public comment until Feb. 19, apply to the database ClinicalTrials.gov, operated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 
Researchers are documenting ever-more cases in which unfavorable study results are withheld from the public. 
""The proposals take important steps toward greater transparency, but there are also disappointments,"" said Kay Dickersin, director of the Center for Clinical Trials at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 
One change would require that human studies funded even partly by the NIH, including surgical procedures and behavioral therapies such as for obesity, not only be registered at ClinicalTrials.gov but also report summary results. Previously, there was no such requirement. 
Absent NIH funding, clinical trials conducted on experimental or approved drugs regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would not have to report safety data. 
But researchers would be required to report other results, a significant expansion of the current requirement, which allows data to remain secret if, for instance, they find a drug or other therapy to be ineffective. 
""This proposed rule would close an important gap"" by making additional information about clinical trials publicly available, FDA commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg said in a statement. 
In a 2013 study, scientists found that of hundreds of trials they examined half never published results. An analysis of scores of studies of the influenza drug Tamiflu reported in April that published studies painted the drug as safer and more effective than confidential clinical-trial reports submitted to regulators. 
Johns Hopkins' Dickersin, who has criticized the lack of transparency in clinical trials, praised the requirement that studies of additional uses of approved drugs, such as whether a neuralgia drug also works against migraines, report results. Currently, doctors are permitted to prescribe such ""off-label"" use of approved drugs, never knowing whether a study showed they do not work for the additional disorder. 
One disappointment, Dickersin said, is that the proposals do not require researchers to reveal details of study protocols, such as what endpoints - heart attacks, for example - it aims for and how. That might let a manufacturer conceal unfavorable results. 
Of the 178,000 studies registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, summary results have been posted for 15,000.

273,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2014 11:30AM ET</span>",Senior Senate Democrat wants NY Fed chief to be presidential appointee,"By Howard Schneider 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior Democratic senator has introduced legislation that would make the head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank a presidential appointee subject to Senate confirmation. 
The bill by Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed, an influential voice on the Senate Banking Committee, comes ahead of a committee hearing on Friday at which New York Fed chief William Dudley will be the main witness. 
The head of the New York Fed plays an outsized role compared to the presidents of the 11 other Fed regional banks, with a permanent voting spot on the central bank's monetary policy committee and responsibility for carrying out the Fed's main monetary operations. 
The New York Fed also oversees some of the nation's largest financial institutions, and has been questioned in recent years for failing to look with enough rigor at the operations of companies like JPMorgan. The hearing on Friday will address the question of whether Fed regulators may be too soft on the banks they oversee. 
""Someone at this institution needs to be directly accountable to Congress,"" Reed said in a statement. ""This legislation is about holding the New York Fed accountable ... It's just too powerful to be left unchecked."" 
Like other regional Fed banks, the president of the New York Fed is appointed by the regional bank's board of directors, subject to the approval of the Fed's Washington-based board. 
The idea of making the job a presidential appointment is not a new one: with Reed's support it was included in the Senate's version of Wall Street reform legislation in 2010, although it was not included in the final Dodd-Frank law. 
Reed's bill shows the central bank is set to come under increased scrutiny from both the left and the right, given that the Republicans who will control both the House and the Senate next year have been particularly critical of Fed policies.

274,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2014 05:25AM ET</span>",Could Obama cut deal on Keystone pipeline? Don't rule it out,"By Steve Holland and Roberta Rampton 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama might be open to using the Keystone pipeline as leverage with Republicans if they cooperate on other aspects of his long-stalled domestic agenda, such as investing in infrastructure, closing tax loopholes or reducing carbon emissions. 
After years of fighting over TransCanada's crude oil pipeline from Canada, a Keystone deal is not entirely out of the question, sources inside the administration and others close to the White House told Reuters on Tuesday. 
With the Senate's narrow defeat of a Keystone bill on Tuesday, Obama avoided the awkward position of possibly vetoing a bill supported by members of his own Democratic party. But the issue will come up again soon after the new year when Republicans, who already control the House of Representatives, take charge of the Senate as well. 
Any deal would have to yield concrete gains for Obama on his agenda. Obama also likely would insist on making an executive decision on the $8 billion pipeline from Canada, rather than letting Congress approve the permit, sources said. 
""Whatever the president decides, I expect it will be driven by the bottom line on carbon pollution, not by symbolism,"" one former administration official told Reuters. 
Obama wants to make headway on slowing climate change during his last two years in office, but he has made it clear that new rules to curb carbon emissions from power plants and a global agreement on climate change are far more meaningful in the big picture than the fate of the pipeline. 
Sources close to the White House say Obama believes that both pipeline opponents and proponents have exaggerated the significance of their claims about the pipeline, turning it into a political symbol. 
But Republicans have vowed to take another run at forcing approval early in 2015. Assuming support from at least a handful of Democrats, Republicans likely would have enough votes to pass it but not enough to override a veto. 
Republicans could try to attach the measure to a government funding measure to make Obama's veto decision more difficult. 
A compromise would give Republicans a win on Keystone, a politically popular issue. But the White House would need to extract a win, too. 
Timing could be a hurdle to any potential deal. Obama has said he will wait for the Supreme Court of Nebraska to rule on a pipeline challenge from landowners in that state, a decision expected sometime between Friday and January. 
If the court sides with the landowners, the Keystone route would need to be approved by the state's Public Service Commission - a process that could take most of 2015. 
Obama has said he will approve the project if it does not hike carbon emissions, a standard cheered by green groups. 
""Ultimately, we believe that the Keystone pipeline would significantly exacerbate climate pollution, and therefore would flunk his test for approval,"" said Dan Weiss, senior vice president for campaigns at the League of Conservation Voters. 

But a State Department review found that blocking the pipeline would not stop Canada from developing its oil sands. Canada and the oil industry took that as a sign Obama could ultimately approve the pipeline.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bill to end the National Security Agency's bulk collection of telephone records failed on a procedural vote in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday after senior Republicans said it would benefit enemies of the United States, including Islamic State militants. 
The ""USA Freedom Act"" was supported by an unusual coalition of Democrats and conservative Republicans concerned about Americans' privacy, but failed 58 to 42, falling short of the 60 votes needed to move ahead. 
The measure is unlikely to become law anytime soon, as Republicans will hold a majority of seats in the Senate after Jan. 1. 
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, the future Senate Majority Leader, came out strongly against the bill in a Senate speech on Tuesday morning, concerns matched by several hawkish Republicans including former government officials. 
""If our aim is to degrade and destroy ISIL, as the president has said, then that's going to require smart policies and firm determination. At a minimum, we shouldn't be doing anything to make the situation worse,"" McConnell said. 
The legislation was the first considered by the full Senate that addressed privacy concerns raised last year after revelations by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden showing U.S. intelligence was collecting and storing communications metadata, such as the records of millions of Americans' telephone calls. 
Among other things, the bill would have required the NSA to ask a communications company for records of a specific person when investigating a terrorism case, rather than indiscriminately sweeping up records. 
The House of Representatives passed a similar, but less restrictive, version of the bill earlier this year. The White House had supported the legislation, denying assertions that it would benefit terrorist groups. 
The measure is not likely to be taken up again anytime soon. Republican successes in elections on Nov. 4 gave the party control of a majority of seats in the Senate and a larger majority in the House starting in January. 
Many U.S. technology companies also sought the changes after seeing their business suffer as foreign governments worried data might be handed over to American intelligence. 
A group of them, includingAOL Incc (N:AOL), Apple Inc (O:AAPL),Facebook Incc (O:FB),Google Incc (O:GOOGL),Microsoft Corpp (O:MSFT),Twitter Incc (N:TWTR) andYahoo Incc (O:YHOO), had sent a letter urging the Senate to pass the bill. 

The bill's backers vowed not to give up. ""I will continue to fight to preserve our constitution and our rights as Americans,"" said Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, the bill's lead sponsor, after its defeat.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama is poised to give relief from deportation to millions of undocumented immigrants who are parents of U.S. citizens or of permanent legal residents, according to a source familiar with White House deliberations. 
Obama has promised to lay out the details of an executive order on immigration. The action could come as early as this week. 
The source, who asked not to be identified, said some details were not yet available on which parents of citizens or permanent residents would be included. The Obama administration, the source said, had been looking at options including those parents who have been living in the United States for five years or 10 years. 
A top Obama aide is scheduled to have lunch with Senate Democrats on Thursday on Capitol Hill. White House chief of staff Denis McDonough, who will discuss the state of the economy and the post-election legislative agenda, is likely to be pressed on the immigration issue in the closed-door luncheon. 
On Monday, in an interview with Univision, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, said that Obama should move on immigration ""now."" 
Obama is expected to take actions to allow some undocumented people to live here at least temporarily without the threat of deportation and to hold jobs in the United States. Obama's executive order could also include further border security steps, according to sources. Obama is expected to stress that he wants to focus efforts on deportations of illegal residents with serious criminal backgrounds. 
Obama repeatedly has warned that he would take steps to fix immigration problems because Republicans in Congress have refused to pass legislation. He also has said that even with his unilateral steps, Congress could still replace his measures with permanent legislation. 
For the past two weeks, Republicans in Congress have been looking at ways to stop Obama from carrying out these anticipated actions, arguing that only Congress should initiate such moves through legislation. 

While the Senate in 2013 passed sweeping bipartisan immigration legislation, Republicans in the House of Representatives have blocked such a bill, saying they first want to concentrate on further securing U.S. borders.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bill to force approval of the Keystone XL pipeline failed in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, sparing President Barack Obama from an expected veto of legislation that several fellow Democrats supported. 
The measure fell just short of the 60 votes needed for passage, despite frantic last-minute lobbying by supporters, especially Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, who faces a runoff election on Dec. 6. She has staked her hopes of winning a fourth Senate term on the Keystone gambit. 
The tally was 59 to 41 on TransCanada Corp's $8 billion project, with all 45 Republicans supporting the bill. 
Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, who will become Senate Majority Leader in January after his party made big gains in this month's midterm elections, said after the vote that consideration of a Keystone bill would be ""very early up"" in the next congress.   
Obama opposed the Keystone bill and wants the State Department to finish its review of the pipeline. He has said he would not approve the pipeline if it significantly raised greenhouse gas emissions. 
If the bill had passed, Obama was widely expected to veto it, a power he has used only three times during his six years in office. Obama raised new questions about the project during a trip to Asia late last week, saying it would not lower gas prices for U.S. drivers but would allow Canada to ""pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else."" 
Republican Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota, who co-sponsored the Keystone bill with Landrieu, has pledged to keep trying to force approval of the project that the administration has kept under review for more than six years. 
Hoeven may introduce a new bill in January or February, or he could attach a Keystone measure to a broader bill that Obama would find difficult to veto. 
The Senate will have 63 ""yes"" votes for Keystone next year and is ""starting to coast"" to the 67 that would be needed to overturn an Obama veto, Hoeven predicted. ""Getting to that magic number is a possibility,"" he said. 
Despite the loss, Landrieu was upbeat. ""There's no blame, there's only joy in the fight,"" she told reporters. 
UNLOCK ITS BENEFITS 
Construction workers, unions and energy companies say the pipeline, which would transport more than 800,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta to Nebraska en route to the Gulf of Mexico, would create thousands of jobs. 
But the project has galvanized environmentalists who say developing Canada's oil sands would spike carbon emissions linked to climate change and that much of the oil would be sold abroad. 
Tom Steyer, the billionaire ex hedge-fund manager who raised millions of dollars to support environmentally-minded candidates in the midterm elections, said the Senate ""decided to stand on the right side of history."" 
The State Department has delayed a final decision on Keystone pending a legal decision in Nebraska over the pipeline's route that is expected in coming weeks. The department has said in previous reviews that Keystone would not significantly boost greenhouse gas emissions. 
Tuesday vote was taken hard in Canada where development of the oil sands is important to Alberta's budget. ""We are disappointed that U.S. politics continue to delay a decision on Keystone XL,"" a spokesman for Canada's Natural Resources Minister said via email. 
Russ Girling, the chief executive of TransCanada, said his company will not give up: ""We will continue to push for reason over gridlock, common sense over symbolism and solid science over rhetoric to approve Keystone XL and unlock its benefits."" 
TransCanada, which has already built a pipeline from the Gulf Coast that would connect with Keystone XL in Nebraska, says the new link would take two years to complete once approved. As oil prices have fallen more than 25 percent since the summer, the pipeline could be an increasingly important piece of the puzzle for development of the oil sands. 

TransCanada shares closed down 57 Canadian cents at C$56 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. Democratic senator came out against President Barack Obama's choice for a key U.S. Treasury Department post on Tuesday, adding to scrutiny over the nominee's involvement with corporate tax deals called ""inversions."" 
The White House last week announced Antonio Weiss, a top official at investment bank Lazard (N:LAZ), as Obama's choice to be the Treasury's under secretary for domestic finance. 
An aide to Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said the lawmaker opposes Weiss because of Lazard's work advising on recent high-profile inversions. 
In these deals, a U.S. company typically buys a foreign rival, then locates the tax domicile of the combined entities abroad to reduce taxation. Durbin and other Democratic lawmakers have slammed such moves as an attempt by U.S. companies to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. 
The Obama administration has sought to prevent a flurry of recent deals from growing, and the Treasury Department announced tough rules aimed at reducing the tax benefits in September. 
Several Senate Democrats have introduced bills that would further punish companies for inverting, but the proposals appear unlikely to succeed. Congress is only in session for a short period this year and Republicans who will control Congress next year do not support the proposals. 
After Burger King (N:BKW) said it would move its tax domicile to Canada as part of a deal to buy coffee-and-donut chain Tim Hortons (TO:THI), Durbin and four other lawmakers warned the burger joint's customers might choose to eat elsewhere in retribution. 
Lazard was one of several banks that advised on that deal. 
Durbin joins a small group of senators who have raised concerns about Weiss, the global head of investment banking at Lazard since 2009. Spokesmen for the White House and the Treasury Department did not immediately comment on Durbin's opposition to Weiss. 
""This nomination shows the continued hypocrisy of the Obama administration in this area,"" Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said last week. ""Ironically, this nominee might be especially well-equipped to advise the Obama administration on inversion policy."" 
Grassley sits on the committee that will vet the nomination. 
Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, also opposes Weiss, in part because of the inversion issue, her office confirmed. Warren's concerns were previously reported by Bloomberg News and Politico.

280,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2014 05:08PM ET</span>","Washington, D.C., approves landmark civil asset forfeiture law","By John Clarke 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - District of Columbia lawmakers approved legislation on Tuesday that makes it harder for police to seize assets from people who are not ultimately charged with crimes, a bill that backers say is a model for the rest of the country. 
The measure approved unanimously by Washington City Council prevents assets taken by police from going to the department, and instead earmarks them for the U.S. capital's general fund. 
Forfeiture laws let police seize property from people they stop, regardless of criminal charges. Seizures can include cash, cars and homes, which police are permitted to keep or sell. 
It has been estimated that up to 90 percent of civil forfeitures occur without a criminal charge, according to the bill's author, City Council member Tommy Wells. He also said the law wrongfully gave police a financial incentive to make seizures. 
The legislation overhauls the current law and provides property owners more protection, providing due process before police or prosecutors can seize property. 
""This is absolutely a model for other states and cities,"" said Darpana Sheth, an attorney for the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit civil liberties law firm in Arlington, Virginia. 
""Ideally, it would be eliminated. But short of that, reform is welcome."" 
Critics say some law enforcement agencies abuse forfeiture laws, which were created to fight organized crime. 
The value of seized assets grew to $4.3 billion nationwide in 2012 from $407 million in 2001, according to the Washington Post. Over that period, police seized $2.5 billion in cash from almost 62,000 people without warrants or indictments. 
Asset forfeiture attracted media attention after a police department in Montgomery County, Texas, used funds to purchase a margarita machine for office parties. Police in Worcester, Massachusetts, purchased a Zamboni ice resurfacing machine with the funds. 
Washington police have been criticized for earmarking $2.7 million for a ""special purpose fund"" in anticipated proceeds from future civil seizures. 
Police Chief Cathy Lanier said in a statement the department did not consider the funds as part of its budget. 
She said the money was used to augment ""confidential fund programs (witness protection, rewards for information in homicides)."" "

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, a Democrat, held out little chance of passing Trade Promotion Authority before the new Congress is sworn in January. TPA would prohibit Congress from amending trade deals, but would allow lawmakers to set negotiating objectives in return. 
When asked about the prospect of a TPA bill passing this year, Wyden said his committee was focused on legislation to extend temporary tax breaks 
""We have got 11 days or thereabouts; certainly tax extenders is front and center for the committee right now,"" said Wyden, who has been working for months on possible changes to a bipartisan TPA bill introduced in January. 
Business groups and many Republicans have called for the bill to be passed quickly to accelerate negotiations on a Pacific trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Some experts say trading partners will not put up their best offers if they fear lawmakers could later pick apart the deal. 
Wyden declined to comment when asked if TPA could be attached to the tax extenders legislation and said it was important that any final TPA package address issues including transparency, enforcement and governance. 
Some Democrats oppose TPA because they think it diminishes lawmakers' role in overseeing trade agreements, a concern also shared by some conservative Republicans. 
Fellow Democrat committee member Ben Cardin said TPA was unlikely to pass this year in any form. ""I think it's unlikely that you could reconcile the differences and get it through both the House and Senate,"" Cardin told reporters. 

He hoped Republicans, who will chair both the Senate Finance Committee and its House equivalent in the next Congress, would take Wyden's negotiations on possible changes to the bill into account, noting that would make it easier to win broad support for TPA.

Under a strategy suggested by House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, Congress next month would pass a bill funding the U.S. government through September, the end of the current fiscal year. That would avoid closure of the government in an ongoing battle with President Barack Obama over immigration policy. 
But once Obama issues his expected order on immigration policy, Congress could pass a separate bill known as a ""recisions"" bill cutting funding for those actions. 
Obama is expected to announce steps by year's end to allow possibly as many as five million undocumented residents remain in the United States without fear of deportation. The move likely would allow them to work legally, at least temporarily. 
Republicans, who will control the Senate as well as the House of Representatives in the new Congress that begins in January, are weighing how to respond. Many oppose what they say would amount to an ""amnesty"" by the president for undocumented immigrants. 
House Speaker John Boehner, asked by reporters if the recisions approach had merit, said ""maybe."" 
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said he would support whatever approach the Republican-controlled House approved. He added that arguments over funding between Republicans and the White House would continue for months. 
McConnell vowed just after the Nov. 4 election that there would be no more government shutdowns under a Republican-controlled Congress. But on Tuesday he said it was ""not unusual"" for Congress to use its spending powers to demand policy changes, adding that the two sides will have to work through their differences. 
""It's always appropriate to use power of the purse, but it's important to remember that the president has an important trump card; it's called the veto,"" McConnell said. ""So there will be ongoing negotiations in the various efforts to fund the government, both this year and next year, about priorities,"" he said. 

Advocates of Rogers' approach said it would be better than a short-term funding measure, or trying to deny funds pre-emptively to any move Obama makes. Congress needs to act to fund the government by Dec. 11, when existing money runs out.

283,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2014 04:12PM ET</span>","Turning to 2016, Republicans look to swing state governors","By Gabriel Debenedetti 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As attention turns to the 2016 presidential race, Republicans are taking a closer look at three governors from politically diverse states whose success in midterm elections this month bolstered their White House prospects. 
New Jersey's Chris Christie, Wisconsin's Scott Walker and Ohio's John Kasich feature prominently in a crowded field of Republicans because of their appeal to voters beyond the party's conservative base, pollsters and strategists said. 
The trio, along with three other potential candidates, will have the chance to show off their policy expertise while courting donors and media attention at a two-day Republican Governors Association meeting in Florida starting on Wednesday. 
For Christie, Walker and Kasich, the pitch will be simple: Republicans need a candidate who not only comes from outside the gridlocked halls of an unpopular Congress, but who also appeals to enough undecided, independent and Democratic Party voters to win in swing states that decide U.S. elections. 
""Voters are clear ... all roads lead to a governor or former governor,"" said independent pollster John Zogby. ""The critical mass says, 'Show me that you're a consensus builder and show me that you're a problem solver.'"" 
Party operatives say they are undeterred by the example of Republican Mitt Romney, a conservative former governor of liberal Massachusetts when he unsuccessfully ran for president in 2012. 
""Nobody thought we were going to carry Massachusetts,"" said Republican strategist Charlie Black. But the three governors represent key political battleground states. ""Having a favorite son in a New Jersey or an Ohio or a Wisconsin might make a difference,"" Black said. 
At least a dozen Republicans are weighing a White House race. Three other governors from more conservative states who are considering a run also will attend this week's meeting: Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Rick Perry of Texas and Mike Pence of Indiana. 
Christie, Walker and Kasich all benefited from the party's successful midterm election. 
Christie, who easily won re-election in 2013 in heavily Democratic New Jersey but suffered a setback with a ""Bridge-gate"" political retribution scandal, led the RGA to wins in Democratic states like Illinois and Maryland. 
Walker won re-election in a state that voted for President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Kasich won re-election in the crucial swing-state of Ohio by 32 points. 

The next presidential election is in November 2016. After two terms Obama, a Democrat, is barred from running again.

284,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2014 03:00PM ET</span>",Obama will not change policy against paying ransom for hostages,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama, who has ordered a comprehensive review of U.S. policy governing efforts to free American hostages, still opposes the payment of ransoms, the White House said on Tuesday. 
Obama ordered the review last summer in light of the increasing number of U.S. citizens taken hostage by the Islamic State and other militant groups. In recent months Islamic State militants have beheaded three Americans. 
White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters that Obama felt a review was warranted by the increased number of kidnappings of Americans. 
""The one thing that I do want to make clear, though, is, this review does not include a reconsideration about longstanding policy of the United States government that ransoms should not be paid to terrorist organizations that are holding hostages,"" Earnest said. 
He said Obama believes that paying ransoms could lead to trouble over the long term. 
""We don't want to put other American citizens at even greater risk when they're around the globe. And that, knowing that terrorist organizations can extract a ransom from the United States, if they take a hostage only puts American citizens at greater risk,"" he said.

Among the companies targeted in letters sent by Senator Elizabeth Warren, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, and Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, were banks, investment firms and other financial service providers. 
""The increasing number of cyber attacks and data breaches is unprecedented and poses a clear and present danger to our nation's economic security,"" Cummings and Warren wrote. 
""Each successive cyber attack and data breach not only results in hefty costs and liabilities for businesses, but exposes consumers to identity theft and other fraud, as well as a host of other cyber crimes,"" they added. 
The lawmakers requested details of all data breaches experienced over the past year, the number of customers affected, any findings by forensic investigators, information about who is suspected to have carried out the attacks, and descriptions of new cyber-security measures the companies instituted after discovering data breaches. 
In letters to two of the 16 companies, Citigroup and U.S. Bank, Cummings and Warren also requested information about how possible data breaches might have affected their handling of government purchase and charge cards under contracts with the General Services Administration, the government's housekeeping agency. 

Other institutions to whom the Democratic legislators are sending letters include ADP, Bank of America, Bank of NY Mellon, Bank of the West, Deutsche Bank, E-Trade, Fidelity, GE, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, PNC, Regions and Wells Fargo.

287,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2014 05:59AM ET</span>",Republican moderate urges Congress to avoid short-term spending bill ,"By David Lawder 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An influential House Republican moderate on Monday pushed back against an effort by conservatives to use a short-term spending extension to try to stop President Barack Obama from easing immigration policies. 
House of Representatives Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers urged Congress instead to pass a full-fledged government spending bill that lasts until Sept. 30, 2015. 
To do otherwise would be ""punting"" on important duties and put the United States ""on an uncertain and unstable fiscal path,"" Rogers wrote in an opinion piece published by the Roll Call newspaper. 
""Worst of all, it would send a signal to the American people, just weeks after they told us to get our acts together, that we haven't been listening,"" the Kentucky Republican wrote. 
Congress must authorize new federal spending by Dec. 11 to avoid a government shutdown. Rogers is currently negotiating with Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski to craft an ""omnibus"" spending bill that would last until Sept. 30, 2015. 
But more than 63 House conservatives have called for a short-term spending bill that would deny the funds needed to implement any executive action taken by Obama to issue identification cards or work permits to millions of undocumented immigrants. 
Such a strategy, which would ultimately threaten a government shutdown, is under discussion by Republican leaders in the House and Senate. 
Rogers also argued Congress should fully fund the government for 2015 so it can concentrate on other priorities next year, such as tax reform and reducing government regulations. 

""There simply won't be the necessary political bandwidth available to address these pressing issues if Congress is bogged down in old battles and protracted to-do lists,"" he wrote.

288,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2014 12:41AM ET</span>",Washington mayor nixed plea deal over 2010 campaign: report,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - District of Columbia Mayor Vincent Gray rejected a plea deal from federal prosecutors in connection with their probe of his 2010 election campaign, the Washington Post reported on Monday. 
Prosecutors in the U.S. capital offered Gray, a Democrat, a deal in September that called for him to plead guilty to one felony count, the newspaper said, citing a person with knowledge of the talks. 
Six people have pleaded guilty to federal crimes related to Gray's campaign since 2012. They include Jeffrey Thompson, a businessman accused of financing a shadow campaign for Gray. 
The Post said that in an interview Gray referred questions about the investigation to his attorney, Robert Bennett. The mayor denied any guilt, as he has throughout the three and a half years federal prosecutors have investigated the campaign. 
""What would I plead to? I don't know how to put it any other way than that,"" the Post quoted him as saying. 
Several people familiar with the case said prosecutors had reinterviewed witnesses in recent weeks, a sign they were moving closer to an indictment, the Post said. 
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bennett said in an email, ""If charged he (Gray) will vigorously fight the charges and expects to be vindicated."" 
Tainted by the scandal, Gray lost the Democratic primary in April to council member Muriel Bowser. She easily won the general election this month.
